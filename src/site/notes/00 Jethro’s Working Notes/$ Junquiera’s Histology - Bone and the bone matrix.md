### **BONE: INTRODUCTION**

As the main constituent of the adult skeleton, bone tissue supports fleshy structures, protects vital organs such as those in the cranial and thoracic cavities, and
harbors the bone marrow, where blood cells are formed. Bone also serves as a reservoir of calcium, phosphate, and other ions that can be released or stored in a
controlled fashion to maintain constant concentrations of these important ions in body fluids.

In addition, bones form a system of levers that multiply the forces generated during skeletal muscle contraction and transform them into bodily movements. This
mineralized tissue therefore confers mechanical and metabolic functions to the skeleton.

Bone is a specialized connective tissue composed of calcified intercellular material, the **bone matrix,** and three cell types:**Osteocytes** (Gr. *osteon,* bone + *kytos,* cell), which are found in cavities (**lacunae**) between layers (lamellae) of bone matrix (Figure 8–1)
**Osteoblasts** (*osteon* + Gr. *blastos,* germ), which synthesize the organic components of the matrix**Osteoclasts** (*osteon* + Gr. *klastos,* broken), which are multi-nucleated giant cells involved in the resorption and remodeling of bone tissue.

**Components of bone.**

The diagram shows an overview of the basic features of bone, including the three key cell types osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts; their usual locations; and the
typical lamellar organizations of bone. Osteoblasts secrete the matrix which then hardens by calcification, trapping the differentiating cells now called osteocytes in
individual lacunae. Osteocytes maintain the calcified matrix and receive nutrients from blood vessels via very small channels through the matrix called canaliculi.
Osteoclasts are monocyte-derived cells in bone which are important in bone remodeling.

The periosteum consists of dense connective tissue, with a primarily fibrous layer covering a more cellular layer. Bone is vascularized by small vessels that penetrate the
matrix from the periosteum.

Because metabolites are unable to diffuse through the calcified matrix of bone, the exchanges between osteocytes and blood capillaries depend on communication
through the **canaliculi** (L. *canalis,* canal), which are very thin, cylindrical spaces that perforate the matrix (Figure 8–1).

All bones are lined on both internal and external surfaces by layers of connective tissue containing osteogenic cells—**endosteum** on the internal surface and
**periosteum** on the external surface.

Because of its hardness, bone cannot be sectioned with the microtome, and special steps must be taken to study it histologically. A common technique that permits
the observation of the cells and the organic part of the matrix is based on the decalcification of bone preserved by standard fixatives. The mineral is removed by
immersion in a solution containing a calcium-chelating substance such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The decalcified tissue is then embedded, sectioned,
and stained as usual.
