## Stomach Emptying

Stomach emptying is promoted by intense peristaltic contractions in the stomach antrum. At the same time, emptying is opposed by varying degrees of resistance to passage of chyme at the pylorus.

## Intense Antral Peristaltic Contractions During Stomach Emptying—“Pyloric Pump.”

Most of the time, the rhythmic stomach contractions are weak and function mainly to cause mixing of food and gastric secretions. However, for about 20% of the time while food is in the stomach, the contractions become intense, beginning in midstomach and spreading through the caudad stomach. These contractions are strong peristaltic, very tight ringlike constrictions that can cause stomach emptying. As the stomach becomes progressively more and more empty, these constrictions begin farther and farther up the body of the stomach, gradually pinching off the food in the body of the stomach and adding this food to the chyme in the antrum. These intense peristaltic contractions often create 50 to 70 centimeters of water pressure, which is about six times as powerful as the usual mixing type of peristaltic waves.

When pyloric tone is normal, each strong peristaltic wave forces up to several milliliters of chyme into the duodenum. Thus, the peristaltic waves, in addition to causing mixing in the stomach, also provide a pumping action called the “pyloric pump.”

## Role of the Pylorus in Controlling Stomach Emptying

The distal opening of the stomach is the *pylorus.* Here the thickness of the circular wall muscle becomes 50% to 100% greater than in the earlier portions of the stomach antrum, and it remains slightly tonically contracted almost all the time. Therefore, the pyloric circular muscle is called the *pyloric sphincter.*

Despite normal tonic contraction of the pyloric sphincter, the pylorus usually is open enough for water and other fluids to empty from the stomach into the duodenum with ease. Yet, the constriction usually prevents passage of food particles until they have become mixed in the chyme to almost fluid consistency. The degree of constriction of the pylorus is increased or decreased under the influence of nervous and hormonal signals from both the stomach and the duodenum, as discussed shortly.
