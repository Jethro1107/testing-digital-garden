**BONE MATRIX**

Inorganic material represents about 50% of the dry weight of bone matrix. Hydroxyapatite is most abundant, but bicarbonate, citrate, magnesium, potassium, and
sodium are also found. Significant quantities of amorphous (noncrystalline) CaPO4 are also present. The surface ions of hydroxyapatite are hydrated and a layer of
water and ions forms around this crystal. This layer, the **hydration shell,** facilitates the exchange of ions between the crystal and the body fluids.

**MEDICAL APPLICATION**

In the genetic disease **osteopetrosis**, which is characterized by dense, heavy bones ("marble bones"), the osteoclasts lack ruffled borders, and bone
resorption is defective.

The organic matter embedded in the calcified matrix is type I collagen and ground substance, which contains proteoglycan aggregates and several specific
multiadhesive glycoproteins, including **osteonectin**. Calcium-binding glycoproteins, notably osteocalcin, and the phosphatases released in matrix vesicles by
osteoblasts promote calcification of the matrix. Other tissues containing type I collagen do not contain these glycoproteins or matrix vesicles and are not normally
calcified. Because of its high collagen content, decalcified bone matrix is usually acidophilic.

*The association of minerals with collagen fibers is responsible for the hardness and resistance of bone tissue. After a bone is decalcified, its shape is preserved, but it
becomes as flexible as a tendon. Removal of the organic part of the matrix—which is mainly collagenous—also leaves the bone with its original shape; however, it
becomes fragile, breaking and crumbling easily when handled.*
