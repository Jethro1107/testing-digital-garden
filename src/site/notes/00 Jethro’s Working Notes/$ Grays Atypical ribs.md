## Rib I

**Rib I** is flat in the horizontal plane and has broad superior and inferior surfaces. From its articulation with vertebra TI, it slopes inferiorly to its attachment to the manubrium of the sternum. The head articulates only with the body of vertebra TI and therefore has only one articular surface. Like other ribs, the tubercle has a facet for articulation with the transverse process. The superior surface of the rib is characterized by a distinct tubercle, the **scalene tubercle** , which separates two smooth grooves that cross the rib approximately midway along the shaft. The anterior groove is caused by the subclavian vein, and the posterior groove is caused by the subclavian artery. Anterior and posterior to these grooves, the shaft is roughened by muscle and ligament attachments.

## Rib II

**Rib II** , like rib I, is flat but twice as long. It articulates with the vertebral column in a way typical of most ribs.

## Rib X

The head of **rib X** has a single facet for articulation with its own vertebra.

## Ribs XI and XII

**Ribs XI** and **XII** articulate only with the bodies of their own vertebrae and have no tubercles or necks. Both ribs are short, have little curve, and are pointed anteriorly.
