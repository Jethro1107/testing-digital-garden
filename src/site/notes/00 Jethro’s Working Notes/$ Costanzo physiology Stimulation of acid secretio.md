## Substances That Alter HCl Secretion

Three substances stimulate H + secretion by gastric parietal cells: histamine (a paracrine), ACh (a neurocrine), and gastrin (a hormone). Each substance binds to a different receptor on the parietal cell and has a different cellular mechanism of action ( [Fig. 8.18](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0095) ). In addition, there are indirect effects of ACh and gastrin via stimulation of histamine release.

- **Histamine** is released from ECL cells in the gastric mucosa and diffuses via a paracrine mechanism to the nearby parietal cells, where it binds to **H 2 receptors.** The second messenger for histamine is **cAMP.** Histamine binds to H 2 receptors, which are coupled to adenylyl cyclase by a G s protein. When adenylyl cyclase is activated, there is increased production of cAMP. cAMP activates protein kinase A, leading to secretion of H + by the parietal cells. **Cimetidine** blocks H 2 receptors and blocks the action of histamine on parietal cells.
- **ACh** is released from vagus nerves innervating the gastric mucosa and binds directly to **muscarinic (M 3 ) receptors** on the parietal cells. The second messengers for ACh are **IP 3 /Ca 2+ .** When ACh binds to muscarinic receptors, phospholipase C is activated. Phospholipase C liberates diacylglycerol and IP 3 from membrane phospholipids, and IP 3 then releases Ca 2+ from intracellular stores. Ca 2+ and diacylglycerol activate protein kinases that produce the final physiologic action: H + secretion by the parietal cells. **Atropine** blocks muscarinic receptors on parietal cells and, accordingly, blocks the action of ACh.
    
    ACh also increases H + secretion indirectly by stimulating ECL cells to release histamine, which then acts on the parietal cells as described earlier.
    
- **Gastrin** is secreted into the circulation by G cells in the stomach antrum. Gastrin reaches the parietal cells by an endocrine mechanism, *not* by local diffusion within the stomach. Thus gastrin is secreted from the stomach antrum into the systemic circulation and then delivered *back* to the stomach via the circulation. Gastrin binds to cholecystokinin B (CCK B ) receptors on the parietal cells. (The CCK B receptor has equal affinity for gastrin and CCK, whereas the cholecystokinin A [CCK A ] receptor is specific for CCK.) Like ACh, gastrin stimulates H + secretion through the **IP 3 /Ca 2+** second messenger system. The stimuli that trigger gastrin secretion from the G cells are discussed in detail subsequently. Briefly, these stimuli are distention of the stomach, presence of small peptides and amino acids, and stimulation of the vagus nerves.
    
    Like ACh, gastrin also stimulates H + secretion indirectly by causing release of histamine from ECL cells.

    The rate of H+ secretion is regulated by the independent actions of histamine, ACh, and gastrin, as well as by *interactions* among the three agents. The interaction is called **potentiation,**which refers to the ability of two stimuli to *produce a combined response that is greater than the sum of the individual responses*. One explanation for potentiation in the parietal cells is that each agent stimulates H+ secretion via a different receptor and, in the case of histamine, a different second messenger. Another explanation derives from the fact that both ACh and gastrin stimulate histamine release from ECL cells and thereby induce H+ secretion by a second, indirect, route. This phenomenon of potentiation has consequences for the actions of the various drugs that inhibit H+ secretion. For example, because histamine potentiates the actions of ACh and gastrin, H2 receptor–blocking agents such as **cimetidine** have a greater effect than expected: They block the direct action of histamine *and* they also block the histamine-potentiated effects of ACh and gastrin. In another example, ACh potentiates the actions of histamine and gastrin. A consequence of this potentiation is that muscarinic-blocking agents such as **atropine** block the direct effects of ACh *and* the ACh-potentiated effects of histamine and gastrin.
    
    ## Stimulation of H + Secretion
    
    Having established that histamine, ACh, and gastrin all stimulate HCl secretion by parietal cells, the control of HCl secretion in response to a meal now can be discussed in an integrated fashion. [Figure 8.19](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0100) depicts the gastric parietal cells, which secrete HCl, and the G cells, which secrete gastrin. Vagus nerves innervate parietal cells directly, where they release ACh as the neurotransmitter. Vagus nerves also innervate G cells, where they release GRP as the neurotransmitter.

As shown in [Figure 8.19](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0100) , the second path, the G cell path, provides an *indirect* route for vagal stimulation of the parietal cells: Vagal stimulation releases gastrin from the G cells, and gastrin enters the systemic circulation and is delivered back to the stomach to stimulate H + secretion by the parietal cells. One consequence of this dual action of vagal stimulation is that muscarinic-blocking agents such as **atropine** do not block HCl secretion completely. Atropine *will* block the direct vagal effects on the parietal cells, which are mediated by ACh, but it *will not* block the vagal effects on gastrin secretion because the neurotransmitter at the synapses on G cells is GRP, not ACh.

Gastric HCl secretion is divided into three phases: cephalic, gastric, and intestinal. The cephalic and gastric phases are illustrated in [Figure 8.19](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0100) .

- The **cephalic phase** accounts for approximately **30%** of the total HCl secreted in response to a meal. The stimuli for HCl secretion in the cephalic phase are **smelling** and **tasting,** chewing, swallowing, and **conditioned reflexes** in anticipation of food. Two mechanisms promote HCl secretion in the cephalic phase. The first mechanism is direct stimulation of the parietal cell by vagus nerves, which release ACh. The second mechanism is indirect stimulation of the parietal cells by gastrin. In the indirect path, vagus nerves release GRP at the G cells, stimulating gastrin secretion; gastrin enters the circulation and stimulates the parietal cells to secrete HCl.
- The **gastric phase** accounts for approximately **60%** of the total HCl secreted in response to a meal. The stimuli for HCl secretion in the gastric phase are **distention** of the stomach and the presence of breakdown products of protein, **amino acids and small peptides.** Four physiologic mechanisms are involved in the gastric phase. The first two mechanisms, which are initiated by distention of the stomach, are similar to those utilized in the cephalic phase: Distention causes direct vagal stimulation of the parietal cells and indirect stimulation of the parietal cells via gastrin release. The third mechanism is initiated by distention of the stomach antrum and involves local reflexes that stimulate gastrin release. The fourth mechanism is a direct effect of amino acids and small peptides on the G cells to stimulate gastrin release. In addition to these physiologic mechanisms, **alcohol** and **caffeine** also stimulate gastric HCl secretion.
- The **intestinal phase** accounts for only **10%** of HCl secretion (not shown in [Figure 8.19](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0100) ) and is mediated by products of protein digestion.
