### Protease in COPD

- **What are proteases?**
    
    Enzyme that catalyze hydrolysis of bonds between amino acids
    
- Classification of protease
    - **Types of protease by action**
        
        Exopeptidase:
        
        Non-specific in action, responsible for cleaving terminal amino acids
        
        e.g. Aminopeptidase (cleaves terminal amino acid at N-terminal), Carboxypeptidase (cleaves terminal amino acid at C-terminal)
        
        Endopeptidase:
        
        Specific in action, responsible for cleaving internal bonds

    - **Types of protease by substrate**
        
        e.g. Elastase - hydrolyzes elastin
        
        Collagenase - hydrolyzes collagen
        
        Serine protease
        
        Cystine protease
        
        Aspartyl/Acid protease
        
        Metalloproteinase
        
- **Proteases in pathologic processes**
    
    Protease are involved in innate immunity, wound healing, tumor invasion, and inflammation
    
    e.g. Neutrophil elastase and MMPs are important protease in COPD
    

### COPD: histological and pathological summary

- Emphysema
    
    
    - **Histopathology of emphysema**
        
        Loss of alveolar septal tissue
        
        Enlarged alveolar spaces

    - **Pathophysiology of emphysema**
        
        Apoptosis and destruction of alveolar tissue, results in:
        
        Diffusion impairments:
        
        Due to loss of surface area for gas exchange
        
        Airway obstruction:
        
        Due to degradation of extracellular matrix, it results in loss of elastic recoil of on small airways, resulting in decreased radial traction on small airways and premature closure of small airways during expiration
        
        This results in air trapping as well (deadspace)
        
- Chronic Bronchitis
    
    
    - **Pathology of chronic bronchitis**
        
        Mucus plug, due to mucus gland hypertrophy leading to small airway obstruction
        
        Chronic inflammation of the airway wall
        
        Peribronchial fibrosis

- **Upstream cause of pathology in COPD**
    
    Chronic inflammation
    
    - **How does chronic inflammation occur in COPD (pathogenesis)?**
        
        Irritants (cigarette smoke) reacts with epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, causing them to release TNF-alpha
        
        TNF-alpha  activates transcription factor NF-kappaB, master regulator of inflammation, regulating expression of chemotactic factors IL-8 and Leukotriene B4 (LTB4), enabling chemotaxis of neutrophils and CD8+ T cells, thus establish inflammation
        
        Chronic smoking results in repeated bouts of inflammation, thus establishing chronic inflammation

    - **Why does chronic inflammation results in pathology of COPD?**
        
        Inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages are rich in protease and ROS
        
        This results in oxidative stress:
        
        ROS causes apoptosis and tissue damage
        
        This also results in protease-antiprotease imbalance:
        
        Upregulation of protease due to release by inflammatory cells: Elastase, MMPs (e.g. MMP-12)
        
        Downregulation of anti-protease due to inhibition by protease and ROS: alpha-1-antitrypsin, SLPI (secretory leukprotease inhibitors), TIMPs
        
        This results in emphysema, mucus hypersecretion and peribronchial fibrosis

### Neutrophil elastase in COPD

- **What are neutrophil elastase?**
    
    Serine protease in azurophilic granules of neutrophils, released in activation and degranulation of neutrophils
    
- **Functions of neutrophil elastase**
    
    Acts as a protease:
    
    Matrix protein - elastin, collagen
    
    Anti-protease - TIMP, SLPI

    Acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator:
    
    Increases expression of IL-8 for chemotaxis of neutrophils
    
- **Action of anti-protease against neutrophil elastase**
    
    Alpha-1-antitrypsin expressed in the liver coats the lungs, protecting the lung from neutrophil elastase

    - **Pathogenesis of primary emphysema**
        
        Mutation in SERPINA1 gene in chromosome 14 causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
        
        The lung lacks alpha-1 antitrypsin coating, resulting in protease-antiprotease imbalance
        
        This results in excessive damage from neutrophil elastase, resulting in primary emphysema
        

### Matrix Metalloproteinase in COPD

- **What are matrix metalloproteinases?**
    
    Calcium-dependent, zinc-containing endopeptidase
    
- **MMPs important in COPD and their production**
    
    MMP1, MMP2, MMP9 and MMP12 are important in the pathogenesis of COPD
    
    They are produced by epithelial cells, macrophages and neutrophils
    
- **Substrate of MMPs**
    
    Matrix proteins - elastin, collagen
    
    Growth factors - TGF-beta
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 2.42.39 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 2.42.39 PM.png]]
    
- **What is MMP12 and its function?**
    
    MMP is a macrophage matalloelastase
    
    It has 3 functions:
    
    1. Degrade elastin
    2. Inhibit anti-proteases alpha-1 antitrypsin and TIMPs
    3. Respobsible for recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and their function, hence, activity of neutrophil elastase depends on MMP12

- **Action of TGF-beta and its activation**
    
    TGF-beta is produced by epithelial cells as a proprotein, and is cleaved by MMP2 and MMP9 for activation
    
    After activation, TGF-beta acts as a chemotactic factor for fibroblast, stimulating deposition of ECM around airways, resulting in peribronchial fibrosis

### Neutrophil-mediated mucus hypersecretion in chronic bronchitis

- **How do neutrophils mediate mucus hypersecretion in chronic bronchitis?**
    
    Neutrophils release TNF-alpha, and ROS
    
    TNF-alpha stimulate the EGFR expression on epithelial cell, whereas ROS activate EGFR
    
    Upon activation of EGFR, it results in mucin production, and stimulates differentiation of basal cells into mucin-containing goblet cells, resulting in mucin upregulation and goblet cell hyperplasia and metaplasia
    
    Neutrophil elastase also stabilizes mucin RNA, resulting in increased mucin production
    
    Neutrophil release elastase, cathepsin G, proteinase 3, which stimulate mucin secretion
