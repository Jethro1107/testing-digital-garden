### Non-typhoidal salmonellae

- **Transmission of non-typhoidal salmonellae**
    
    Non-typhoidal salmonellae is transmitted via zoonosis, or by food-bourne transmission.
    
- **Pathogenesis of non-typhoidal salmonellae**
    
    It is mediated by exotoxins and intracellular survival in macrophages.
    
- **Clinical manifestations of non-typhoidal salmonellae**
    
    It can cause gastroenteritis:
    
    Incubation period of around 8 to 48 hours.
    
    It classically presents as diarrhoea, which may be watery or dysentery-like, with or without abdominal and systemic symptoms.
    
    1-4% of individuals develop transient bacteremia.
    
    Non-typhoidal salmonellae is also an important cause of bacteraemia and disseminated infection (mycotic aneurysm, [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Osteomyelitis\|Osteomyelitis]], abscesses), in both immunocompetent and immunocomprimised individuals.
    
    Due to intracellular survival in macrophages, it establishes a chronic carrier state.
    
- **Management of non-typhoidal salmonellae**
    
    *Fluid and electrolyte replacement* and other supportive treatment is provided.
    
    *Antibiotic therapy*. Fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporin is given when necessary.
