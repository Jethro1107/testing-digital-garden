    - Overview of differentiation of mesoderm
        - Paraxial mesoderm

                - The two medial walls of the expanding portions will approach each other and fuse
                - The septum will never completely separate the lumen, leaving a communicating canal between the two expanded portions, which is closed secondarily by neighboring proliferating tissues

        - When sinus horn is incorporated with right atrium, septum secundum (a sickle-shaped crest) is formed, extending towards the endocardial cushion of Atrioventricular canal, covering ostium secundum
        - The opening left in the septum secundum forms the foramen ovale, and when the upper part of septum primum dissapears, the remaining part becomes the valve of foramen ovale

        - Transposition of great vessels
            - Cause of transposition of great vessels
                - Conotruncal septum fails to follow normal spiralling course, such that it runs straight down, causing transposition of aorta and pulmonary artery
            - Effects of transposition of great vessels
                - Decreased oxygen in blood
    - Formation of semilunar valves ↓
        - When partitioning of truncus is complete, primordia of semilunar valves are visible as small tubercles on aortic and pulmonary channels
        - 3 tubercles can be found on each channel

        - Tubercles hollow out on their upper surface, forming semilunar valves
