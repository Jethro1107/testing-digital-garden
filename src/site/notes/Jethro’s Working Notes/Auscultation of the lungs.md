# Auscultation of the lungs

### Clinical skills - Auscultation of the lungs

Auscultation of the lungs should be performed on both lung apices, the intercostal spaces both anteriorly and posteriorly, and laterally.

Compare breath sounds on both sides:

Normal - Vesicular breath sounds

Reduced breath sounds - lung collapse, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, emphysema, thick chest wall, poor chest movement

Increased breath sounds - thin chest wall, increased respiratory efforts

Bronchial breath sounds - Consolidations

Crackles

Crepitations

Wheezing
