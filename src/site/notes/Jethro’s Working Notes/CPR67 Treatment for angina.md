### Angina - Introduction

- **Classification of angina**
    - Stable angina (typical angina)
        - **What is stable angina?**
            
            Stable angina is the most common form of angina
            
            It is a predictable episodic chest pain associated with particular levels of exertion or some other cause of increased myocardial demand
            
        - **Clinical features of stable angina**
            
            Crushing, squeezing substernal sensation, chest tightness, where pain radiates to the left arm or left jaw (referred pain)
            
        - **Major cause of stable angina**
            
            Fixed atherosclerotic stenosis (>75% stenosis)
            
        - **Relieve of stable angina**
            
            Rest (reducing demand)
            
            Vasodilators (e.g. CCBs)
            
    - Unstable angina (cresendo angina)
        - **What is unstable angina?**
            
            Unstable angina is characterised by patterns of increasingly frequent, prolonged chest pains, precipitated by lesser extent of exertion and even occuring at rest
            
        - **Major cause of unstable angina**
            
            Associated with disruption of atherosclerotic plaque, superimposed thrombosis, embolization of thrombus and/or vasospasm, resulting in an incommplete occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery

    - Variant angina (Vasospastic/prinzmetal angina)
        - **What is variant angina?**
            
            Variant/Vasospastic/prinzmetal angina is an uncommon form of angina that occurs at rest
            
        - **Major cause of variant angina**
            
            Caused by coronary artery spasm
            
    
    Cf: [[Robbins  Angina pectoris\|Robbins  Angina pectoris]] 
    
- **Mechanisms of antianginal drugs**
    - Increase perfusion of the myocardium by dilation of coronary vasculature
        - **Types of antianginal drugs involved in increased coronary perfusion**
            
            Nitrates, CCB, Nicorandil
            
        - Coronary steal phenomenon
            - **Responses to coronary stenosis**
                
                There are 2 responses to coronary stenosis:
                
                1. Distal arterioles become maximally dilated
                2. Development of collateral blood supply to shunt blood from well perfused areas to ischaemic areas

            - **Principle of coronary steal syndrome**
                1. Administration of a vasodilator will not further dilate the arterioles distal to the coronary stenosis as it is maximally dilated
                2. Collateral blood supply is not dilated when administer non-selective vasodilator
                3. Vasodilation occurs in the arterioles supplying well-perfused areas
                
                This shunts blood flow from ischemic area to well-perfused area, causing worsened myocardial ischemia in the myocardium supplied by the stenosed artery and progression of angina symptoms

            - **Coronary steal phenomenon is the principal behind…**
                
                Pharmacological stress test in the assessment of cardiac risk
                
    - Decrease myocardial metabolic demand by reducing cardiac workload
        - **Types of antianginal drugs involved in decrease myocardial demand**
            
            Nitrates, Calcium channel blockers, Beta-blockers, trimetazidine, Ranolazine, Ivabradine
            

### First line treatment of Angina

- Nitrates
    - **Examples of nitrate**
        
        Nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate
        
    - **MOA of nitrate as an antianginal drug**
        - Nitrates cause VSMC relaxation and thus vasodilation
            
            Nitrates are bioactivated by the release of nitric oxide (NO)
            
            NO binds to soluble guanalyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of cGMP, activating protein kinase G
            
            Protein kinase G phosphorylate SERCA, causing increased sequesteration of Ca2+, resulting in decreased intracellular Ca2+ concentration
            
            Protein kinase G also phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase, causing decrease MLCK actvity
            
            Myosin phosphatase removes phosphate group from myosin heads, inhibiting actin-myosin interaction, causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation
            
        - This vasodilator effect of nitrate is central to the mechanisms of its antianginal effects:
            1. Main mechanism: Effective vasodilation of veins
                
                Vasodilation of veins increases venous capacitance, thus decreasing venous return
                
                This decreases cardiac output, decreasing cardiac workload and thus decreases myocardial demand
                
            2. Effective vasodilation of large arteries
                
                Vasodilation of arteries may mildly decrease total peripheral resistance and thus blood pressure
                
                This decreases afterload, thus decreasing cardiac workload and myocardial demand
                
            3. Effective vasodilation of collateral coronary arteries
                
                Vasodilation of collateral coronary arteries prevents blood from being shunted from the ischemic region to well-perfused region, thus mitigating the coronary steal phenomenon, increasing blood flow to ischemic regions
                
            4. Reduced coronary spasm
                
                Vasodilation of coronary arteries enables effective treatment against variant angina
                
        
        Cf: [[Pharmacology and toxicology  Pharmacodynamics of nitrates\|Pharmacology and toxicology  Pharmacodynamics of nitrates]], [[  Molecular basis of smooth muscle relaxation   \|  Molecular basis of smooth muscle relaxation   ]], [[  Effects of decreased venous compliance on venous return, cardiac output and mean systemic filling pressure  \|  Effects of decreased venous compliance on venous return, cardiac output and mean systemic filling pressure  ]] 
        
    - **Pharmacokinetics of nitrates**
        1. First pass effect
            
            Low oral bioavailability, thus sublingual route of administration is preferred
            
        2. Rapid onset of action
        3. Short half life and short duration of action
        4. Excretion by kidneys
        
        Cf: [[Pharmacology and toxicology  Pharmacokinetics of nitrates\|Pharmacology and toxicology  Pharmacokinetics of nitrates]] 
        
    - **Complications with nitrates**
        1. Tolerance/Tachyphylaxis
            
            Reduced response to the same dose due to continuous exposure of the drug, e.g. the use of long acting nitrates, i.e. isosorbide dinitrate or sustained release solutions of nitroglycerins
            
            Reduced tolerance can be achieved by:
            
            1. Avoid high doses of nitrate
            2. Administration with a nitrate-free period of 8-12 hours, usually at night, since there is lower myocardial demand
        2. Dependence
            
            Withdrawal of drug may result in coronary spasm, thus cannot withdraw nitrate abruptly from a patient after chronic therapy
            
    - **Adverse effects of nitrates**
        
        Reduced cerebral blood flow - Headaches
        
        Increased venous capacitance - Orthostatic hypotension and syncope
        
        Reduced blood pressure - Reflex tachycardia
        
    - **Contraindications and precautions of nitrates**
        
        Patients with elevated intracranial pressure
        
        Cautious in patients taking certain drugs:
        
        PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil) - Increase cGMP levels, thus increasing effect of nitrate
        
        Stimulates of soluble guanylyl cyclase (riociguat) - Increased cGMP levels, thus increasing effect of nitrate
        
        Increased effect of nitrate may result in hypotension and reflex tachycardia
        
    - **Characteristics of different preparation of nitrates and use cases**
        - Sublingual administration
            
            Fast onset and short duration of action
            
            For immediate relief and for prevention of angina prior to exercise or stress
            
        - Oral administration
            
            Low oral bioavailability due to first pass, thus higher dose and sustained release preparations used
            
            Prophylaxis against anginal episodes in patients with more than occasional angina
            
        - Cutaneous administration
            
            Slow onset
            
            Control of nocturnal angina
            
        - Buccal administration
            
            Sustained release via transmucosal route
            
            For short term prophylaxis
            
        - Intravenous administration
            
            Rapid and safety titration of doses
            
            For relief of coronary vasospasm
            
- Calcium channel blockers
    
    
    - **3 structural class of CCB and examples**
        
        Vasular sensitive:
        
        dihydropyridines - nifedipine, amlodipine
        
        Cardiac sensitive:
        
        benzodiazapine - diltiazem
        
        Phenylalkylamine - verapamil
        
    - **MOA of CCB as an antianginal drug**
        1. CCB result in negative chronotropy, dromotropy and inotropy
            
            This causes decreased cardiac workload, and thus reduces myocardial demand
            
        2. CCB are effective vasodilators
            
            This causes decreased peripheral resistance, thus decreasing blood pressure
            
            This reduces afterload, reducing cardiac workload and thus reducing myocardial demand
            
        3. CCB reduce coronary spasm
            
            Vasodilation of coronary arteries enables effective treatment against variant angina
            
    
    - **Adverse effect of CCB**
        
        For all CCB:
        
        Hypotension - due to decreased vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output
        
        For vascular-selective CCB:
        
        Reflex tachycardia due to drop in blood pressure (and little effect of CCB on cardiomyocytes)
        
        Oedema, due to increased capillary blood flow
        
        Flushing due to vasodilation
        
        For cardiac-selective CCB:
        
        Reduced cardiac output may precipitate into heart failure
        
- Beta-blockers
    - **Examples of beta-blockers**
        
        Propanalol, metaprolol
        
    - **MOA of beta-blockers as an antianginal drug**
        
        Reduce sympathetic stimulation of the heart, thus reducing heart rate and contractility
        
        This decreases cardiac workload and myocardial demand
        
    - **Adverse effect of beta blockers**
        1. Risk of arrhythmia and heart failure
        2. Central nervous system disturbance (vivid dreams, depression)
        3. Bronchospasm
            
            Contraindicated in asthma
            
        4. Hypoglycemia
            
            Contraindicated in diabetes mellitus
            
        5. Risk of vasospasm
            
            Contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease and vasospastic disorder
            

### Alternative pharmacological treatments of angina

- Nicorandil
    - **MOA of nicorandil**
        
        Nitrate-like vasodilator properties:
        
        Increases cGMP production, activating protein kinase G, enabling vasodilation
        
        Activates ATP-sensitive K+ channels:
        
        Enabling K+ reflux, resulting in hyperpolerization of VSMC, and thus vasodilation
        
        This can reduce coronary spasm and is effective for variant angina
        
        Note: Nicorandil’s effect on haemodynamic profile is similar to that of nitrates and vascular selective CCBs
        
    - **Adverse effects of nicorandil**
        
        Similar to nitrates:
        
        Reduced cerebral blood flow - headaches
        
        Increased venous capacitance - Hypotension
        
        Reduced blood pressure - reflex tachycardia
        
        Increase risk of gastric ulcerations and perforation
        
- Trimetazidine
    - **MOA of trimetazidine**
        
        Inhibit long chain 3-ketoacyl thiolase (3-KAT) for beta-oxidation of fatty acids:
        
        This inhibits fatty acid oxidation
        
        This causes a metabolic shift to oxygen efficient fuel like glucose, thus reducing myocardial demand
        
    - **Adverse effects of trimetazidine**
        
        Mild - GI disturbance, muscle cramps, diziness
        
        Parkinson’s syndrome (by blocking dopamine receptors)
        
- Ranolazine
    - **MOA of ranolazine**
        
        Inhibits late Na+ current, resulting in reduced influx of Na+
        
        ![[paste-32293859098625.jpg\|paste-32293859098625.jpg]]
        
        This decreases the activation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger for expelling Na+ and influx of Ca2+, preventing Ca2+ overload
        
        This decreases contractility of the heart, causing decreased myocardial demand

        Note that:
        
        At doses above clinical dose, ranolazine has an aditional 2 effects,
        
        It inhibits fatty acid oxidation, causing a metabolic shift to oxygen efficient fuel like glucose, thus reducing metabolic demand
        
        It inhibits Na+ channel in vascular smooth muscle cells:
        
        This decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels, causing vasodilation in coronary vasculature and increases coronary perfusion
        
    - **Adverse effect of ranolazine**
        
        Mild - nausea, dizziness, headaches, constipation
        
    - **Metabolism of ranolazine**
        
        Metabolized by CYP3A4
        
    - **Contraindications for ranolazine**
        
        Hepatic cirrhosis
        
        Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors
        
        Long QT syndrome - ranolazine inhibits potassium current in cardiomyocyte
        
- Ivabradine
    - **MOA of ivabradine**
        
        Inhibits HCN channels in SA node:
        
        This inhibits inward funny current, thus decreasing rate of depolarization
        
        This decreases automaticity and decreases heart rate
        
        This decreases cardiac workoad, thus decrease myocardial demand
        
        This increases diastolic time, thus increases coronary perfusion
        
    - **Adverse effect of ivabrandine**
        
        Bradycardia - dizziness, weakness, SOB
        
        Phosphene (flashes of light) and blurred vision - due to inhibition of Ih current in retinal cells
        
        Atrial fibrillation (when automaticity of SA node is reduced, causing ectopic pacemaker)
        
    - **Patient selection for ivabradine**
        
        > 70 bpm
        
        Chronic stable angina with normal sinus rhythm
        
        Reserved for patients not responding to beta-blockers
        
    - **Contraindications for ivabradine**
        
        Bradycardia and hypotension
        
        Concurrent cardiac disease
        
        Hepatic impairment
        
        Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors
