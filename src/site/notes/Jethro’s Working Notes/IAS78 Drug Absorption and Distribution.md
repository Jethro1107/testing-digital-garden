### Pharmacokinetics Principles

- What are the different mechanisms for transport of drug across the cell membrane?
    
    Unbound drugs and small, water-soluble drugs: 
    
    - By bulk flow of water (moves solute and solvent) across cell membrane
    
    Protein-bound drugs or large drugs:
    
    - By carrier proteins on cell membrane
    - Paracellular transport through intracellular space
- What are the characteristics of the drugs that affects its movement across a cell membrane?
    - Molecular size - Determines whether a drug can be transported by bulk flow of water
    - Molecular shape - Determines whether a drug can be transported by carrier proteins
    - Degree of ionization - Determines whether a drug is subjected to ion trapping
    - Relative lipid solubility - Determines whether a drug can pass through the lipid membrane
    - Binding to plasma proteins or tissue proteins - Determines drug mobility
- Describe the properties of passive membrane transport of drugs across the membrane.
    
    Drug pass through the membrane by simple diffusion
    
    Rate of diffusion is subjected to Fick's Law, factors affecting rate include:
    
    - Concentration gradient (increase gradient, increase rate)
    - Lipid-water partition coefficient (increase coefficient, increase rate)
    - Thickness (decrease thickness, increase rate)
    - Surface area (Increase surface area, increase rate)

    Normally, diffusion approaches to equilibrium. But in the case of drug absorption, drugs will be flushed away by circulation such that a steep concentration gradient is maintained
    
- Describe the principle of ion trapping.
    
    Most drugs are weak acids or weak bases, in their ionized form, they cannot cross the cell membrane, in their non-ionized form, they can pass through cell membrane
    
    - Ion trapping depends on pKa of a drug (strength) and the pH gradient across the two membrane:
    - For an weak acid drug in acid conditions, it will become non-ionized and can pass through the membrane
    - For a weak acid drug in alkali conditions, it will become ionized and cannot pass through the membrane
    - For a weak alkali drug in acidic conditions, it will become ionized and cannot pass through the membrane
    - For a weak alkali drug in alkali condition, it will become non-ionized and can pass throug the membrane
- Describe the properties of carrier-mediated transport of drugs. What are the two types of carrier-mediated transport of drugs?
    
    Carrier proteins or transporters are for transporting large drugs across the membrane
    
    The transporters are selective → Subjected to molecular shape of the drug
    
    The transporters are saturable → Further increase of drug concentration has no effect on rate of diffusion
    
    Active transport:
    
    - Requires energy
    - Movement against concentration gradient
    
    Facilitated Diffusion:
    
    - Does not require energy
    - Movement against concentration gradient
- What are the two major superfamilies of drug transporters?
    
    ATP binding cassete transporter - Active transport, efflux only
    
    Solute carrier transporter - facilitated transport, bidirectional
    
- Describe pinocytosis in drug transport.
    
    Involves invagination of the cell membrane and trapping drugs within a a pinosome
    

### Drug Absorption

- What is drug absorption?
    
    The process in which a drug leaves the site of administration into circulation
    
- What is bioavailability?
    
    Bioavailability indicates the fractional extent to which a dose of drug reaches the site of action or a biological fluid that has access to its site of action
    
- Why is bioavailability important?
    
    Drug response is related to the concentration of drug at the receptor site
    
    Hence, bioavailability of a drug often determines the therapeutic efficacy of a dosage form
    
- How is bioavailability evalulated?
    
    By definition, bioavailability involves the availability of dose of the drug at the site of action (the receptor site), but it is infeasible to measure concentration of drug at the site of action
    
    Hence, bioavailability is determined by the concentration of drug in blood or urine, assuming that it is at equilibrium with the the concentration of drug at site of action
    
- What are the factors affecting the bioavailability of a drug administered in solid oral dosage form?
    1. Degree of disintegration of the dosage form
    2. Degree of dissolution of the dosage form
    3. Extent of transfer of drug molecule across the membrane lining of the GI tract into systemic circulation
    4. First pass effect
- What is the first pass effect?
    
    First pass effect involves the elimination of drugs by metabolism between the site of administration and the site of sampling for measurement of bioavailability
    
    The major site of first pass metabolism is the liver due to portal vein circulation
    
    First pass effect is present anywhere with metabolic enzymes
    
- What are the factors affecting absorption of drugs in the GI tract?
    
    Physiochemical reactions:
    
    - Changes in GI pH ⇒ ion trapping
    - Chelation and exchange resin binding
    - Adsoprtion
    - Dissolution
    
    Changes in GI motility:
    
    Higher motility, lower absorption
    
    Lower motility, higher absorption
    
- What is bioequivalence?
    
    Chemical equivalence ⇒ Pharmaceutical equivalence ⇒ Bioequivalence
    
    Chemical equivalence: Equal doses of the same therapeutic (active) agent
    
    Pharmaceutical equivalence: Equal dosage of the same active ingredient, same dosage form, and same route of administration
    
    Chemically equivalent drugs are said to be bioequivalent when there is no considerabe variations in:
    
    1. Cmax - Maximum plasma concentration
    2. Tmax - Time to peak height concentration
    3. AUC - Total amount of drug absorbed

### Drug Distribution

- What is drug distribution?
    
    Drug distribution is the process in which drugs move from circulation into interstitial and intracellular fluids
    
- What are the factors determining the rate of delivery and potential amount of drug in tissue?
    
    Blood flow:
    
    Determines rate of delivery of drugs to tissue
    
    Affected by cardiac output, and regional blood flow
    
    Well perfused organs like the liver, kidney and brain have faster rate of delivery than visera, skin and fats
    
    Tissue volume:
    
    Determines potential amount of drug delivered to the tissue
    
    Also determines the rate of delivery - Concentration of the drug in the tissue remains low after uptake due to large volume, thus maintaining a steep concentration gradient
    
    Lipid solubility:
    
    Affects partitioning between blood and tissue
    
    Binding to plasma protein or tissue protein:
    
    Affects partitioning between blood and tissue as bound drugs cannot move from blood to interstitial fluids
    
- What are the different plasma proteins drugs bind to? What is the role of plasma protein in drug distribution?
    
    Acidic drugs bind to plasma albumin
    
    Basic drugs bind to alpha1-acid glycoprotein
    
    Binding of drugs to plasma protein limits the concentration in tissue and its locus of action, because only unbound drugs can move from vasculature into interstitial space
    
- What are the factors affecting fractions of bound drug in plasma?
    
    Drug concentration
    
    Affinity for binding site
    
    Dissociation constant
    
- Discuss tissue binding. What are the different tissues can drugs bind to?
    
    Drugs may bind to tissue rather than remaining in extracellular fluid or blood
    
    Good if it binds to target tissue, bad if it binds to other tissues
    
    1. Cellular components
        
        e.g. Protein, phospholipids
        
        Usually reversible
        
    2. Fats
        
        Lipid soluble drugs
        
    3. Bone
        
        e.g Tetracycline chelate to bones
        
        Toxic agent may accumulate in bones and cause destruction to bone medulla
        
- How may competition for protein binding results in drug interaction in form of drug displacement?
    
    There may be competition for binding with protein between two drugs
    
    There are two classes of drugs with high affinity to albumin:
    
    Class I - Clinical dose lower than binding capacity
    
    Class II - Clinical dose higher than binding capacity
    
    If Class II drug is taken after Class I drug, Class I drug may be displaced by Class II drug leading to a rapid increase in its free form 
    
- What are the consequences of drug displacement?
    
    Drug displacement causes an increase in concentration of free form drugs, resulting in increase in drug effect
    
    Drug  displacement may also result in decrease in duration of drug action as more drugs are available for elimination
