### Tibial nerve

The tibial nerve is formed from the anterior division of the anterior rami of L4 to S3.

Proximal to the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Popliteal fossa\|Popliteal fossa]], the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Sciatic nerve\|Sciatic nerve]] gives rise to the tibial nerve.

- ************************In the thigh************************
    
    The tibial nerve (or the tibial part of the sciatic nerve), provides motor innervation to all muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg, except for the short head of the biceps femoris.
    
- ****************In the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Popliteal fossa\|Popliteal fossa]]**
    
    The tibial nerve gives rise to the sural nerve, which leaves the popliteal fossa by descending along the surface of the gastronemius, which provides sensory innervation to the posterolateral side of the leg, and the lateral borders of the foot.
    
- ********************In the leg********************
    
    The tibial nerve leaves the popliteal fossa between the heads of the gastronemius, and passes through a tendinous arch formed by the two heads of the soleus. It descends the posterior compartment of the leg between the superficial and deep group of muscles, deep to the flexor digitorum longus.
    
    It accompanies the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior tibial artery\|Posterior tibial artery]].
    
    In the leg, the tibial nerve provides:
    
    - Motor innervation of the posterior compartment of the leg
- ************************In the ankle and foot************************
    
    The tibial nerve passes into the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tarsal tunnel\|Tarsal tunnel]], and wraps onto the plantar surface of the foot, where it branches into the medial plantar nerves and lataral plantar nerves.
    
    The medial and lateral plantar nerves provide:
    
    - Motor innervation of the plantar muscles of the foot
    - Sensory innervation to the soles of the foot.
    
    At the tarsal tunnel, the tibial nerve gives off a medial calcaneal nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the soles of the heel.
