### Acid-Base Balance

- **Buffer systems that defend blood pH and their location of action**
    - Chemical buffers
        - Bicarbonate buffer - important in ECF
        - Protein buffers - Important in ICF
        - Phosphate buffers - important in ICF
    - Respiratory system
    - Renal system
- **Difference in action of chemical buffer system and respiratory system and renal system in achieving acid-base balance**
    
    Chemical buffer system (mainly bicarbonate buffer system) - momentarily buffers pH in extracellular fluid, but unable to eliminate them from the body
    
    Respiratory system/renal system - able to eliminate acids from the body
    
- **Difference between role of respiratory system and renal system in acid-base homeostasis**
    
    Respiratory system can only remove volatile acids (i.e. CO2), whereas renal system can remove non-volatile acids by excretion of H+
    
    Only renal system can **remove alkaline substances** in the blood (excretion of HCO3-)
    
    Only renal system can **restore chemical buffers** for managing H+ level in extracellular fluids (by reabsorption and de novo synthesis of HCO3- from glutamine)
    

### Renal control of acid-base balance

- Acid-base balance in proximal tubules
    - Secretion of H+ and reabsorption of HCO3- in proximal tubules
        
        Keep in mind, for eavery H+ secreted, an HCO3- is reabsorbed and vice versa
        
        - **Source of H+ and HCO3- in tubular cells of proximal tubules**
            
            H2CO3 in tubular lumen is converted into H2O and CO2 by membrane-bounded-CA (CA-IV)
            
            H2O and CO2 enters tubular cells by osmosis and diffusion respectively
            
            Intracellular CA (CA-II) converts H2O and CO2 into H2CO3, which dissociates into H+ and HCO3-
            
        - **Mechanism of H+ secretion in proximal tubules**
            
            H+ secretion is achieved by primary and secondary active transport, mediated by 2 transporters on the apical membrane
            
            Na+/H+ exchange (NHE), which couples Na+ reabsorption down its gradient (generated by Na/K pump on basolateral membrane) and H+ secretion into the lumen
            
            H+-ATPase, which secrets H+ into the lumen at the expense of ATP
            
        - **Mechanism of HCO3- reabsorption in proximal tubules**
            
            Filtered HCO3- does not permeate readilily through the apical membrane of tubular cells, thus, HCO3- cannot be directly reabsorbed into tubular cells. Instead, filtered HCO3- is reabsorbed by interaction with H+ in the tubules (filtered or secreted)
            
            HCO3- combines with H+ in tubules, forming H2CO3
            
            H2CO3 is converted into H2O and CO2 by membrane-bounded CA, which enter the cell by osmosis and diffusion
            
            Intracellular CA converts H2O and CO2 into H2Co3, which dissociates into H+ and HCO3-
            
            Na+/HCO3- contransporter on basolateral membrane allows for reabsorption of HCO3- 
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Proportion of HCO3- reabsorbed in in proximal tubules**
            
            80%
            
    - Generation of new HCO3- in proximal tubules
        - **Mechanism of generation of new HCO3- in proximal tubules**
            
            Glutamine is reabsorbed from filtrate by sodium-amino acid co-transport. Glutamine is also uptake from the circulation via basolateral glutamine transport (SN1/SNAT3)
            
            In the cell, glutamine is converted into 2 bicarbonate ions and 2 ammnoium ions
            
            Ammonium ions is secreted into the lumen via NHE on apical membrane
            
            HCO3- is reabsorbed via Na+/HCO3- co-transporter on basolateral membrane

- Acid-base balance in collecting duct
    - **Cells of collecting duct responsible for acid-base balance**
        - Intercalated cells
            - Type A intercalated cells (IC-A)
                - **Transporters on membrane of IC-A and function**
                    
                    IC-A is responsible for H+ secretion (and HCO3- reabsorption)
                    
                    H+-ATPase and H+/K+ ATPase on apical membrane to secret H+ and NH4+ and reabsorb K+ (thus abundant mitochondria near apical surface)
                    
                    Anion-exchanger 1 on basolateral membrane to reabsorb HCO3-, in exchange for another anion
                    
                    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                    
                - **Mechanism of action of H+ primary active secretion and HCO3- reabsorption by IC-A**
                    
                    CO2 combines with H2O in IC-A to form H2CO3 under action of intracellular CA, and dissociates to give H+ and HCO3-
                    
                    H+ is secreted into the lumen by H+-ATPase and H+/K+-ATPase
                    
                    HCO3- is reabsorbed by anion-exchanger 1
                    
                    Note that similar to H+ secretion in proximal tubules, for each H+ secreted, a HCO3- is reabsorbed, except H+ secretion is carried out by only primary active transport 
                    
                    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                    
                - **Involvement of ammonia buffer system in tubules in secretion of H+ by IC-A**
                    
                    NH4+ in circulation enters IC-A via Na/K+ ATPase on basolateral membrane
                    
                    NH3 in IC-A can freely diffuse across the apical membrane into the collecting duct, or secreted via the Rhesus glycoprotein (Rhcg, ammonia-specific transporters)
                    
                    Luminal NH3 buffers H+, forming NH4+, maintaining low H+ concentration in lumen for efficient H+ secretion
                    
                    Efficient H+ secretion depends on the concomitant secretion of ammonia from IC-A
                    
                    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                    
            - Type B intercalated cells (IC-B)
                - **Transporters on membrane of IC-B and function**
                    
                    IC-B is responsible for HCO3- secretion (and H+ reabsorption)
                    
                    Pendrin (Cl-/HCO3-) exchanger on apical membrane exchanges luminal chloride for cellular bicarbonate (i.e. HCO3- secretion)
                    
                    H+-ATPase on basolateral membrane for reabsorption of H+
                    
                    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                    
                - **Mechanism of action of HCO3- secretion and H+ reabsorption by IC-B**
                    
                    CO2 combines with H2O in IC-B to form H2CO3 under action of intracellular CA, and dissociates to give H+ and HCO3-
                    
                    HCO3- is secreted via pendrin in exchange for luminal Cl- on apical membrane
                    
                    H+ is reabsorbed via H+-ATPase on basolateral membrane

### Dysregulation of acid-base equilibrium and renal correlations

- Metabolic acidosis
    - **Definition of metabolic acidosis**
        
        Acidosis due to an excessive accumulation of non-volatile acid, manifested as a primary reduction in plasma bicarbonate concentration
        
    - **Cause of metabolic acidosis**
        1. DM-induced ketoacidosis
        2. Hypoxia- or sepsis-induced lactic acidosis
        3. Severe diarrhea (loss of HCO3-)
        4. Renal failure
        5. Hyperkalemia
    - **How does hyperkalemia cause metabolic acidosis?**
        
        Hyperkalemia impedes secretion of NH3, such that urine H+ is not titrated, reducing the effectiveness of H+ secretion
        
    - **Symptoms of metabolic acidosis**
        1. Headache
        2. Rapid and shallow breathing (compensatory hyperventilation)
        3. Tachycardia/increase heart rate
        4. Fatigue
        5. Fruity breath (only for DM-induced ketoacidosis)
        6. Osteoporosis
- Metabolic alkalosis
    - **Definition of metabolic alkalosis**
        
        Alkalosis due to a rise of plasma HCO3- concentration
        
    - **Cause of metabolic alkalosis**
        1. Kidney failure
        2. Prolonged vomiting (loss of H+ in the stomach)
        3. Hyperaldosteronism (hypokalemia)
        4. Hypochloremia (reduced HCO3- secretion in IC-B)
    - **Symptoms of metabolic alkalosis**
        1. Headaches
        2. Compensatory hypoventilation
