### Acromioclavicular joint

The acromioclavicular joint is the joint between the acromion of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Scapulae\|Scapulae]] and the acromial end of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clavicle\|Clavicle]].

Articular disc is present within the joint cavity, but does not fully separate the entire joint cavity.

- **Classification of the acromioclavicular joint**
    
    The acromioclavicular joint is classified as a synovial plane joint.
    
- **Stabilization of the acromioclavicular joint**
    
    The joint capsule of the acromioclavicular joint is weak, and is stabilised by 2 ligaments:
    
    - The acromioclavicular ligament (intrinsic ligament) is a thickened part of the joint capsule of the acromioclavicular joint. It provides weak stabilization.
    - The conoid ligament (attaches superiorly to the conoid tubercle) and the trapezoid ligament (attaches superiorly to the trapezoid line) collectively forms the corococlavicular ligament, which attaches inferiorly to the coracoid process of the scapulae.

- **Functions of the acromioclavicular joint**
    
    The acromioclavicular joint connects the scapulae to the clavicle.
    
    It also provides mobility/flexibility of the scapulae with respect to the clavicle, enabling it to adjust to the shape/ curvature of the thoracic cage during the movement of the pectoral girdle.
