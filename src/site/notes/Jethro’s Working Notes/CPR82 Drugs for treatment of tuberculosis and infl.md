    - **Classification of Drug-resistant tuberculosis**
        
        Monoresistance - resistant to 1 drug
        
        Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) - resistant to at least isoniazid (H) and rifampicin (R)
        
        Extensive-drug resistant tuberculosis (EDR-TB) - MDR-TB + resistant to fluoroquinolones and resistant to one of the three injectable drugs, amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin
        
        Total-drug resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) - resistant to all drugs
        
- Primary anti-tuberculous drugs (1st line agent)
    - Isoniazid
        - **MOA of isoniazid**
            
            Isoniazid is a prodrug that is activated by catalase peroxidase
            
            Isoniazid inhibits enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), which is a component of the fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) complex
            
            FAS-II is required for synthesis of long chain mycolic acid, and thus isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis of mycobacterium

        - **Target mycobacterium population in tuberculosis lesion**
            
            Bactericidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular populations
            
            Bacteriostatic against dormant populations (in phagolysosomes of macrophages)
            
        - **Administrative route of isoniazid**
            
            IV route and oral route
            
        - **Pharmacokinetics of isoniazid**
            
            Metabolism:
            
            A prodrug activated by catalase peroxidase in mycobacterium
            
            Inactivated in the liver by N-acetyltransferase into acetyl-isoniazid
            
            Patients classified into slow acetylators and rapid acetylators, depending on acetylation rate/amount of N-acetyltransferase, which affects patients response to isoniazid
            
            Slow acetylators - more likely to accumulate to toxic concentrations with normal dose
            
            Rapid acetylators - requires unusually higher dose
            
        - **Adverse effects of isoniazid**
            
            GI disturbance - diarrhoea
            
            Risk of hepatotoxicity - hepatitis or elevated hepatic transferase
            
            Peripheral neuropathy (tingling feeling in hands and feet) - due to competition of metabolism with pyridoxine (treated with pyrodoxine, i.e. vitamin B6)
            
    - Rifampicin
        - **MOA of rifampicin**
            
            Directly bind to beta subunit of RNA polymerase
            
            This results in inhibition of transcription of mRNA, thus inhibiting protein synthesis

        - **Target mycobacterium population in tuberculosis lesion**
            
            Targets actively metabolising intracellular and extracellular mycobacterium
            
        - **Administration route of rifampicin**
            
            IV route, oral route
            
        - **Adverse effects of rifampicin**
            
            Harmless red-orange discoloration of body secretions
            
            GI disturbance
            
            Skin rash
            
            Hepatotoxicity - hepatitis
            
            Strong inducer of CYP3A drug metabolising enzymes - reduce plasma levels of other drugs
            
        - Rifabutin
            - **What is rifabutin?**
                
                Derivative of rifampicin, with long serum half-life (45 hours)
                
                Induces drug metabolising enzymes to a lesser extent that rifampicin
                
            - **Adverse effects of rifampicin**
                
                Similar to that of rifampicin:
                
                Harmless red-orange discoloration of body secretions
                
                GI disturbance
                
                Skin rash
                
                Hepatotoxicity - hepatitis
                
                Less drug interactions
                
    - Ethambutol
        - **MOA of ethambutol**
            
            Ethambutol inhibits arabinose transferase (EmbB), thus inhibiting synthesis of arabinogalactin
            
            Arabinogalactin is an essential component of mycobacterium cell wall, thus ethambutol inhibits cell wall synthesis

        - **Target mycobacterium population in tuberculosis lesion**
            
            Actively metabolising intracellular and extracellular mycobacterium
            
        - **Adverse effects of ethambutol**
            
            Optic neuritis (an inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the optic nerve) - diminished visual acuity
            
            Not recommended for children (<5 years old) as it is difficult to monitor visual acuity
            
    - Pyrazinamide
        - **MOA of pyrazinamide**
            
            Pyrazinamide is a prodrug which is activated into pyrazinoic acid by pyrazinamidase
            
            Pyrazinoic acid binds to fatty acid synthase I (FAS-I), thus inhibiting synthesis of short chain mycolic acid, therefore inhibiting cell wall synthesis

    - Streptomycin
        - **MOA of streptomycin**
            
            Streptomycin binds to 30S subunit of ribosome
            
            This causes codon misreading, and inhibits protein synthesis

- Normal anti-tuberculosis regimen in Hong Kong
    
    **TB and chest service of department of health provides treatment free of charge**
    
    Usual course of treatment lasts at least 6 months:
    
    4 drug Rx for first 2 months - Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol/streptomycin
    
    2 drug Rx for subsequent 4 months - isoniazid, rifampicin
    
    **Drugs either taken daily or 3 times a week, taken under direct observation therapy (DOT) at chest clinic**
    
- MDR-TB regimen
    
    5-6 drug Rx, individualized according to susceptibility test, with at least 4 drugs to which the organism is susceptible
    
    **Much longer Rx** - 1-2 years after culture is negative
    
    **Daily administration and strict compliance is a must for MDR-TB**
    

### Drugs for treatment of influenza

- **Influenza replication cycle**
    1. Attachment - Hemagglutinin binds to sialic acid-containing receptors in the apical membrane of host cells
    2. Entry/Penetration - Endocytosis of viral particle
    3. Uncoating - M2 channels open to enable the influx of H+ ions into the viral particle, which causes the acidification of the viral coat, causing the release of viral genome
    4. RNA replication - Influx of H+ via M2 channels also causes the acidification of viral core, which activates reverse transcriptase for RNA replication
    5. Viral protein synthesis - translation of influenza viral protein
    6. Viral assembly - assembly of nucleoplasmid, and transfer of glycoproteins to host cell membrane which acts as the envelope
    7. Budding - Neuramidase cleaves the binding between haemagglutinin with sialic acid-containing receptors to facilitate release and spread of viral particles

    - **MOA of adamatanes**
        
        Adamatanes block M2 proteins, thus inhibiting the influx of H+ into the virus
        
        This prevents the acidification of viral capsid, preventing viral uncoating
        
        This also prevents the acidification of viral core, which is required for activation of RNA transcriptase, thus inhibiting viral replication
        
    - **Clinical use of adamatanes**
        
        For prevention and treatment of Influenza A infection only
        
        Should be given within 48 hours after contact
        
        No longer first line treatment due to resistance
        
    - **Adverse effects of adamatanes**
        
        GI disturbance
        
        Dizziness
        
        Ataxia
        
        Slurred speech
        
- Neuramidase inhibitors
    - **Clinical use of neuramidase inhibitors**
        
        Effective against Influenza A and B infections
        
        Most effective when given the first 24 hours after contact
        
        5 day therapy
        
    - **MOA of neuramidase inhibitors**
        
        Neuramidase inhibitors bind to and inhibit neuramidase of new viral particles
        
        This inhibits neuramidase from cleavage of the binding between haemagglutinin and sialic acid-containing receptors
        
        This prevents release of progeny virions
