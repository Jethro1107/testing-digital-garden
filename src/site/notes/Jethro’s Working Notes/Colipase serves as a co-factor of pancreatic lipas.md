### Colipase serves as a co-factor of pancreatic lipase

Colipase is released in pancreatic juice as a procolipase, which is converted into its active form by trypsin.

- **Despite increasing the surface area for pancreatic lipase to act on, emulsification of lipids pose a problem for pancreatic lipase to act on:**
    
    Pancreatic lipase are displaced by the bile salts from the lipid-water interface of the emulsified lipid droplet. This prevents pancreatic lipase from hydrolysing triglycerides into  monoglycerides and fatty acids.
    
    This problem is solved by **colipase**.
    
- **Functions of colipase**
    
    Colipase displaces bile salts, enabling the pancreatic lipase to engage with the lipids in the lipid droplet.
    
    Colipase also enables the catalytic site of pancreatic lipase to adopt its active conformation.
