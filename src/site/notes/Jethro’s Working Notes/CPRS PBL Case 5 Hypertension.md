### LO I.2: Chronic hypertension is associated with a host of complications

Complications of Hypertension:

1. Aneurysms
2. CKD
3. MI
4. Stroke
5. Heart failure

### LO II.1: Main principles of assessment for a patient presenting with hypertension

Assessment for patients presenting with hypertension involves a series of steps:

1. Confirm hypertension
    
    Hypertension is diagnosed through elevated blood pressure (according to JNC-7 criteria) in 3 separate occasions (based on average of 2 or more readings in â‰¥ 2 follow up visits after the initial screening.
    
2. Determine extent on end organ damage
    
    Heart: LV hypertrophy, IHD, heart failure
    
    Retinopathy (fundoscopy)
    
    CKD
    
    Brain
    
3. Determine cardiovascular risks
4. Exclusion of secondary hypertension

### LO II.3: Signs of chronic hypertension

Usually asymptomatic until it results in end organ damage (heart, vessels, eyes, brain, kidneys)

Eyes - hypertensive retinopathy

Arterio-venous nipping - arteriole crosses a vein, as a result of high blood pressure, it compresses on the vein

Silver wiring - Occluded arterioles look white

Retinal haemorrhage

Cloudy spots

CVS examination - Left ventricular hypertrophy

Deviated Apex beat

Kidney functions - Hypertensive nephropathy

Proteinuria

Microalbuminuria

Glucosuria
