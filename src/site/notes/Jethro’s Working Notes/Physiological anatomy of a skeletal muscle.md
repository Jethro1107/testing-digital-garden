### Physiological anatomy of a skeletal muscle

The muscle fibres of a skeletal muscle is separated into outer extrafusal muscle fibres, and an inner intrafusal muscle fibres.

************************************************Extrafusal muscle fibres************************************************

Extrafusal muscle fibres are contractile, and are innervated by ******alpha motor neurons******.

**********************************************************************************Intrafusal muscle fibres (muscle spindle)**********************************************************************************

Intrafusal muscle fibres consist of a central portion, and its two ends.

The central portion lacks sarcomere, and is hence non-contractile ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Sarcomere is the basic unit of a myofibril\|Sarcomere is the basic unit of a myofibril]]). It serves as a receptor that detects the length of the muscle (or at least the length of the central portion), and is innervated by Ia sensory nerve fibres and II nerve fibres.

- The central portion of intrafusal muscle fibre serves as a receptor that detects stretch, and can be activated when:
    - Stretch of the entire muscle (changes in muscle length), will result in stretch of the central portion of the intrafusal muscle fibres, which excites the receptor.
    - Even without a change in the length of the entire muscle, contraction of the two ends of intrafusal muscle fibre will stretch the central portion of the intrafusal muscle fibre, which excites the receptor.

The two ends of intrafusal muscle fibres are contractile, and are innervated by *gamma motor neurons*.
