### Drugs used for management of heart failure

- Drugs used for management of acute heart failure
    
    Positive inotropic drugs:
    
    Beta-adrenergic receptor stimulants
    
    Phosphodiesterase inhibitors
    
    Cardiac glycosides
    
    Calcium sensitizers
    
- Drugs used for management of chronic heart failure
    
    Diuretics
    
    Vasodilators
    
    Angiotensin inhibitors
    
    Beta blockers
    

### Positve inotropic drugs

- Beta-adrenergic receptor stimulants
    - **Examples of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulants**
        
        Dobutamine, Dopamine
        
    - **MOA of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulants in acute heart failure**
        
        Beta-adrenergic receptor stimulants stimulate beta-1 receptor on the heart
        
        This activates adenyl cyclase, causing an increase in cAMP levels
        
        cAMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylate L-type Ca2+ channel, phosphalamban and ryanodine channel, which results in increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration
        
        This results in positive inotropic effects

        Cf: [[  Mechanisms of sympathetic effects on inotropy  \|  Mechanisms of sympathetic effects on inotropy  ]](sympathetic stimulation and inotropy)
        
    - **MOA of dobutamine**
        
        Affinity of dobutamine: Beta-1 > beta-2 > alpha-1
        
        Pharmacological effects of dobutamine is enantiomer-selective:
        
        (-) enantiomer - an agonist of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (vasoconstriction)
        
        (+) enantiomer - a partial agonist of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (vasodilation)
        
        Both are non-selective agonist of beta adrenergic receptors (beta-1 and beta-2)
        
        Effects on contractility of the heart:
        
        Due to stimulation of beta-1 adrenergic receptor, it results in positive inotropic effects of the heart
        
        Effects on total peripheral resistance:
        
        Effects of (-) enantiomer and (+) enantiomer offset each other, such that there is no effect on alpha-1 stimulation
        
        Stimulation of beta-2 receptors causes vasodilation
        
        Therefore there is decreased total peripheral resistance, resulting in decreased blood pressure, decreased afterload and hence raised cardiac output
        
        Cf: [[First aid  Sympathomimetics - Dobutamine\|First aid  Sympathomimetics - Dobutamine]], [[Sketchy pharmacology  Sympathomimetics\|Sketchy pharmacology  Sympathomimetics]] 
        
    - **MOA of dopamine**
        
        Affinity of dopamine: D1 (coupled with Gs) > D2 (Coupled with Gi) > Beta-1 > alpha-1
        
        Pharmacological effect is concentration-dependent:
        
        - Low doses (â‰¤ 2 micrograms/kg/min):
            
            Binds to D1 receptors (in VSMC), resulting in increased cAMP levels
            
            This results in vasodilation
            
            Binds to D2 receptors, which reduces norepinephrine release by sympathetic nerves, causing reduced alpha-1 mediated vasoconstriction (especially in renal and splanchnic vasculature)
            
            This results in vasodilation
            
            Therefore there is decreased total peripheral resistance, resulting in decreased blood pressure, decreased afterload and hence raised cardiac output
            
        - Intermediate dose (2-5 micrograms/kg/min):
            
            Binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptor, causing increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations
            
            This results in positive inotropy
            
        - High dose (5-15 micrograms/kg/min):
            
            Binds to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing peripheral arterial and venous vasoconstriction
            
            This results in increased total peripheral resistance, resulting in increased blood pressure, increased afterload and hence decreased cardiac output
            
    - **Limitations of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulants**
        
        Tachyphylaxis (reduced efficacy after 4 days)
        
        Addition or substitution with PDE3 inhibitors required
        
        Clinical effect blunted by concomitant use of beta-blockers
        
    - **Adverse effects of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulants**
        
        Pro-arrhythmia - Due to increased intracellular levels, increasing risk of DAD
        
        Pro-angina - Due to increased contractility and heart rate, causing increased myocardial demand
        
- Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors
    - **Examples of phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors as positive inotropic drug**
        
        Milrinone, enoximone
        
    - **MOA of phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors in acute heart failure**
        
        Inhibits breakdown of cAMP by phosphodiesterase 3 in cardiomyocytes, causing increased levels of cAMP
        
        cAMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylate L-type Ca2+ channel, phosphalamban and ryanodine channel, which results in increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration
        
        This results in positive inotropic effects

        Inhibit Na+/K+ exchange pump:
        
        This reverses the action of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, causing it to pump out Na+ in exchange for extracellular Ca2+ (move in Ca2+)
        
        This results in increased sequesteration of Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus increased subsequent Ca2+ release via Ryanodine receptor
        
        This results in increased Ca2+ concentration, resulting in positive inotropy

        Results in intracellular Ca2+ overload, increasing risk of delayed after depolarization
        
        GI disturbance
        
        CNS disturbance
        
        Narrow safety margin
        
    - **Limitations of cardiac glycosides**
        
        Action opposed by hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia
        
        Narrow safety margin - thus not first line therapy
        
- Calcium sensitizers
    - **Example of calcium sensitizers**
        
        Levosimendan
        
    - **MOA of calcium sensitizers as a positive inotropic drug**
        
        Increase the affinity of TnC to Ca2+, thus strengthening the bind between TnC and Ca2+ and increasing Ca2+ sensitivity
        
        This results in increased contractility without increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels (mitigate proarrhythmic effects)
        
        Note: Kind of like the molecular mechanism of preload (Cf: [[  Molecular events of effects of preload on stroke volume  \|  Molecular events of effects of preload on stroke volume  ]])
        
    - **Other effects of Calcium sensitizers**
        
        Levosimendan also activates K+ on VSMC:
        
        This results in hyperpolerization of VSMC, preventing the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels and thus reducing Ca2+ influx
        
        This results in relaxation of VSMC and thus systemic and coronary vasodilation
        
    - **Adverse effects of calcium sensitizers**
        
        Hypotension - Headaches
        
    - **Contraindications of calcium sensitizers**
        
        Low blood pressure at baseline is associated with increased mortality with use of levosimendan

### Management of chronic heart failure

- What is the culprit of chronic heart failure? [Edit [[Edit Later\|Edit Later]]
    
    Compensatory mechanisms to restore cardiac output
    
    Increased sympathetic activity will cause vasoconstriction, which increases total peripheral resistance and blood pressure, causing increased afterload
    
    Activation of RAAS will trigger vasoconstriction and fluid retention, which increases blood pressure, causing increased afterload
    
    This will result in increased cardiac workload and myocardial hypertrophy, causing progression of heat failure
    
- **Drugs used in management of chronic heart failure and its rationale**
    
    To counteract compensatory mechanisms preventing the adverse effect of further spiralling of chronic heart failure
    
    - Diuretics
    - Vasodilators
    - Angiotensin inhibitors
    - Beta-blockers
    - **Newer heart failure drugs**
        - Ivabradine
        - LCZ696
            - **What is LCZ696?**
                
                A combination of valsartan (ARB) and sacubitril (Niprilysin inhibitor) in a 1:1 ratio
                
            - **Composition of LCZ696**
                - Valsartan
                    - **MOA of valsartan in management of chronic heart failure**
                        
                        Blocks angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R), which:
                        
                        Prevents vasoconstriction, causing reduced total peripheral resistance and blood pressure, reducing afterload
                        
                        Reduces tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water, promoting diuresis and natriuresis
                        
                        This reduces cardiac workload and thus prevents ventricular remodelling and progression of heart failure
                        
                - Sacubitril
                    - **Function of niprilysin in chronic heart failure**
                        
                        An endopeptidase that is involved in the breakdown of vasoactive peptides, e.g. ANP/BNP, bradykinin, adrenomedullin, AngI and II, and substance P (which are mostly vasodilators) into inactive metabolites
                        
                        Vasoactive peptides are often upregulated in chronic heart failure to serve as a counterregulatory mechanism to oppose the compensatory mechanisms (i.e. activation of RAAS)

                    - **MOA of Sacubitril in management of chronic heart failure**
                        
                        Sacubitril inhibits niprilysin:
                        
                        This prevents the breakdown of vasodilators, resulting in increased vasodilation
                        
                        The inhibitor of natriuretic peptides also reduces reabsorption of Na+ and water, promoting diuresis and natriuresis, preventing volume overload and ventricular remodelling
                        
                - **Synergy of MOA of valsartan and sacubitril**
                    
                    LCZ696 is an angiotensin receptor niprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)
                    
                    Sacubitril inhibits neprilysin, preventing the breakdown of vasodilators such as natriuretic peptide, bradykinin and substance P, causing vasodilation
                    
                    However, neprilysin inhibitors breakdown of angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor
                    
                    Hence, valsartan (an ARB) inhibits the effect of angiotensin II
                    
            - **Adverse effect of LCZ696**
                
                Hypotension
                
                Angiooedema - due to elevated bradykinin and substance P
                
                Adverse effects of ARBs:
                
                Hyperkalemia
                
                Acute renal failure
                
                Increased risk of fetal hypotension, renal failure or malformation - contraindicated in pregnancy
                
                Cf: [[  Adverse effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs  \|  Adverse effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs  ]] 
                
            - **Precautions of LCZ696**
                1. Discontinue ACE inhibitors 36 hours before starting LCZ696
                    
                    To minimize angioedema
                    
                2. Check and correct Na+ and volume depletion states before starting LCZ696
                    
                    To minimize hypotension
