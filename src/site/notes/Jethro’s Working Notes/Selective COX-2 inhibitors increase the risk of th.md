### Selective COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of thrombosis
In the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Normal homeostasis of hemostasis\|Normal homeostasis of hemostasis]], whether platelet aggregation occurs to form a primary thrombus depends on:
- Vasodilation, mediated by prostacyclin produced by endothelial cells (COX-1 and COX-2 dependent)
- Activation of GpIIb/IIIa complex, mediated by thromboxane A2 produced by platelets (COX-1 dependent only)

However, in the use of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Selective COX-2 inhibitors\|Selective COX-2 inhibitors]], Platelet aggregation is not inhibited, as COX-2 is not inducible in anuclear platelets. On the otherhand, vasodilation is inhibited due to inhibition of prostacyclin production by endothelial cells. 

This predisposes to platelet aggregation and thrombosis.
