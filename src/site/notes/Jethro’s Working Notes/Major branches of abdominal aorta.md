### Origin and bifurcation of abdominal aorta

As the thoracic aorta descends through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm (T12), it becomes the abdominal aorta, which bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries at L4.

### Major branches of abdominal aorta

The abdominal branch consist of 3 unpaired anterior branches, 4 paired lateral branches and 4 paired posterior branches:

3 unpaired anterior branch - celiac trunk ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/The celiac trunk gives rise to 3 branches\|The celiac trunk gives rise to 3 branches]]) , superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery (These branches provides the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera\|Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera]])

4 paired lateral branches - inferior phrenic arteries, middle suprarenal arteries, renal arteries and gonadal arteries

4 paired posterior branches - 4 paired lumbar arteries
