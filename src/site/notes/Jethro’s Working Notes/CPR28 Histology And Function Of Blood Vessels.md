            - **Histological features of tunica intima**
                - Simple squamous endothelium and underlying basal laminae - continuous from endocardium to capilalries
                - Subendothelial layers - loose connective tissue occasionally with smooth muscle cells
                - Internal elastic membrane - a lamellae of fenestrated elasic material allowing substances to diffuse through the layer, between tunica intima and tunica media, only present in arteries and arterioles
        - Tunica media
            - **What is tunica media?**

        - **Effects of atherosclerosis on vascular wall**
            - Thickened tunica intima
    - Comparison between arteries and veins
        - Arteries experience pressure waves of blood flow while veins do not
        - Arteries have thicker walls than veins to resist higher pressure
        - Arteries have thicker layer of tunica media than veins
        - Arteries have a more uniform circular shape than veins, which have a floppy appearance
        - Arteries have a smaller lumen than veins
- Histology of arteries
    - **4 types of arteries by size**
        - Large/elastic arteries

                - Aorta and aortic trunk and their branches, i.e. brachiocehphalic trunk, common carotid, subclavian, pulmonary arteries, common iliac arteries
            - **Properties and function of elastic arteries**
                - Elastic arteries serve as conduction arteries, facilitating continuous and uniform blood flow to arterial system during systole and diastole
                - The walls of elastic arteries are rich in elastic material (multiple sheets of elastic lamellae), allowing them to distend during systole and recoil during diastole to maintain a continuous blood flow and blood pressure (Windkessel effect)
            - **Properties of tunica intima of elastic arteries**
                - Relatively thick
                - Thick subendothelial layer consisting of collagen, elastic fibres and smooth muscles
                - Internal elastic membrane is inconspicuous because tunica media consist of many layers of elastic lamellae
            - **Properties of tunica media of elastic arteries**
                - Thickest of the three layers
                - Multiple layers of circumferentially located smooth muscles with fenestrated elastic lamellae in between, where aorta has 40-70 layers of fenestrated elastic lamellae
                - Fibroblasts are not present
                - External elastic membrane is inconspicuous due to many layers of elastic lamellae nearby

            - **Properties and function of medium arteries**
                - Regulate blood flow and blood pressure via vasoconstriction and vasodilation
                - Hence, medium arteries then to have more smooth muscles and less elastin the elastic arteries
                - As a result of fewer elastic lamellae, the internal and external elastic membrane is visible (only type of artery with both visible)
            - **Properties of tunica intima in medium arteries**
                - Thinner than that in large arteries
                - Prominent internal elastic membrane as there are few elastic lamellae in tunica media
                - Thickness may increase with age due to lipid deposit
            - **Properties of tunica media in medium arteries**
                - Consist of mainly circumferentially oriented vascular smooth muscle cells amidst collagen fibre, with very few elastic fibre
                - Fibroblasts are not present
                - External elastic membrane is prominent as there are little elastic material in tunica media
            - **Properties of tunica adventitia in medium arteries**
                - Relatively thicker
                - Connective tissue containing fibroblast, collagen, elastic fibres, adipose cells etc.
                - Blood vessels and nerves
        - Small arteries and arterioles
            - **Distinguishing between small arteries and arterioles**
                - By number of layers of smooth muscles in tunica media:
                    - Small arteries have 3-8 layers of smooth muscle
                    - Arterioles have 1-2 layers of smooth muscle
            - **Properties of vascular wall in small arteries and arterioles**
                - Internal and external elastic membrane become less and less defined, where the latter is not present in arterioles
                - Tunica adventitia blends in with surrounding connective tissue
            - **Function of arterioles**
                - Regulate blood flow to capillary beds by contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles

- Histology of capillaries
    - **What are capillaries and their function?**
        - Smallest diameter blood vessels, often smaller than the diameter of a red blood cell
        - Form a capillary bed connecting arterioles and venules

    - **Structure of capillaries**
        - A single layer of endothelial cells covered by basal laminae
    - Cells of capillaries
        - Endothelial cells
        - **Pericyte and function**
            - Cells forming branched cellular processes wrapping around capillary endothelial cells, enclosed within the basement membrane
            - Provide vascular support and promote stability of the capillaries
            - Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that can differentiate into endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells
    - **Types of capillaries**
        - Continuous capillaries
            - **Structure and permeability of continuous capillaries**
                - Made of continous basal laminae and complete endothelial cells
                - Quite restrictive, only allowing passage of small molecules to pass between adjacent endothelial cells (intercellular clefts)
                - Larger molecules must be transported by pinocytosis

                - Fenstrations may be covered by a non-membranous diaphragm, but not in kidneys
                - Thickness of walls and number of fenestrations change in with functional state (in GI tract)
                - Fenestrated capillaries are permeable to a wider range of material than continuous capillaries
            - **Examples of continuous capillaries**
                - Capillaries in endocrine glands or involved in exchange of fluid and metabolite, e.g. kidneys, pancreas, GI tract

                - Larger diameter and irregularly shaped
                - Made of discontinuous (or missing) basal laminae and incomplete endothelial cells (large pores)
                - Kupfer cells and Ito cells are associated with capillary endothelial cells in the liver
