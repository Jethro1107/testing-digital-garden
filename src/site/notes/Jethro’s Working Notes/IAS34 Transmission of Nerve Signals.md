### Events in the propagation of an Action Potential

- What is action potential and its relations to graded potentials?
    
    Action potential - Propagated changes in transmembrane potential which affects the entire excitable membrane, produced by graded potential
    
- Describe the process resulting in action potential generation.
    1. Depolarization to threshold - Local current strong enough to depolarize adjacent portions of plasma membrane to open voltage-gated sodium channels
    2. Activation of sodium channels and rapid depolarization - Sodium ions rush in the cell, changing the transmembrane potential from negative to positive (+40mV)
    3. Inactivation of Sodium channels and Activation of potassium channels - Inactivation gate of Na channel closes (Na channel inactivation), while K channels open. K leaves the cell, allowing for repolarization to occur
    4. Closing of Potassium Channels - K channels start to close at -70mV and finish closing at -90 mV (overshoot), but transmembrane potential returns to resting potential and action potential ends
- Describe the 4 phases of an action potential. Illustrate with a graph plotting Membrane potential against time.
    1. Resting state - All voltage gated ion channels are closed, membrane sits at resting potential
    2. Depolarizing phase - Local current from graded potential depolarize plasma membrane by around 20mV, opening activation gate of Na channels, causing Na to rush into the cell, allowing for rapid depolarization to +40mV
    3. Repolarizing phase - Inactivation gate of Na channels close, while K channels open. K enters the cell, allowing for repolarization to occur
    4. Hyperpolarizing phase - K channels take time to close, such that the resulting membrane potential is usually lower than resting potential
- Describe the process of signal propagation along Axon.
    
    Na ions entering spreads to the next node, resulting a graded depolarization of the next node to threshold to generate an action potential
    
- Why can action potential only move in one direction only?
    
    When inactivation gate of Na channels close, Na channel remains inactivated and cannot open again by depolarization to threshold until membrane potential returns to resting potential first
    
    Refractory period - The period of time in which the Na channel remains inactivated and cannot be open again by depolarization

### Factors Affecting the Speed of Signal Propagation

- Which two neuroglia are responsible for myelination of axon?
    
    Oligodendrocytes and Shwann cells
    
- Where is oligodendrocytes located?
    
    Central nervous system
    
- What is the function of oligodendrocytes?
    
    One oligodendrocyte myelinates segments of several axons
    
    Oligodendrocyte forms long cytoplasmic extensions, which comes in contact with axons and myelinate them
    
- Where is Schwann cells located?
    
    Peripheral nervous system
    
- What is the function of Schwann cells?
    
    One Shwann cell myelinates one segment of one axon
    
    Wraps around axon and rotates to give several layers of myelin
    
- Describe the process and advantage of saltatory conduction.
    
    Action potential in initial segment generated, Na+ entering spreads to the first node during depolarizing phase, resulting in graded depolarization of the first node to threshold, generating an action potential in the first node
    
    Na+ entering in first node during depolarizing phase, resulting in graded depolarization of the second node to threshold, generating an action potential in the second node
    
    Advantages:
    
    Action potential jump from node to node, skipping the unmyelinated internodes, thus increasing rate of conduction of action potentials compared to continuous conduction
    
    Ref: [[Guyton and Hall Chapter 5  Saltatory Conduction in myenlinated fibres from node to node\|Guyton and Hall Chapter 5  Saltatory Conduction in myenlinated fibres from node to node]] 
    
- Describe the relationship of axon diameter and action potential speed.
    
    The larger the diameter, the lower the resistance, the faster the speed
    
    The most important information (vision, balance, motor commands) is carried by large-diameter, myelinated axons
