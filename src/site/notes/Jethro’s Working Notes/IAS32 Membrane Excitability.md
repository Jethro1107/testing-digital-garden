### Resting Membrane Potential

- What is the resting membrane potential?
    
    The resting membrane potential is the electrical potential of the cell's interior relative to its surroundings in a resting state
    
    Resting potential is the transmembrane potential difference of a resting cell due to the uneven electrical charge difference due to uneven distribution of ions
    
    Inside of the cell is more negative than outside of the cell
    
- What are the two forces in place to maintain the resting membrane potential?
    
    Passive force (via channels) and active force (via exchange pump)
    
- Describe the concentration gradient of Na+, K+ and Cl-.
    
    Na+ is more concentrated outside the cell than inside the cell
    
    K+ is more concentrated inside the cell than outside the cell
    
    Cl- is *more concentrated outside* the cell than inside the cell
    
- Describe the electrochemical gradient using K+ as an example.
    
    Chemical gradient - The force that cause K+ to move out the cell down the concentration gradient
    
    Electrical gradient - The force that cause K+ to remain in the cell as the inside of the cell is relatively negative
    
    When the chemical gradient and electrical gradient is balanced, equilibrium is established
    
- Describe the active forces in play to maintain the resting membrane potential.
    
    Na-K exchange pump powered by ATP
    
    Carries 3 Na+ out and 2 K+ in at the expense of 1 ATP to counteract diffusion force of Na+ and K+ to maintain the resting potential
    

### Graded Potentials

- What are the three different classes of gated ion channels?
    
    Ligand/Chemical-gated ion channels - open in the presence of ligands
    
    Voltage-gated ion channels - open in response to changes in transmembrane potential,  present in excitable membranes as they are responsible for generating action potential
    
    Mechanically-gated ion channels - open in response to the physical distortion of membrane surfaces, present in mechanoreceptors
    
- What is the resting potential of a typical neuron?
    
    -65 to -70mV
    
- How is a graded potential generated?
    
    ligand binds to ligand-gated sodium channels on the post synaptic membrane
    
    Na+ enters the cell down its concentration gradient, thus depolarizing the membrane
    
    Spread of Na+ in the cell depolarizes adjacent portion of the plasma membrane
    
    Degree of depolarization decreases with distance from site of stimulation, so the depolarizing effect is only local
    

### Excitatory and Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials

- What channels cause depolarization?
    
    Na+ channels 
    
- What channels cause hyperpolarization?
    
    K+ channels (K+ leaves the cell) and Cl- channels (Cl- enters the cell)
    
- What happens when stimulus is removed?
    
    Repolarization occurs, allowing transmembrane potential to return to resting potential
    
- How does excitatory neurotransmitters generate excitatory postsynaptic potential?
    
    Excitatory neurotransmitters stimulate depolarization of the membrane, bringing it closer to the threshold for generation of active potential
    
    This potential change is called excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)
    
- How does inhibitory neurotransmitters generate inhibitory post synaptic potential?
    
    Inhibitory neurotransmitters stimulate hyperpolarization of the membrane, decreasing the likelihood of generation of active potential
    
    This potential change is called inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)
    
- How do EPSP and IPSP interact?
    
    Interactions of EPSP and IPSP determine changes in transmembrane potential
    
    If they are of equal size, the transmembrane potential remains at resting level
    
- What is the difference between a graded potential and action potential?
