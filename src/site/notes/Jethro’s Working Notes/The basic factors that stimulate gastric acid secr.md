### The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine

- **Acetylcholine**
    
    Acetylcholine is released by the postganglionic muscarinic neurons in the submucosal plexus of the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]].
    
    Acetylcholine stimulates M3 receptors on parietal cells, where it stimulates Gq protein, causing it to dissociate into the alpha subunit and the beta-gamma subunit. The alpha subunit activates phospholipase C (PLC), which results in production of IP3.
    
    IP3 stimulates the release of Ca2+ by the cytoplasmic reticulum, resulting in an increasing Ca2+ levels.
    
    Increased Ca2+ levels causes activation of protein kinase C.
    
    Eventually, this results in the shuttling of tubulovesicles into the apical secretory canaliculi, enabling [[Hydrochloric acid secretion by parietal cells is driven by an ionic mechanism\|Hydrochloric acid secretion by parietal cells is driven by an ionic mechanism]].
    
    Acetylcholine also stimulates enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells to release [[histamine\|histamine]].
    
- **Histamine**
    
    Histamine (synthesised from amino acid *histidine* via enzyme *histidine decarboxylase*) is released by enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells.
    
    Histamine stimulates H2 receptors on parietal cells, where it stimulates Gs protein.
    
    The alpha subunit of Gs protein stimulates adenyl cyclase (AC), resulting in increased cAMP production.
    
    Increased cAMP levels activates protein kinase A.
    
    Eventually, this results in shuttling of tubulovesicles into the apical secretory canaliculi, enabling hydrochloric acid secretion.
    
- **Gastrin**
    
    Gastrin is released by G cells in the pyloric glands (in the pylorus/ antrum of the stomach).
    
    **Gastrin mediates its effects via an endocrine mechanism** (gastrin is released into circulation), rather via local diffusion from the pylorus to the body (paracrine mechanisms.
    
    Gastrin stimulates acid secretion by parietal cells two ways, directly and indirectly:
    
    - Gastrin stimulates cholecystokinin 2 (CCK2) receptors on parietal cells. This results in an increase in intracellular Ca2+ level. This results in acid secretion by parietal cells.
    - Gastrin also stimulates CCK2 receptors on ECL cells. This results in increased histamine secretion by ECL cells, which results in increased acid secretion by parietal cells. This mechanism is called the **gastrin-histamine stimulation**.
