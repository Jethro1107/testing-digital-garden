### General Architecture of the Nervous System

- What is the function of the nervous system?
    
    System that receives, processes, integrates and responds to information, enabling perception and cognition
    
    The nervous system controls the activities of somatic and visceral systems
    
- How is the nervous system divided anatomically?
    
    Central nervous system - Consist of the brain and the spinal cord, the optic nerve is also a component of the nervous system
    
    Peripheral nervous system -Consists of nerve fibres and nerve ganglia outside the CNS and special nerve endings, acting as the relay station between the CNS and the rest of the body
    
- How is the nervous system divided functionally?
    
    Somatic nervous system - Involved in voluntary, conscious control of the body, providing innervation to all parts of the body except internal organs, cardiac and smooth muscles
    
    Automatic nervous system - Involved in involuntary control of the body, providing innervations to internal organs (sensory), cardiac and smooth muscles (motor)
    
- Which two cell types are the basic unit of the nervous system?
    
    Neurons - structural and functional unit, cannot divide
    
    Glia - supporting cells, can divide
    
- What is present in the CNS?
    
    Grey matter - Neuron cell bodies, neuropil, glial cells and capillaries for synaptic integration, information process, motor control and sensory perception
    
    White matter - myelinated axons and glial cells for transmitting signals
    
- What is present in the PNS?
    
    Ganglia - Collections of soma outside the CNS together with their supporting cells
    
    Nerves - Bundles of myelinated and/or unmyelinated axons with their supporting cells for transmitting signals
    
- Describe the level of organization of a nerve fibre.
    
    Axons myelinated by Shwann cells
    
    Each axon is surrounded by endoneurium
    
    Bundles of axon surrounded by perineurium to give a nerve fascicle
    
    Bundles of nerve fascicles surrounded by epineurium to form a nerve trunk

### General Structures and Functions of Neurons

- What are the three physiological properties of a neuron in relation to its function?
    
    Excitability, Conductivity and Secretion, allowing the neuron to gather (excitability) and transmit electrochemical signals
    
- What is the basic structure of a neuron?
    
    Soma/Cell Body - contains nucleus and other organelles
    
    Dendrite - forms dendritic tree to collect stimulus, propagating electrochemical stimulation to soma
    
    Axon - conducts action potential away from the soma
    
    Synapse - specialized contact between neurons for transmission of information
    
- What are the three types of neurons based on morphology (number of processes)?
    
    Pseudounipolar neuron - Single process formed by fusion of axon and dendron, which divides into the peripheral axon that links to receptors, and the central axon that supplies to CNS, they generally are sensory neurons
    
    Bipolar neuron - consists of dendrite (1 process) and axon (1 process), usually specialised sensory neurons (e.g. Retinal bipolar neurons)
    
    Multipolar neurons - consist of 1 axon and many dendrites, forming a dendritic tree to collect signals in a larger environment (e.g. Motor neurons, pyramidal cells, Purkinje cell of cerebrum)
    
- What are the three types of neurons based on function?
    
    Sensory neuron - detect stimuli and transmit signal to CNS
    
    Motor neuron - send signal from CNS to effectors
    
    interneuron - receives signals from other neurons and integrate the information (process, store, retrieve and make decision)
    
- What is the general structure of the soma?
    
    Dilated region of the neuron, consisting nucleus and organelles, where proteins are produced
    
    Contains most cellular structures (nucleus, mitochondria, RER, SER, Golgi)
    
    Vescicles - Contains neurotransmitters, transported to axon terminal
    
    Neurofilaments - intermediate filaments that provide structural support for the axon and regulate axon diameter

    Retrograde transport - axonal terminal to cell body
    
- What is a synapse?
    
    A small junction across in which a nerve impulse is passed from the axon terminal to a neuron, a muscle cell or a gland cell
    
- How can synapses be classified based on function?
    
    Chemical synapses (neurons) - Electrical signals in the presynaptic cell is converted to chemical signals at the synapse and converted back to electrical signals at the postsynaptic cell
    
    The presynaptic cell releases neurotransmitters which diffuse across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the post synaptic cell
    
    Electrical synapses (gap junctions) - Electrical signals in forms of ions directly moves from one cell to another through gap junctions, allowing communication between smooth muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells and retinal cells
    
- How can synapses be classified based on morphology?
    
    Axosomatic synapses - synapse between axon and soma
    
    Axodendritic synapse (80%) - synapse between axon and dendrite
    
    Axoaxonic synapse - Synapse between 2 axons, forming a feedback loop to either enhance or inhibit a synaspse
    
- What is the structure of a synapse?
    
    Presynaptic terminal - consist synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters in the active zone
    
    Synaptic cleft - narrow intracellular space for diffusion of neurotransmitters
    
    Postsynaptic terminal - contains receptors and ion gates to receive chemical signals and convert them to electrical signals
    
- Describe the direction of neurotransmission.
    
    One way transmission - Presynaptic terminal → Synaptic cleft → Postsynaptic terminal
    
    Initiated by depolarization of presynaptic membrane

    Provide nutrition and trophic factors for neurons
    
    Maintain electrolyte balance
    
    Provide guidance for migrating neurons during neurogenesis by acting as scaffolding structures
    
    - Maintain and facilitate blood-brain-barrier
        
        Processes form feet at blood vessels and neurons to cover large areas of the outer surface of vessels or axolemma
        
    - Participate in injury responses (astrogliosis)
        
        Phagocytize neuronal debris and fill up space by forming glial scars
        
        Contain inflammation sites 
        
- Name the two myelin-forming glial cells in the nervous system.
    
    Oligodendrocytes (CNS) and Schwann cells (PNS)
    
- What is myelin sheath? What is the function of myelin sheath?
    
    White lipid electrically insulaing layer formed by myelin-forming glial cells
    
    Functions:
    
    Surround and protect the axon
    
    Accelerate transmission of action potential along axon, as action potential jump from node to node along the myelinated axon
    
- Describe the process of myelination.
    
    Initiated when the Schwann cell mesaxon or processes of oligodendrocyte surround the axon
    
    Mesaxon wraps around axon in a spiralling motion, forming concentric layers
    
    Cytoplasm is squeezed out from between the membrane of the concentric layers
    
    This decreases capacitance across the membrane, thus increasing electrical resistance 
    
- How do unmyelinated axons exist in PNS?
    
    Series of Schwann cells cover the length of axon tightly with no nodes of Ranvier in between
    
    Axons (single or group) fit into grooves in the surface of Schwann cells
    
    Large Schwann cells may have more than 20 grooves
    
- How doe unmyelinated axons exist in CNS?
    
    Bare, just exposed, not embedded in any glial cells
    
    Lack of basal lamina or connective tissue
    
- What are microglia?
    
    Smallest neuroglia
    
    Immune surveillance cells: Phagocytic cells, antigen presenting cell (similar to macrophages)
    
    Produce inflammatory factors like NO and cytokine
    
    Activated after injury - enlarged and become amoeboid shape upon activated
    
- What are ependymal cells?
    
    Epithelial-like cells of ventricles of CNS (cavities filled with CSF)
    
    Lack an external lamina
    
    Forms choroid plexus (Ependymal cells + blood capillary) for CSF production
    
- What are neural stem cells?
    
    Self-renewing, multipotent adult stem cells
    
    Can differentiate to replace lost or injured neurons or glial cells
    
    Neurogenesis occurs in Subventricular zones of lateral ventricles and the dentate gyrus of hippocampus
    
- Why do number of neurons decrease despite the presence of neural stem cells?
    
    Small number of neural stem cells
    

### Nervous system **response** to injury

- Describe the process of injury response in the PNS.
    
    Macrophages from circulation phagocytize neuronal debris
    
    Axon grow back to function normally
    
    Schwann cells will myelinate the axon at original position ⇒ myelin sheath may grow out of position, which results in functional deficits
    
- Describe the process of injury response in the CNS.
    
    Macrophage could not enter CNS to phagocytize neuronal debris due to presence of BBB
    
    Phagocytosis of debris by microglia is slow
    
    Astrocytes rush in to phagocitize debris, forming glial scars, which cut off regeneration route of axon
    
    Remaining debris release inhibitory factors for neuroregeneration 
    
- What are demyelinating diseases? What are the effects of demyelination?
    
    Characterised by preferential damage to myelin sheath, resulting in the loss of ability of axon to conduct electrical impulse
    
    Physical, mental and psychiatric problems arised
    
    Often a result of severe immune-mediated disease
