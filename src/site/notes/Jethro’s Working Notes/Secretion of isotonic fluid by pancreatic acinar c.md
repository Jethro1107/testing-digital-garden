### Secretion of isotonic fluid by pancreatic acinar cells is driven an ionic mechanism

**An ionic mechanism in pancreatic acinar cells enables the secretion of isotonic fluid consisting of Na+, Cl- and water.**

1. Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pumps out 3 Na+ and pumps in 2 K+ at the expense of 1 ATP.
2. This drives basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (pNBC1) to cotransport Na+ and HCO3- into the cell down the Na+ gradient.
3. As intracellular HCO3- levels increase, AE2 pumps out HCO3- in exchange for interstitial Cl-. i.e. *A system of transporters are responsible for the active transport of interstitial Cl- into pancreatic acinar cells*.
4. Upon stimulation ([[The basic factors that stimulate pancreatic secretions are acetylcholine, secretin and cholecystokinin\|The basic factors that stimulate pancreatic secretions are acetylcholine, secretin and cholecystokinin]]), increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels results in activated of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (TMEM16A).
5. Cl- is released into the lumen via the Ca2+ activated Cl- channels.
6. This creates a negative potential and an osmotic gradient that drives the movement of Na+ and water into the lumen via tight junctions.
