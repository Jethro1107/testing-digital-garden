### Different types of muscle fibres

- What are the three types of skeletal muscle fibres? What are their functions and properties?
    
    Type I (slow oxidative)
    
    slow-twitch fatigue resistant
    
    Slow ATP enzyme velocity
    
    ATP mainly produced my oxidative phosphorylation
    
    High oxidative enzyme activity
    
    Consist of large amounts of myoglobin, mitochondria and blood capillaries, giving the muscle fibre red colour
    
    Involved in long, slow contractions and sustained aerobic activities, e.g maintaining posture by postural muscles, and in marathon runners
    
    Type IIb (fast glycolytic)
    
    Fast-twitch, fatigue-prone
    
    Fast ATP enzyme velocity
    
    ATP mainly produced by glycolysis
    
    High anaerobic enzyme activity
    
    Consist of smaller amounts of myoglobin, mitochondria and blood capillaries, giving the muscle fibre white colour
    
    Involved in short, fast contractions and fine movements, e.g. biceps and triceps, muscles involved in fine movements
    
    Type IIa (fast oxidative glycolytic)
    
    Fast-twitch
    
    Intermediate properties
