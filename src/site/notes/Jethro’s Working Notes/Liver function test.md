### Liver function test

Liver function test is a series of blood tests that monitor various liver functions:

- ******************************************************************Components of liver function test******************************************************************
    
    Synthetic functions - Total protein, Albumin, Prothrombin time/International normalised ratio (PT/INR)
    
    Excretory functions - Total bilirubin, conjugated (direct) bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin
    
    Liver enzymes - Parenchymal enzymes (AST, ALT), Ductal enzymes (ALP, GGT)
    

### Implications of each component of liver function test

- **************Albumin**************
    
    Albumin is the major plasma protein in blood, and is synthesised exclusively in the liver.
    
    It has a long half-life, approximately 3 weeks. Normally, albumin is not excreted.
    
    A reduction of albumin (Hypoalbuminemia) has two implications:
    
    - **********************************Reduced synthesis********************************** - Reduction of synthetic functions of the liver, *rarely reflected in an acute setting (due to its long half-life)*, but *apparent in chronic liver diseases* such as [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cirrhosis\|Cirrhosis]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatocellular carcinoma\|Hepatocellular carcinoma]].
    - ******************Increased excretion****************** - Normally, albumin is not excreted (via renal mechanisms). But in [[nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]], there may be an increase in excretion.
- ******************Bilirubin******************
    
    There are essentially 3 values from bilirubin assays: Total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin.
    
    The main function of bilirubin is the identification of the types of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Jaundice\|Jaundice]]. by ****************************following the bilirubin in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bilirubin metabolism\|Bilirubin metabolism]].*
    
    **Haemolytic jaundice (Prehepatic)** - Caused by haemolytic disorders (Intravascular and extravascular). There is an increase in heme breakdown, resulting in increased bilivirdin production, and hence an i*ncrease in unconjugated bilirubin**********,*********** or **************************************Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia**************************************.
    
    - Other differential diagnosis for unconjugated bilirubinemia includes:
        - Haemolysis
        - Gilbert’s syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome
        - Mild chronic hepatitis
    
    ******************************************************************Hepatocellular jaundice (Hepatic)****************************************************************** - Caused by various causes of acute [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatitis\|Hepatitis]]. When hepatocytes die, there is leakage of bilirubin (of both conjugated and unconjugated moiety), that results in ************************************Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia************************************.
    
    **********************************************************************************************Cholestatic jaundice (Hepatic or post-hepatic)********************************************************************************************** - Caused by biliary obstruction. Failure of biliary excretion of bilirubin, results in systemic absorption of bilirubin (of both conjugated and unconjugated moiety), that results in ************************************************************Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia************************************************************.
    
    - Other differential diagnosis for conjugated bilirubinemia includes:
        - Hepatocellular disease ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatitis\|Hepatitis]])
        - Biliary obstruction
        - Inherited defects in excretion e.g. Dubin-Johnson Syndrome, Rotor’s syndrome
- **************************Liver enzymes**************************
    
    There are two sets of enzymes analysed in liver enzymes: ****************************************Parenchymal enzymes**************************************** and ******************************Ductal enzymes.******************************
    
    ****************************************************************************Parenchymal enzymes (e.g. AST and ALT)****************************************************************************
    
    AST and ALT are found within hepatocytes (as well as other cells), and are a good marker of hepatocellular injury.
    
    AST can be found in the liver, skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, kidney and the brain, with 2 kinds, cytosolic AST, and mitochondrial AST.
    
    ALT is predominantly in the liver, and is thus a more sensitive marker for hepatocellular injury.
    
    - Elevation of parenchymal enzymes of 10 to 100 times of normal value indicates ****************************************hepatocellular injury.****************************************
    - Elevation of parenchymal enzymes of less than 10 times indicates **********************cholestasis**********************.
    - Normally ***********************************************increase in ALT is greater than increase in AST************,************* with the exception of:
        - Alcoholic hepatitis ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Alcoholic liver disease\|Alcoholic liver disease]])
        - Wide spread hepatic necrosis, as a result of toxic or ischaemic liver injuries
        
        This is because there is also release of mitochondrial AST.
        
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    ******************************************************************Ductal enzymes (e.g. ALP and GGT)******************************************************************
    
    ALP has multiple origins: bone, placenta and in the liver.
    
    To determine the various source of ALP:
    
    - Heat stability test - placenteal ALP is most heat stable, followed by liver ALP, then bone ALP.
    - Concomitent increase in GGT confirms liver origin (if not alcoholic, or not on enzyme inducing drugs)
    
    GGT is a ductal enzyme found predominantly in the liver, but can be induced by alcohol and drugs (e.g. phenytoin, rifampacin, phenobarbital)
    
    Increase in ALP and GGT confirms a cholestatic disease.
    

### Putting it all together: Evaluation of liver function test as a whole

- ******************************Patterns of LFT******************************
    
    Hepatocellular pattern - Characterised by predominant increase in parenchymal enzymes
    
    Cholestatic pattern - Characterised by increase in ductal enzymes
    
    But these patterns may be blurred in prolonged or chronic disease, as:
    
    - Prolonged cholestasis can result in hepatocellular injury
    - Acute hepatitis may develop a cholestatic element (intrahepatic cholestasis)
    - Hepatocellular enzymes may paradoxically drop in chronic liver disease.
