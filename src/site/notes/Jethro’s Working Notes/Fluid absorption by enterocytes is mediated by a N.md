### Fluid absorption by enterocytes is mediated by a Na+ dependent mechanism

At different segments of the intestine, fluid absorption by enterocytes is mediated by Na+ dependent mechanisms.

- **In the small intestine:**
    
    Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pumps out 3 Na+ and pumps in 2K+ at the expense of 1 ATP.
    
    This creates a Na+ gradient, which drives Na+ reabsorption through the brush border membrane of certain carrier proteins: *1) SGLT1* (recall that [[Absorption of carbohydrates is mediated by by Na+ dependent transport and facilitated diffusion\|Absorption of carbohydrates is mediated by by Na+ dependent transport and facilitated diffusion]]), *2) sodium-amino acid cotransporters* (recall that [[Absorption of luminal oligopeptides and amino acids into enterocytes occur via different mechanisms\|Absorption of luminal oligopeptides and amino acids into enterocytes occur via different mechanisms]]), and *3) Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE)*.
    
    *Active absorption of Na+ across the brush border membrane creates a positive potential and a hyperosmotic interstitium that drives the absorption of Cl- and water via the paracellular route.* Note that Cl- diffusion via paracellular route is a mechanism of Cl- absorption that occurs in the jejunum.
    
    In the ileum and the proximal colon, Cl- is reabsorbed by apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, which pumps out HCO3- in exchange for luminal Cl-. Cl- leaves the enterocyte via basolateral Cl- channels.

- **In the proximal colon, active Na+ absorption is mediated by 2 mechanisms:**
    
    Apical sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (NCMT1) cotransports Na+ with short chained fatty acids into enterocytes. Short-chained fatty acids is utilised by enterocytes for intracellular metabolism, rather than being absorbed into circulation.
    
    Apical NHE co-transports pumps H+ and pumps in Na+. This is coupled with Cl-/HCO3- exchanger.

    Na+ absorption creates a positive potential and a hyperosmotic interstitium, which drives absorption of Cl- and water.
    
- **In the distal colon:**
    
    Apical Epithelial Na+ Channels (ENaC) transports Na+ down the Na+ gradient, created by basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase.
    
    This creates an osmotic gradient that drives absorption of water.
    
    Water absorption in the distal colon is regulated by aldosterone, a hormone released by the cortex of the adrenal glands that is largely involved in maintaining fluid balance.
    
    When dehydrated, aldosterone released results in increased synthesis and and insertion of ENaC into the apical membrane, driving Na+ and water absorption as a last ditch attempt to avoid excessive water loss.
