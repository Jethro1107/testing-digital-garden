### Radioulnar joint

- **Proximal radioulnar joint**
    
    The proximal radioulnar joint involves the articulation between the head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna.
    
    The head of the radius inserts into annular ligament of the radius and articulates with the radial notch of the ulna.
    
    The quadrate ligament reinforces the joint capsule inferiorly.

- **Distal radioulnar joint**
    
    The distal radioulnar joint involves the articulation between the head of the ulnar and the ulnar notch of the radius.
    
    A fibrocartilage, the articular disc, is present distally of the joint, and connects the distal ends of the radius and the ulna. The same fibrocartilage prevents the participation of the ulna in the [[Wrist joint (radiocarpal [[joint)\|Wrist joint (radiocarpal [[joint)]]]].
