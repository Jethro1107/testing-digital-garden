# CPR90: Congenital abnormalities of urinary tract and obstructive uropathy

### Congenital abnormalities of urinary tract

- Congenital abnormalities of the kidneys
    - Abnormalities in renal mass
        - **Common congenital abnormalities in renal mass**
            - Agenesis
                - **Epidimeology of agenesis of kidneys**
                    - Unilateral - 1:550
                    - Bilateral - 1:4000 (incompatible with life)
                - **Consequences of agenesis of kidneys**
                    - Failure of formation of kidneys results in decrease in urine production by a foetus in utero
                    - Urine produced in utero is the main source of amniotic fluid
                    - Reduction of amniotic fluid results in **oligohydramnios**
                    - Significant oligohydramnios triggers Potter’s Sequence (A historic term that describes the cascade of anomalies triggered by significant oligohydramnios secondary to renal disease)
                    - Potter’s sequence includes:
                        - Potter/ Flattened facies
                        - [[Pasted image 20220521160546.png\|300]]
                        - Positional abnormalities of hands and feet
                        - Dislocation of hip
                        - Hypoplastic lungs (Reduced development of lung due to reduced inhalation of lung)
            - Hypoplasia
                - **Epidimeology of hypoplasia of kidneys**
                    - Mostly unilateral
                    - Bilateral renal hypoplasia often results in renal failure in childhood
    - **Abnormalities in shape and position**
        - Horshoe shaped kidneys - Fusion of lower poles (90%) or upper poles (10%)
        - Ectopic kidneys - kidneys located just above pelvic brim or in pelvis
            - Results in kinking or tortuosity of ureters, resulting in urinary obstruction, predisposing to infection
    - **Abnormalities in differentiation**
        - Multicystic renal dysplasia
            - **What is multicystic renal dysplasia?**
                - Multicystic renal dyspasia is a sporadic disorder with developmental abnormality of the metanephric duct resulting in aberrant differentiation of metanephric blastoma
                - It is not a preneoplastic lesion, but a developmental disorder
            - **Pathology of multicystic renal dysplasia**
                - Gross pathology:
                - Kidney may be enlarged, irregular and multicystic
                - Multicystic renal dysplasia may be unilateral or bilateral, affecting the whole kidney or part of the kidney [[Pasted image 20220521162924.png\|300]]
                - Histopathology:
                - Characteristic presence of cartilages and primitive tubules [[Pasted image 20220521162942.png\|300]]
            - **Association of multicystic renal dysplasia**
                - Associated with ureteropelvic obstruction, lower urinary tract obstruction
        - Autosomal recessive (Childhood) polycystic kidney disease
            - **What is autosomal recessive (Childhood) polycystic kidney disease?**
                - A rare autosomal recessive disorder characterised by cystic dilitation of renal collecting duct and results in congenital hepatic cirrhosis
                - It is classified into perinatal, neonatal, infantile and juvenile subcategories by the time of presentation and presence of associated hepatic lesions
            - **Genetics of autosomal recessive (Childhood) polycystic kidney disease**
                - Mutation of PKHD1 gene on chromosome 6p21-p23
                - The gene encodes fibrocystin (function is unknown)
            - **Pathology of autosomal recessive (Childhood) polycystic kidney disease**
                - Bilateral enlarged kidneys
                    - On cut section, there are numerous small cysts in the cortex and medulla, and cystic dilitation of collecting duct replacing the cortex and medulla [[Pasted image 20220521164757.png\|300]]
                - Enlarged liver
                - Hypoplastic lungs - due to significant oligohydramnios
            - **Complications of autosomal recessive (Childhood) polycystic kidney disease**
                - Death:
                    - Due to neonatal respiratory failure
                    - Renal failure
                - Other complications:
                    - Potter’s sequence
                    - Congenital hepatic cirrhosis
                    - End-stage renal failure, requiring renal replacement therapy
        - Autosomal dominant (Adult) polycystic kidney disease
            - **What is autosomal dominant (Adult) polycystic kidney disease?**
                - Autosomal dominant (adult) polycystic kidney disease is a hereditary disorder characterized by multiple expanding cysts of both kidneys that ultimately destroy the renal parenchyma and cause renal failure ^37c812
            - **Genetics of autosomal dominant (Adult) polycystic kidney disease**
                - PKD1 gene on chromosome 16 - accounts for 85% of the cases
                - PKD2 gene on chromosome 4 - slower rate of disease progression than PKD1 mutation
            - **Pathology of autosomal dominant (Adult) polycystic kidney disease**
                - Bilateral nodular enlarged kidneys
                - Numerous dilated cysts in cortex and medulla, destroying the intervening parenchyma
            - **Clinical presentation of autosomal dominant (Adult) polycystic kidney disease**
                - Autosomal dominant (Adult) polycystic kidney disease does not produce symptoms until middle age (4th decade of life)
                - Often presents as:
                    - An abdominal mass
                    - Flank pain
                    - Inteermittent gross hematuria
                    - Most important complication - Hypertension
                    - Clinically manifests as chronic kidney disease
            - **Associated features of autosomal dominant (Adult) polycystic kidney disease**
                - Berry aneurysms of the circle of Willis - high incidence of subarchnoid hemorrhage
                - Polycystic liver, lungs and pancreas
                - Diverticulosis of large intestine
- Congenital abnormalities of the ureters
    - Bifid ureters
    - Valves
    - Strictures
    - Retrocaval ureters
    - Ectopic openings
- **Congenital abnoramlities of the urinary bladder**
    - Extrophy of urinary bladder - due to development failure of anterior abdominal wall and urinary bladder, requiring surgical correction
        - Associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma
    - **Urachal abnormalities**
        - Fistulous urinary tract - whole urachus remains patent, connecting the bladder to the umbilicus
        - Urachal cyst - central region of urachus remains patent, increasing risk of neoplastic transformation, particularly presenting with adenoma
- **Congenital abnormalities of the urethra**
    - Hypospadias - abnormal urethral opening on ventral side of penis
    - Epispadias - abnormal urethral opening on dorsal side of penis
        - Associated with urinary obstruction, predisposing to ascending infections
    - When the orifices are situated near the base of the penis, normal ejaculation and insemination are hampered and may be a cause of sterility
    - Urethral valves - usually located at posterior urethra

### Obstructive uropathy

- **What is obstructive uropathy?**
    - Obstructive uropathy, also known as urinary tract obstruction involves the formation of obstructive lesion of the urinary tract that increases the susceptibility of infection, stone formation, and unrelieved obstruction almost leads to permanent renal damage and impairment of renal function
- **Common obstructive lesions**
    - Males - Benign prostate hyperplasia
    - Females - pregnancy
    - Urolithiasis (Renal stones)
        - **What is urolithiasis?**
            - Urolithiasis (renal stones) refers to calculus formation at any level of the urinary system, but often arises in the kidneys, and often lodges in the ureters
        - **Epidimeology of urolithiasis**
            - More frequent in males than in females
            - Peak incidence: 20-30 years old
        - **4 major types of renal stones and their pathogenesis**
            - Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones (70%):
                - Result of idiopathic hypercalciuria, or hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria
            - Magnesium ammonium phosphate stones/ Struvite (5-10%):
                - Associated with infections by urea-splitting bacteria e.g. Proteus, staphylococi
                - Able to form large stones such as staghorn calculi, which lodges in the pelvicalyceal system [[Pasted image 20220523102106.png\|375]]
            - Uric acid stones (5-10%):
                - Related to hyperuricemia
            - Cysteine stones (1-2%):
                - Related to genetically determined defect in the renal transport of certain amino acids, including cystine Cf: [[Robbins Etiology and pathology of urolithiasis\|Robbins Etiology and pathology of urolithiasis]]
        - **Clinical features of urolithiasis**
            - Results in acute renal colic due to ureteric obstrunction
            - Gross haematuria may also occur Cf: [[Robbins Clinical features of urolithiasis\|Robbins Clinical features of urolithiasis]]
    - Urothelial tumours
    - Fibrosis and strictures (due to infection and inflammation)
    - Neurogenic bladder
- **Consequences of obstructive uropathy**
    - Obstructive uropathy results in acute renal colic
        - **What is acute renal colic?**
            - Acute renal colic is an acute pain caused by acute ureteric obstructions (often due to renal stones)
            - Acute renal colic is characterised by paroxysms of flank loin pain radiating to the suprapublic regions
    - Obstructive uropathy predisposes to urinary tract infection
    - Obstructive uropathy may result in hydronephrosis and hydroureters
    - Unrelieved obstruction almost leads to permanent renal damage and impairment of renal function
- Bladder outflow obstruction
    - **Common causes of bladder outflow obstruction**
        - Benign prostate hyperplasia, tumours, calculi
    - **Consequences of bladder outflow obstruction**
        - Predisposes to urinary tract infection
        - Bladder hypertrophy - trabeculation
        - Bladder diverticuli
        - Bilateral hydroureters and hydronephrosis
        - Vesicoureteric reflux
        - Acute urine retention - acute renal failure
    - **Symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction**
        - Collectively known as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), previously known as prostatism, includes:
            - Weak streams
            - Hesitancy
            - Urinary frequency and nocturia - due to incomplete voiding of bladder
- Vesicoureteric reflux
    - **Mechanism of prevention of vesicoureteric reflux**
        - During micturition, contraction of bladder muscles compress on the intramural part of ureters to prevent reflux
    - **Etiology of vesicoureteric reflux**
        - Primary VUR - incompent or inadequate closure of vesicoureteric junction as a result of a congenitally short intramural ureter [[Pasted image 20220523110731.png\|375]]
        - Secondary VUR - due to elevated intravesicular pressure that results in failure of closure of vesicoureteric junction
    - **Grading of vesicoureteric reflux**
        - Graded using a voiding cystogram with radiocontrast dye
        - Grade 1 - reflux limited to non-dilated ureter
        - Grade II - reflux to renal pelvis without dilitation of ureters
        - Grade III - reflux with mild dilitation of ureters and renal pelvis
        - Grade IV - reflux with moderate dilitation and/or tortuosity of ureters
        - Grade V - severe dilitation and torturosity of ureters, pelvis and calyces [[Pasted image 20220523111040.png\|Pasted image 20220523111040.png]]
    - **Consequence of vesicoureteric reflux**
        - Renal scarring due to high pressure or infection (pyelonephritis)
        - Reflux associated renal scars tends to occur in polar regions where reflux tends to occur
        - [[Pasted image 20220523111330.png\|Pasted image 20220523111330.png]]
- Papillary necrosis
    - **What is papillary necrosis?**
        - Necrosis of renal papilla, a complication of urinary obstruction, pyelonephritis, and vascular diseases such as diabetic nephropathy drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis, sickle cell nephropathy
    - **Effects of papillary necrosis**
        - Haematuria
        - Acute renal colic
        - Acute renal failure
        - Chronic renal failure
        - Predisposition to urothelial cancer
