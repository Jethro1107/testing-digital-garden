### Glucocorticoid as a hormone

Despite being considered as an anti-inflammatory drug ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug\|Glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug]]), *at physiological levels, the key effects of the endogenous glucocorticoid ‘**Cortisol**’ is not anti-inflammatory, but has metabolic effects, plays a role in Ca2+ homeostasis, regulates renal function, and many other functions.*

### Glucocorticoid mediates its effects in 2 ways

Glucocorticoids may mediate its physiological effects in 2 ways:

1. A direct effect on cells (which usually has a dose-response relationship)
2. A permissive effect, permitting the effects of other hormones
    
    Catacholamines (lipolysis and vascular response), ACTH, growth hormones will have attenuated response in the absence of cortisol.
    

### Metabolic effects of glucocorticoids

Cortisol, at physiological levels, have effects on carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and protein metabolism.

- **********************************************************************************************************Effects of glucocorticoids on carbohydrate metabolism**********************************************************************************************************
    
    Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis and decreases glucose uptake and utilization by cells in fast state.
    
    Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis in the liver by:
    
    - Stimulating phosphoenopyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase on the gluconeogenic pathway.
    - Stimulating protein catabolism and lipolysis, providing amino acids and glycerol as substrates for gluconeogenesis
    
    Glucocorticoids decrease glucose uptake and utilization in cells by:
    
    - Translocation of GLUT4 from the plasma membrane into the intracellular position, inducing ******************insulin resistance******************.
    
    The net effect, a rise in blood glucose level, enables glucose to be mobilized to the brain in fast state.
    
- ********************************************************Effects of glucocorticoids on protein metabolism********************************************************
    
    Glucocorticoids directly inhibit protein synthesis and stimulate protein breakdown in extrahepatic cells.
    
    This enables delivery of amino acids to the liver for gluconeogenesis.
    
- ****************************************************************************************************************Effects of glucocorticoids on lipid metabolism****************************************************************************************************************
    
    Glucocorticoids permit a lipolytic response mediated by catacholamines which has 2 effects:
    
    1. It provides glycerol as a substrate for gluconeogenesis
    2. It results in mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissues to cells for utilization.
        
        As glucocorticoids raise blood glucose level, insulin is released, which triggers lipogenesis, which results in redistribution of fats to the trunk (e.g. face, back of neck and supraclavicular areas).
        

### ********************************************************************************Glucocorticoids affects Ca2+ homeostasis********************************************************************************

Glucocorticoids **********************************************************************antagonize the effects of vitamin D**********************************************************************, inhibit calcium absorption from gastrointestinal tract, and increase calcium excretion by the kidneys, causing a drop in blood calcium levels.

This results in bone resorption to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis, underlying osteoporosis in Cushing’s syndrome.

### Glucocorticoids affects renal functions

Glucocorticoids seem to have permissive effects on tubular functions, promoting water excretion by the kidneys and maintaining glomerular filtration rate.

### Vascular effects of glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids permit vascular response to catacholamines, enabling vasoconstriction.

### Neurological effects of glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids regulate the nervous system, affecting neuronal survival and activity.

High cortisol levels may result initially in insomnia, mood elevations, euphoria, and subsequently depression.

Cortisol has systemic effects, and can result in quite severe effects if its production is slightly higher or lower. Fortunately, [[Cortisol secretion is tightly regulated in the Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\|Cortisol secretion is tightly regulated in the Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]].
