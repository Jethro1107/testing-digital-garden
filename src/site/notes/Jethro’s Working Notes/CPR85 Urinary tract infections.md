    Women:men ratio = 30:1
    
    Around 25% of adult women have had an incidence of urinary tract infection by age 30
    
    Extremely rare in adult male, until obstruction from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
    
    Accounts for 30-40% of nosocomial infections, often associated with use of catheters

- Entry of urinary tract infection agents
    - **Mode of entry of common urinary tract infection agents**
        
        Urinary tract infections is often caused by enteric or skin bacteria, ascending from the urethra
        
        Urinary tract infections are commonly caused by:
        
        Echerichia Coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus species and Group B streptococci
        
        E. Coli associated with urinary tract infections is often called uropathogenic E. Coli (UPEC) or extranintestinal pathogenic E. Coli (ExPEC)
        
    - **Host factors affecting entry of urinary tract infection agents**
        
        Length of urethra - female more susceptible due to much shorter urethra
        
        Mechanical factors - sexual intercourse, contraceptive diaphragm, trauma and catheter
        
        Hormonal effects on mucosa:
        
        In females, oestrogen and progesterone maintain the health of the urinary tract mucosa
        
        Such that after menopause, frequency of urinary tract infections increase
        
        Underlying disease
        
- Spread of urinary tract infection agents
    - **Route of spread of urinary tract infection after entry**
        
        Urinary bladder → Ureters → Kidneys → Blood (Bacteremia)
        
    - **Host factors affecting spread of urinary tract infection agents**
        
        Reflux - incompetent ureterovesicle valves
        
        Poor emptying of bladder - neurogenic bladder
        
        Dilitation and decreased peristalsis of ureters (e.g. during pregnancy)
        
        Nidus for persistence (e.g. the use of catheters)
        
        Obstruction - stones
        
        Immunocomprimised - e.g. malignancies, diabetes mellitus
        
- Damage of urinary tract infection agents
    - **Virulence factor of UPEC**
        
        Adherance - Type 1 fimbrae, Pyelonephritis-associated (P) fimbrae
        
        Antiphagocytic - polysaccharide capsule
        
        Invasion - protease
        
        Toxin - hemolysin, aerobactin (cause tissue damage)
        
        Lipopolysaccharides - trigger inflammation
        
        Urease - formation of urinary stones

### Common syndromes of urinary tract infections

- **Complicated UTIs vs uncomplicated UTIs**
    
    Unomplicated UTIs refer to urinary tract infection that affects a structurally and neurologically normal urinary tract, which often affects otherwise healthy individuals
    
    Complicated UTIs refer to urinary tract infection associated with factors that comprimise the urinary tract or host defense (e.g. urinary obstruction, neurogenic bladder, pregnancy, renal transplant, stones, catheter, immunosuppression)

    Note that relapse and reinfection is difficult to distinguish
    

### Diagnosis of urinary tract infections

- **2 evidence used for diagnosis of urinary tract infections**
    
    Pyuria - defined as more than 10 leukocytes per high powerfield (400x)
    
    Significant bacteriuria - often defined as ≥ 10^5 CFU (colony forming units) per ml, but varies with condition and sample collected
    
- **Dipstick test for diagnosis of urinary tract infections**
    - Inferring bacteriuria from dipstick test
        - **Principle of bacteriuria inference from dipstick test**
            
            Dipstick test can be used for nitrite detection
            
            Some etiological agents such as enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus, proteus and pseudomonas express nitrate reductase, which reduce nitrates into nitrates
            
            Nitrates react with substrates within the strip to produce a pink colour, thus indicating bacteriuria

        - **Limitations of dipstick test of inferring bacteriuria**
            
            Some bacteria (e.g. enterococcus) do not express nitrate reductase
            
            Urine may not be retained in the bladder for long enough for reduction of nitrates into nitrates due to frequency
            
            Implications - While a positive nitrite test from dipstick is a reliable index for significant bacteriuria, a negative nitrite test does not exclude bacteriuria
            
    - Inferring pyuria from dipstick test
        - **Principle of pyuria inference from dipstick test**
            
            Leukocytes release leukocyte esterase
            
            Leukocyte esterase reacts with substrate on dipstick test to give purple colour, thus indicating pyuria

        - **Limitations of dipstick test of inferring pyuria**
            
            Some drugs (e.g. cephalexin) and high glucose level may interfere with the reaction, resulting in false negative
            
            Positive result may result of contamination by vaginal discharge
            
- Culture for significant bacteriuria
    - **Different urine samples and their cutoff for significant bacteriuria**
        
        Mid-stream urine sample - ≥10^5 CFU/ml
        
        Clean catch urine - ≥10^5 CFU/ml
        
        Pediatric urine bag - ≥10^5 CFU/ml
        
        Indwelling urine catheter - ≥10^5 CFU/ml (symptoms required)
        
        Suprapubic tap urine - any growth
        

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria

- **Epidemiology of asymptomatic bacteriuria**
    
    Common in elderly and debilitated
    
- **Consequences of asymptomatic bacteriuria**
    
    No significant consequences, does not result in chronic nephritis, renal failure, hypertension etc.
    
- **Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria**
    
    No treatment is required as it would result in selection of resistant strains
    
    Treatment commonly results in recurrent infections
    
    Only pregnant women, people before urological operations and children (with ureterovesicular reflux) requires treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria

### Acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis

- Acute bacterial prostatitis
    - **Risk factors of acute bacterial prostatitis**
        
        Unprotected anal intercourse
        
        Indwelling use of urinary catheter
        
        Prostate biopsy
        
    - **Clinical presentation of ABP**
        
        High fever is common
        
        Dysuria
        
        Frequency and urgency
        
        Perineal pain
        
        Urinary retention is common - as oedematous prostate obstructs the prostatic urethra
        
        Rectal examination - very tender prostate
        
    - Urine culture of ABP
        
        Yields pathogen, usually E. Coli ≥10^5 cfu/ml
        
- Chronic bacterial prostatitis
    - **What is chronic bacterial prostatitis?**
        
        Recurrent infection/ Relapsing UTI by the same organism
        
    - **Diagnosis of chronic bacterial prostatitis**
        
        Diagnosis of chronic bacterial prostatitis usually involves finding a higher bacterial count in prostatic fluid than in urinary/ bladder fluid
        
        Requires a positive 4 glass or 2 glass test
