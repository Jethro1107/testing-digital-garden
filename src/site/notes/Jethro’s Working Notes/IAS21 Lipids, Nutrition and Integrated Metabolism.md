### Significance of Lipids

- What are the functions of lipids in our body?
    
    As a structural component - Cell Membrane
    
    As fuel molecules in fast state - Beta-Oxidation
    
    As an extracellular or intracellular signal - Medium for transport of other hydrophobic molecules
    
    Involved in transport of lipid-soluble molecules - Lipoproteins
    
- How is lipid metabolism integrated into glucose metabolism?
    
    In fed state, glucose to supply glycerol for TAG synthesis
    
    In fed state, glucose to supply Acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis
    
    In fast state, fatty acid to supply Propionyl-CoA for potential use for gluconeogenesis (converted into Succinyl-CoA in TCA cycle)
    
    Glycolysis of glucose supplies NADPH for fatty acid synthesis:
    
    NADPH provides reducing power to reduce acetyl-CoA

### Integrated Metabolism

- How does the body build metabolic reserves?
    
    Make use of glucose, TAG and amino acid surplus
    
- Why is nutrition linked to metabolism?
    
    Good Nutrition will secure the supply both macronutrients and micronutrients
    
    Macronutrients are required in metabolism
    
    Micronutrients such as vitamins act as coenzymes in metabolism
    
- How do vitamins take part in metabolism?
    
    As coenzymes
    
    Upon binding of conenzymes/confactors, inactive apoenzymes are converted into active holoenzymes
    
    Many metabolic enzymes are Vitamin B-dependent
    
- How does Vitamin B2 take part in metabolism?
    
    Riboflavin is involved in the formation of FAD (Flavin, adenidine dinucleotide), involved in TCA cycle and ETC
    
- How does Vitamin B12 take part in metabolism?
    
    In fatty acid oxidation:
    
    - Vitamin B12 plays a role in fatty acid oxidation, particularly in the conversion of Proprionyl-CoA into Succinyl-CoA, for gluconeogenesis
    - Propionyl-CoA is converted into D-methylmalonyl-CoA under propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which is a biotin dependent enzyme
    - D-methylmalonyl-CoA is converted into L-methylmalonyl-CoA under the action of methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase
    - L-methylmalonyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA under the action of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a B12 dependent enzyme
    
    In 1C metabolism:
    
    Involved in the transfer of methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH2-THF) in folate cycle to homocysteine in methylation cycle, catalyzed by methionine synthase, a B12 dependent enzyme
    
- How does Vitamin B7 take part in metabolism?
    
    In fatty acid oxidation:
    
    Propionyl-CoA is converted into D-methylmalonyl-CoA under the action of propionyl-CoA oxidase, a B7 dependent enzyme
    
    Involved in fatty acid synthesis:
    
    Acetyl-CoA is converted to Malonyl-CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), a Biotin dependent enzyme
    
    Biotin acts as a CO2 acceptor molecule in ACC, such that the carbon atom can be incorporated into acetyl-CoA
    
- Malonyl-CoA supplies 3C, but only 2C is added to the growing fatty acid chain. Why?
    
    A CO2 molecule is lost to provide a thermodynamic drive for fatty acid chain to grow
    
- How does Vitamin B5 take part in metabolism?
    
    For synthesis of CoA
    
- How does Vitamin B6 take part in metabolism?
    
    Involved in glycogen metabolism (glycogenolysis)
    
    Acts as a coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase
