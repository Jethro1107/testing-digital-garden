### Muscle tension is dependent on motor unit recruitment

Muscle tension generated is dependent on:

- Number of active motor units (spatial recruitment)
- Frequency of activation of motor unit (temporal recruitment, or [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Twitch, summation and tetanus\|Twitch, summation and tetanus]])

Motor unit recruitment can be measured using an [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Electromyogram\|Electromyogram]].
