### Viral hepatitis

- 5 main causes of viral hepatitis
    
    Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis D, Hepatitis E
    
- Acute hepatitis is mainly caused by HAV and HEV, but can still be caused by HBV, HCV and HDV.
- Chronic viral hepatitis is mainly caused by HBV in our locality. However, in places like Egypt, HCV is the main etiology of chronic viral hepatitis.
- **Clinical features of acute viral hepatitis**
    
    Most individuals with acute viral hepatitis are asymptomatic.
    
    Viral hepatitis classically presents with:
    
    - Fever
    - Right upper quadrant abdominal pain
    - **Jaundice**, **dark urine**, **pale stools**
    - Vomiting
    - Diarrhea
    - Loss of appetite
    - Fatigue
- **Clinical manifestations of chronic viral hepatitis**
    
    Chronic viral hepatitis manifests as liver [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cirrhosis\|Cirrhosis]] , and can complicate as [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatocellular carcinoma\|Hepatocellular carcinoma]].
    
- **Microbial diagnosis of viral hepatitis**
    - Viral hepatitis is diagnosed via Basic blood tests (LFT), antibody tests, antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification (PCR/ RT-PCR).
        - Antibody detection - Anti-HAV IgM, Anti-HBV IgM, Anti-HCV Ab, Anti-HDV IgM and Anti-HEV IgM
        - Antigen detection (Mainly used for HBV infections) - HBsAg and HBcAg
        - Nucleic acid amplification

### Hepatitis A virus (HAV)

- **Virology of hepatitis A virus**
    
    HAV is a Small non-eveloped RNA virus of the genus hepatovirus within the family Picornaviridae.
    
    It pocesses a single-stranded RNA genome.
    
    It is a tough virus with good environmental ‘surivival’ due to a tough outer capsid.
    
- **Transmission of hepatitis A virus**
    
    Hepatitis A virus involves person-to-person transmission via the feco-oral route, this involves:
    
    - Transmission via direct contact with an infected individual
    - Ingestion of contaminated food, especially *shellfish and seafood*
    - Rarely via blood transfusion
    - Occasionally occurs in outbreaks in men who have sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users who share needles
- **Clinical features of HAV infection**
    
    In children (<6 years old), most (70% of infected) are assymptomatic or present with mild anicteric (hepatitis without clinical jaundice) illness.
    
    In older children and in adults, HAV infection often manifests as more severe diseases. More than 70% infected develop icteric hepatitis. There is high mortality within individuals with chronic liver diseases.
    
    However, there is no chronic carriage of HAV.
    
- **Diagnosis of HAV infection**
    
    HAV detection is diagnosed by:
    
    - Antibody detection - Anti-HAV IgM
    - Nucleic acid amplification - RT-PCR
- **Management of HAV infection**
    
    No antivirals is available for HAV infections. Supportive treatment is provided.
    
    Liver transplant may be performed in severe cases (Fulminant hepatitis).
    
- **Prevention of HAV infection**
    
    HAV infection can be prevented with *good dietary hygiene and good personal hygiene*.
    
    *Hepatitis A vaccine* is available, and is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis and recommended for individuals before they travel to highly endemic areas. However, HAV vaccination is not part of the universal childhood immunisation programme.
    
    Anti-HAV immunoglobin ([[passive immunization\|passive immunization]]) to provide short term prophylaxis, suitable for urgent travelers or household contacts of hepatitis A patients.
    

### Hepatitis E virus (HEV)

- **Virology of hepatitis E virus**
    
    HEV is a small, non-enveloped RNA virus.
    
    It has a single-stranded RNA genome.
    
    It is a tough virus with good environmental ‘survival’ due to a tough outer capsid.
    
- **Transmission of hepatitis E virus**
    
    Transmission of hepatitis E virus depends on the setting:
    
    - In areas with poor sanitation, it is involved with human-to-human transmission via the feco-oral route. Large outbreaks are common in these settings.
    - In areas with good sanitation, it is via food-bourne and associated with consumption of undercooked pork (e.g. 豬潤粥).
    - Rarely, HEV is transmitted via transfusion of contaminated blood products.
- **Clinical manifestations of HEV infections**
    
    HEV infections can cause acute hepatitis:
    
    Most infected individuals are assymptomatic, but can cause severe liver disease in susceptible individuals: elderly, pregnant women (High mortality in pregnant women infected in the 3rd trimester) and individuals with chronic liver disease.
    
    HEV infections may cause chronic hepatitis in immunocomprimised individuals:
    
    - HIV patients
    - Transplant patients
    - Patients receiving chemotherapy etc.
- **Diagnosis of HEV infections**
    
    Acute hepatitis caused by HEV is diagnosed by antibody detection (Anti-HEV IgM).
    
    Chronic hepatitis caused by HEV is diagnosed by RT-PCR.
    
- **Treatment of HEV infections**
    
    There is no antiviral treatment for HEV infections.
    
    In acute hepatitis E:
    
    - supportive treatment is provided.
    - Liver transplant is reserved in severe cases (Fulminant hepatitis).
    
    In Chronic hepatitis E:
    
    - Reduction of immunosuppression
    - Oral ribavirin
- **Prevention of HEV infections**
    
    Wash and cook food properly, especially pork.
    
    Maintain good personal hygiene.
    
    Hepatitis E vaccine is not available yet in Hong Kong.
    

### Hepatitis C virus (HCV)

- **Virology of hepatitis C virus**
    
    hepatitis C virius is an enveloped RNA virus from the family flaviviridae.
    
    It pocesses a single-stranded RNA genome.
    
    It has key non-structural proteins including NS3/NS4A protease, NS5A/NS5B polymerase. These serve as drug targets.
    
    There is high mutation rate in antigenic sites, resulting in several genotypes, subgenotypes or recombinants.
    
- **Transmission of hepatitis C virus**
    
    Contrasting with HAV and HEV, which is mainly transmitted via the feco-oral route, HCV is involved in blood-borne transmission:
    
    - Sharing needles with infected individuals - *IV drug use is the most important risk factors of Hepatitis C*
    - Sharing of inadequately sterilised medical equipment - *Hepatitis C is known for its transmission in healthcare settings*
    - Blood product transfusion (rarely now as we screen for HCV)
    - Occupational exposure
    - Perinatal/ antenatal transmission (less common)
    - Sexual transmission (less common) - MSM
- **Clinical manifestations of HCV infections**
    
    In acute hepatitis C:
    
    - Most are assymptomatic, but 20-30% of infected individuals develop symptomatic acute hepatitis C.
    - 30% of individuals spontaneously clear the virus, while the remaining 70% become chronic HCV carriers.
    
    Chronic hepatitis C manifests as chronic hepatic fibrosis, Liver cirrhosis and can complicate with hepatocellular carcinoma.

- **Treatment of hepatitis C**
    
    In acute hepatitis C, supportive treatment is provided.
    
    Chronic hepatitis C can be **cured** with the use of direct acting antivirals (DAA).
    
- **Prevention of hepatitis C**
    
    No vaccination is available for HCV due to its rapid mutation rate in antigenic sites.
    

### Hepatitis B virus (HBV)

- **Virology of hepatitis B virus**
    
    HBV is an enveloped partially double-stranded DNA (the negative strand is complete, but the positive strand is not complete) virus.
    
    Its genome express certain proteins, such as HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen), HBcAg (Hepatitis B core antigen), Pol (Polymerase, also acts as a reverse transcriptase), HBeAg and HBx protein (unknown functions).
    
- **Viral replication cycle of hepatitis B virus**
    
    Viral attachment and entry - HBV binds to NTCP and enters hepatocytes.
    
    Viral uncoating - HBV sheds its envelop and releases its partially double-stranded DNA.
    
    HBV completes the double-stranded DNA, which is then converted into covalenty closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which can remain latent within hepatocytes for a long time.
    
    Viral protein synthesis - cccDNA is transcribed into mRNA for polymerase and structural proteins.
    
    Viral DNA replication - cccDNA is transcribed to give pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), where polymerase acts as a reverse transcriptase to produce the negative strand of genomic DNA. Polymerase further completes the double-stranded DNA.
    
    Viral assembly - Viral proteins and viral DNA assembly into mature virus.
    
    Viral release

- **Transmission of hepatitis B virus**
    
    HBV is involved in blood-borne transmission, but unlike HCV, vertical transmission (perinatal transmission) is more important than intravenous drug use:
    
    **In principle, Hepatitis B virus is transmitted by Birthing, Blood and Bonking.**
    
    - Perinatal transmission (exchange of fetal and maternal blood contact during childbirth) - *This is the most important route of transmission for hepatitis B virus.*
    - Breast feeding
    - Contact with infected blood and body fluids - in an occupational setting, household transmission, sharing needle with infected individuals (intravenous drug use), blood transfusion (very rare)
    - Sexual transmission
- **Clinical manifestation of HBV infections**
    
    In adults:
    
    - Individuals with acute hepatitis B may be asymptomatic, where as 30-60% of individuals are symptomatic.
    - Most adults spontaneous clear the infection and approach to convalescence.
    
    In infected neonates, infants or immunocomprimised hosts (rarely in adults), acute hepatitis will progress into chronic HBV infection/ chronic hepatitis B.
    
- **Diagnosis of acute hepatitis B**
    
    Laboratory hallmarks of acute hepatitis B include:
    
    - Positive HBsAg, HBV DNA, HBeAg, Anti-HBc
    
    During covalescence, usually after disappearance of HBsAg, individual would be positive for Anti-HBs and Anti-HBc for life.

- **Diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B**
    
    In general, the younger the age, the higher the chance of chronic infection.
    
    Laboratory diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is the persistance of HBsAg for more than 6 months.
    
    Other hallmarks include:
    
    - Positive HBeAg, positive HBV DNA and positive anti-HBc
    
    ![[IMG_1343.HEIC\|IMG_1343.HEIC]]
    
- **Diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B**
- **Complication of chronic hepatitis B**
    
    Sequelae of chronic hepatitis B is associated with:
    
    - Chronic active hepatitis (Flare ups or acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B)
    - Liver fibrosis
    - Liver cirrhosis and its related complications - Portal hypertension (associated with variceal bleeding, hypersplenism, ascites, hepato-renal syndrome etc.), Hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, acute flares of hepatitis, and death due to liver failure.
    - Hepatocellular carcinoma
- **Treatment of hepatitis B**
    
    For acute hepatitis B, symptomatic treatment is provided.
    
    Regular follow-up and monitoring for chronic hepatitis B is performed.
    
    Chronic HBV carriers may require treatments such as (Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors/ NRTIs) and pegylated interferons to reduce risk of complication.
    
- **Prevention of hepatitis B**
    
    Hepatitis B can be prevented by:
    
    - Hepatitis B vaccine (consisting of HBsAg) - Part of the childhood immunization program with 3 doses at 0, 6 and 12 months of life. It has excellent efficacy, but not 100%.
    - Hepatitis B immunoglobin - For neonates that may have contracted HBV at birth from an infected mother. It offers immediate, but short lasting protection.

### Hepatitis D virus (HDV)

- **Virology of hepatitis D virus**
    
    HDV is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA *defective* virus.
    
    It has a core HDAg, and requires HBsAg from HBV.
    
- **Transmission of hepatitis D virus**
    
    Transmission of hepatitis D virus is mainly via exposure to blood or body fluids, such as IVDUs, body piercing and tattoos.
    
    Sexual transmission and perinatal transmission is also possible (but rare).
    
- **Clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus**
    
    HDV infection cannot occur without concomitant HBV infection, it may occur via:
    
    - Coinfection with HBV (95% cleared spontaneously)
    - Superinfection on top of hepatitis B (only 30% cleared spontaneously)
    
    Co-infected patients progress to cirrhosis faster than chronic hepatitis B alone.
