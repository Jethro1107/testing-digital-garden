### Reciprocal Regulation of Fatty Acid Synthesis and Fatty acid oxidation

- What are the two lipogenic organs?
    
    Liver, adipose tissue
    
- What are the different regulatory sites for controlling hepatic fatty acid synthesis in fed state?
    
    Conversion between Fructose-6-Phosphate and Fructose-1,6,-bisphosphate (glycolysis)
    
    Conversion between Phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate (glycolysis)
    
    Conversion between pyruvate and acetyl-CoA
    
    **Fatty acid synthesis and beta-oxidation of fatty acid**
    
- How is extent of fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation regulated in fed state/fast state?
    
    **Acetyl-CoA is converted into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in fatty acid synthesis**
    
    Fed state:
    
    Under fed state, high insulin:glucagon ratio renders ACC unphosphorylated, which is active
    
    Hence, most ACC is in active state
    
    More acetyl-CoA is converted into malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis
    
    Malonyl-CoA also inhibits the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation of fatty acid, thus reducing fatty acid oxidation
    
    Hence, this promotes net fatty acid synthesis after a meal
    
    Fast state:
    
    Under fast state, low insulin:glucagon ratio promotes the gluconeogenic pathway, such that less pyruvate, and hence, less acetyl-CoA is formed
    
    Low insulin:glucagon ratio renders ACC phosphorylated, which is inactive
    
    Hence, most ACC is in inactive state
    
    Less acetyl-CoA is converted into malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis
    
    As there is less malonyl-CoA formed, this promotes the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria due to the removed inhibition effect, promoting fatty acid oxidation
    
    Hence, this promotes net fatty acid oxidation after a meal
    
- How is extent of fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation regulated in skeletal muscles during exercise?
    
    Fatty acid synthesis in skeletal muscle is non-existent due to the lack of fatty acid synthase
    
    Yet, acetyl-CoA is still converted to malonyl-CoA under the action of ACC for regulation of beta-oxidation
    
    During exercise, ATP is converted to AMP to power contractions, resulting in the increase of AMP levels
    
    Increase in AMP levels increases protein kinase activities, causing phosphorylation and inactivation of ACC
    
    Less acetyl-CoA is converted to Malonyl-CoA, thus promoting transport of fatty acids into mitochondria by removing the inhibitory effect of malonyl-CoA
    
    Beta oxidation is promoted
    
- Discuss Rhabdomyolysis. What is the cause of rhabdomyolysis?
    
    The breakdown of skeletal muscle fibres due to insufficient energy provided from glycogen and lipid metabolism
    
    The release of myoglobin into blood, which would cause kidney damage
    
    Either from very vigorous exercise, or involve enzymatic defects in glycogen metabolism and lipid metabolism
    

### Reciprocal Regulation of Lipogenesis and Lipolysis

- How is lipolysis regulated in adipocytes in fast state?
    
    Lipolysis is regulated by lipase, which is active in phosphorylated state
    
    low insulin:glucagon ratio, results in high cAMP levels in blood, activating cAMP-dependent protein kinases, which would phosphorylated and activate hormone-sensitive lipase
    
    HSL breaks down TAG into Glycerol and fatty acid, released in blood and shuttled to liver and peripheral tissues
    
- Give a summary in glucose homeostasis in fed state. Why is it significant?
    
    Surplus glucose can be converted to glycogen and for fatty acid synthesis
    
    It is significance as it avoids excessively high levels of glucose which may result in direct reaction between glucose with other macromolecules
    
    These non-enzyme mediated glycation are the pathogenic basis for diabetic complications
    
- State the different processes promoted in liver in fast state.
    1. Glycogenolysis - increase blood glucose level
    2. Gluconeogenesis - increase blood glucose level
    3. Lipolysis (due to phosphorylation of lipase) - provide alternate fuel molecule and reduce usage of glucose by cells
    4. Fatty acid oxidation (due to phosphorylation of ACC) - provide alternate fuel molecule and reduce use of glucose by cells
    5. Ketone bodies synthesis - provide alternative fuel molecule
- How is ketone bodies production self regulated?
    
    Increased ketone bodies levels would stimulate pancreas to increase secretion of insulin, which would down regulate lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, thus preventing ketoacidosis
    
- How may type I diabetes mellitus cause diabetic ketoacidosis?
    
    Due to pancreatic cell loss, the the pancreas has impairment in its response to ketone bodies, resulting in uncontrolled lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, causing diabetic ketoacidosis
    
- State the different mechanisms for gluconeogenesis is achieved in the liver.
    
    Glycerol in lipolysis
    
    Glucose-alanine cycle
    
- Briefly explain the function of glucose fatty acid cycle.
    
    Fatty acid and its derivatives reduce the usage of glucose as fuel molecules
    
- What are the causes of type II diabetes mellitus?
    
    Partial loss of insulin receptor function
    
    Loss of glucose and fatty acid homeostasis - High blood glucose level and fatty acid level, fatty acid prevents the utilization of glucose by glucose fatty acid cycle
    
- Why is enzyme important for diagnosis?
    
    Enzymes have specific locations in the body
    
    Detecting enzymes in blood allows us to understand where tissue damage is present
