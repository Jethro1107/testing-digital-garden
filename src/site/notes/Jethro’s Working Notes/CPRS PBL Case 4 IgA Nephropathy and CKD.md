### LO I.3: Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease are different clinical entities and have different Etiologies

Acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease differ in the disease course and causes.

Acute kidney injury refers to the rapid decline in renal functions (within hours or days).

Causes of acute kidney injury:

Prerenal - Ischaemia (due to shock)

Intrarenal cause - Glomerulonephritis, Tubulointerstitial disease (ATI, tubulointerstitial nephritis)

Postrenal cause - Acute urinary retention

Chronic kidney disease refers to kidney damage or persistent decline in renal functions (GFR<60ml/min/1.73m2) for 3 months

Cause of chronic kidney disease:

Diabetic nephropathy

Hypertensive nephropathy

Chronic glomerulonephritis

Vascular disease

Polycystic kidney disease

### LO I.4: Common investigations for patients presenting with abnormal renal functions

Urinalysis - RBC, Protein, Glucose

Blood test - Electrolytes, acid-base, haemoglobin, urea and creatinine, liver enzymes

CKD-EPI - minmax Cr, age, gender, ethnicity

MDMR - SCr, gender, ethnicity

CockRoft and gault - SCr, gender age body weight

Ultrasonogram - Kidney size

### LO I.5: Certain biochemical and haematological investigation results point towards renal disease

Electrolyte imbalance:

Dilutional hyponatremia

Hyperkalemia

Hyperphosphatemia

Hypocalcemia

Acid-base imbalance:

Metabolic acidosis (manifested as low bicarbonate)

Azotemia:

Elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine

Decreased albumin:

Pointing towards a nephrotic picture

Anaemia:

Due to decreased erythropoetin production

### LO II.1: Psychosocial implications of chronic kidney disease

Psychological implications of chronic kidney disease - Intense emotions towards illness (fear)

Social implications - Chronic kidney disease may affect work and employment, and disrupt family life (shift in family roles)

### LO IV.1: Renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients raises many ethicolegal considerations

In Hong Kong, the three available renal replacement therapy are 1) Peritoneal dialysis, 2) Haemodialysis and 3) Kidney transplant

Some ethicolegal considerations are raised:

1. Organ trade is illegal
2. Family members may be pressured to perform living related transplantation
3. Allocation of available organs
