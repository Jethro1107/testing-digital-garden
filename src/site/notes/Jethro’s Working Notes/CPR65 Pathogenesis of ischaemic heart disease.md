### Anatomy and physiology of myocardium and IHD

- Anatomy of myocardium
    
    
    - **Histological features of myocardium**
        - Thickest layer of the heart wall, consisting of:
            - Cardiac muscles
            - Extensive vasculature

    - Cardiac muscles as a syncytium
        - **Why is cardiac muscle described as a syncytium?**
            - Cardiac muscles constitute of many cardiac muscle cells interconnected via intercalated disk, forming an electrical and mechanical syncytium
        - **Importance of cardiac muscles as a syncytium**
            - Electrical connection - Intercalated disks consist of gap junctions that permit a single action potential produced by a pacemaker cell to propagate throughout the heart, allowing the heart to contract in a synchronized and wave-like manner
            - Mechanical connection - Intercalated disks consist of desmosomes that form strong cell-cell adhesions via cadherin, holding cardiac muscle cells together during contraction
    - Vascular supply of the myocardium
        - **3 major epicardial coronary arteries**
            - 1. Left anterior descending artery /LAD (anterior interventricular artery of left coronary trunk)
                - **Areas of perfusion of left anterior descending artery**
                    
                    Left anterior descending artery supplies:
                    
                    The apex of the heart
                    
                    The anterior surface of the left ventricle
                    
                    Anterior two thirds of interventricular septum
                    
                    AV bundle branches

            - 2. Circumflex artery (LCX of left coronary trunk)
                - **Areas of perfusion of circumflex artery**
                    
                    Circumflex artery supplies:
                    
                    The lateral wall of the left ventricle
                    
            - 3. Right coronary artery/RCA
                - **Areas of perfusion of right coronary artery**
                    
                    Right coronary artery supplies:
                    
                    Right atrium and right ventricle
                    
                    Posterior third of interventricular septum
                    
                    Posterior-basal part of left ventricle

        - **Branches of epicardial coronary arteries**
            
            Epicardial coronary arteries run along their epicardial route and form multiple penetrating branches into the myocardium as intramural arteries
            
        
        - **Effects on systole on coronary blood flow in the 2 periods of a heart beat**
            - During systole, coronary vessels (intramural arteries) are compressed, resulting in decreased blood flow in systole
            - Hence, coronary blood flow is higher in diastole

        - **Effects of heart rate on diastolic time and its physiological significance**
            
            Increase in heart rate results in decreased diastolic time, which shortens time for coronary perfusion
            
            This serves as a protective mechanism to prevent the heart from working too fast for too long

            Note: While diastolic time is reduced, an increased heart rate results in decreased PO2 and adenosine production, causing vasodilation and thus a net increase in coronary perfusion

- Ischaemic heart disease (IHD)
    - **What is ischaemic heart disease?**
        
        Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is a broad term encompassing several closely related cardiac syndromes caused by myocardial ischaemia - an imbalance between cardiac blood supply (perfusion) and myocardial demand
        
        Ref: [[Robbins  Ischaemic heart disease - definition and manifestations\|Robbins  Ischaemic heart disease - definition and manifestations]] 
        
    - **What are the causes of ischaemic heart disease?**
        
        In more than 90% of the cases, IHD is a consequence of reduced coronary blood flow secondary to obstructive atherosclerotic vascular disease, thus unless otherwise specified, IHD is synonymous with coronary artery disease (CAD)
        
        In the remaining case, IHD is a consequence of:
        
        Increased demand (e.g. Hypertrophy, hypertension, increased heart rate)
        
        Diminished blood volume (e.g. shock, hypotension)
        
        Diminished oxygenation (e.g. Chronic heart failure CHF, pneumonia)
        
        Diminished oxygen carrying capacity (e.g. CO poisoning, anemia)
        
    - **What are the common clinical manifestations of ischaemic heart disease?**
        
        Clinical manifestation may include one or more of the following cardiac syndrome:
        
        1. Angina pectoris - Ischemia-induced chest pain but is insufficient to cause myocardial death, classified into stable and unstable angina
        2. Myocardial infarction - occurs when severity or duration of ischemia is sufficient to cause myocardiocyte death
        3. Chronic IHD with CHF - progressive cardiac decompensation occuring after MI or secondary to accuulation of small ischaemic insult, precipitated into heart failure
        4. Sudden cardiac death - occurs as a result of tissue damage in MI, but more commonly of a lethal cardiac arrhythmia
        
        The term acute coronary syndrome applies to any three of the catastrophic manifestation of IHD:
        
        1. Unstable angina
        2. MI (STEMI and NSTEMI)
        3. SCD
        
        Ref: [[Robbins  Ischaemic heart disease - definition and manifestations\|Robbins  Ischaemic heart disease - definition and manifestations]] 
        

### Pathogenesis of IHD

- **Pathogenesis of IHD syndromes**
    
    IHD is a consequence of diminished coronary perfusion relative to myocardial demand, usually a consequence of atherosclerotic occlusion of one of the three major epicardial arteries, with superimposed thrombosis, and/or vasospasm
    
    Fixed atherosclerotic narrowings of less than 75% is assymptomatic, even in exertion
    
    Atherosclerotic lesions that occlude more than 75% of the vessel lumen (so called ‘critical stenosis’), causes insufficent perfusion in increased demand, results in typical presentation of angina pectoris on exertion, and the patient is said to have stable angina
    
    Atherosclerotic lesion that causes 90% stenosis can cause insufficient coronary perfusion at rest, and the patient is said to have unstable angina
    
    Cf: [[Robbins  Pathogenesis of IHD\|Robbins  Pathogenesis of IHD]] 
    
- **Triggers for IHD to manifest as acute coronary syndrome**
    
    Other than the severity of fixed atherosclerotic stenosis, acute plaque change is another trigger for myocardial ischaemia, causing IHD, which is often manifested as acute coronary syndrome
    
    Acute plaque change:
    
    Rupture, fissuring, erosion or ulceration of plaque exposes thrombogenic constituents of the plaque, triggering thrombosis
    
    Plaque rupture may also cause plaque hemorrhage, causing volume expansion
    
    This results in partial or complete occlusion, resulting in ischaemic injury or infarction
    
    Acute plaque change results in unstable angina, MI and SCD, thus is a culprit of acute coronary syndrome> 
    
    Cf: [[Robbins  Pathogenesis of IHD\|Robbins  Pathogenesis of IHD]] 
    

### Clinical presentation of IHD

- Angina pectoris
    - **What is angina pectoris?**
        
        Angina pectoris is the paroxymal, recurrent substernal and precordial chest pain caused by transient, reversible myocardial ischemia that  is insufficient to cause myocyte necrosis that defines myocardial infarction
        
    
    - **Classification of angina**
        - Stable angina (typical angina)
            - **What is stable angina?**
                
                Stable angina is the most common form of angina
                
                It is a predictable episodic chest pain associated with particular levels of exertion or some other cause of increased myocardial demand
                
            - **Clinical features of stable angina**
                
                Crushing, squeezing substernal sensation, chest tightness, where pain radiates to the left arm or left jaw (referred pain)
                
            - **Major cause of stable angina**
                
                Fixed atherosclerotic stenosis (>75% stenosis)
                
            - **Relieve of stable angina**
                
                Rest (reducing demand)
                
                Vasodilators (e.g. CCBs)
                
        - Unstable angina (cresendo angina)
            - **What is unstable angina?**
                
                Unstable angina is characterised by patterns of increasingly frequent, prolonged chest pains, precipitated by lesser extent of exertion and even occuring at rest
                
            - **Major cause of unstable angina**
                
                Associated with disruption of atherosclerotic plaque, superimposed thrombosis, embolization of thrombus and/or vasospasm, resulting in an incommplete occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery

        - Variant angina (Vasospastic/prinzmetal angina)
            - **What is variant angina?**
                
                Variant/Vasospastic/prinzmetal angina is an uncommon form of angina that occurs at rest
                
            - **Major cause of variant angina**
                
                Caused by coronary artery spasm

- Myocardial infarction

### Diagnosis and management of myocardial infarction

- **Myocardial response to ischaemia**
    
    Biochemical changes (within seconds) - ATP depletion
    
    Ultrastructural/functional changes (2 minutes) - Loss of contractility
    
    Irreversible injury (20-40 minutes after onset of ischaemia) - Coagulative necrosis of myocytes
    
    Microvascular injury (>1 hour) - Microvascular thrombosis

**Principle of diagnosis of myocardial infarction: detection of myocyte death**

- **Diagnostic tools for MI**
    - Electrocardiogram (ECG)
    - Laboratory test
    - Echocardiogram
    - Coronary angiography
    - Radioisotope studies
    - Magnetic resonance imaging
- **Interventions of MI**
    
    Coronary angiogram - balloon and stenting
    
    Coronary bypass surgery - used only when atherosclerotic lesion is highly calcified
    

### Consequence of myocardial infarction

- **Microscopic changes of myocardial infarct**
    
    4-12 hours: Early coagulative necrosis, edema and hemorrhage
    
    12-24 hours: Pyknosis of nucleus, hyper eosinophilia, neutrophil infiltration
    
    1-3 days: Coagnulative necrosis with karyolysis (loss of nuclei), neutrophil infiltration
    
    > 2 months: Repair, deposition of dense collagenous scar tissue
    
- **Progression of infarct caused by occlusion of epicardial arteries**
    
    Infarct first occur at subendocardial zone, and extends outwards to involve the entire wall thickness
