### Myasthesia gravis

**Myasthesia gravis** is an autoimmune neuromuscular junction ([[Neuromuscular junction is highly specialised in terms of its physiological anatomy\|Neuromuscular junction is highly specialised in terms of its physiological anatomy]]) disorder.

- ******************************************************************Pathogenesis of myasthesia gravis******************************************************************
    
    Myasthesia gravis is caused by the production of autoantibodies, commonly Anti-AChR autoantibodies, but also Anti-Lrp4 autoantibodies and Anti-MuSK autoantibodies ([[Innervation inducts AChR clustering at junctional folds\|Innervation inducts AChR clustering at junctional folds]]).
    
    Anti-AChR autoantibodies mediate its effects in 3 ways:
    
    1. Activation of MAC, resulting in disruption of post-synaptic membrane structure.
    2. Endocytosis of AChR, resulting in a decrease in density of AChR clusters.
    3. Inhibition of channel functions of AChR, thus preventing depolarization of sarcolemma.

- ********************************************************Clinical course of myasthesia gravis********************************************************
    
    It is characterised with progressive muscle weakness which follows a similar course:
    
    1. Occular symptoms (eyelid drooping, blurred or double vision, difficulty in controlling eyeball movement)
    2. Oral symptoms
    3. Generalised muscle weakness (in the limbs and trunk).
- ******************************Treatment of myasthesia gravis******************************
    1. AChE inhibitors
        
        e.g. Pyridostigmine
        
        AChE inhibitors inhibit AChE, which enables ACh to remain with the synaptic cleft for a longer time.
        
    2. Immunosuppressant therapy
    3. Intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG) againts pathogenic antibodies.
