The lumbricals insert on the lateral side of the base proximal phalanx, and also to the extensor expansion on the dorsal side.

- ******************************************************Movements of the lumbricals******************************************************
    
    The lumbricals flex the metacarpophalangial joints of the 2nd to 5th digits, while simutaneous extend the interphalangeal joints (due to its association with the extension expansion).
    
    It integrates the actions of flexors and extensors for fine coordination of finger movements.
