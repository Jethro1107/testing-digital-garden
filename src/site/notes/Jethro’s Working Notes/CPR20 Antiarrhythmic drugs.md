### Pathophysiology of arrhythmia

- Regulation of normal cardiac rhythm
    - **Origin of a heart beat (cardiac muscle contraction)**
        - Originates from the intrinsic initiation and conduction of action potentials of pacemaker cells in the cardiac conduction system
    - **Mechanisms for regulation of pacemaker activity**
        - Changing rate of spontaneous depolarization
        - Changing threshold for action potential generation
        - Changing maximum diastolic potential
    - **Mechanisms of regulation of impulse propagation**
        - Altering magnitude of depolarizing current (activity of Na+ channels, or Ca2+ channels)
        - Geometry of cell-cell connection:
            - More gap junctions at the end of the cells rather than side of cells, allowing impulse propagation along the cell to be faster than across the cell

- Arrhythmia
    - **Definition of cardiac arrhythmia/ disrhythmia**
        - Disturbance of normal cardiac (sinus) rhythm
    - **Two major mechanisms of arrhythmia**
        - Abnormal automaticity (rate and regularity) in pacemaker or other sites:
            - Tachycardia - increase in heart rate (above 100 bpm)
            - Bradycardia - decrease in heart rate (below 60bpm)
            - Fibrillation - uncoordinated depolarization and contraction
        - Abnormal impulse conduction:
            - Change in conduction velocity
            - Blockade of impulse conduction
            - Can occur anywhere in the heart, atrial, ventricle or junctional
    - Abnormal automaticity
        - Abnormal automaticity of pacemaker
            - **Mechanisms for abnormal automaticity of pacemaker cells**
                - Reduced maximal membrane potential due to decreased potassium conductance (resulting resting potential to be more depolarized)
                    - Enhanced by increased sympathetic activity
                    - Enhanced decreased extracellular K levels (hypokalemia)
        - Abnormal automaticity in other sites: Afterdepolarization/triggered activity
            - **Two types of afterdepolarizations**
                - Early afterdepolarizations (EAD)
                    - **Cause and occurence of early afterdepolarizations**
                        - Early afterdepolarization may occur when there is a prolonged repolarization period of the action potential
                        - This can be due to:
                            - Reduced repolarizing potassium current
                            - Increased inward Ca current
                            - Increased Na-Ca exchange activity
                            - Increased Na current
                    - **Phases of action potential when early afterdepolarization can occur**
                        - Phase 2 - Plateau phase
                        - Phase 3 - repolarization phase
                    - **Ionic basis of triggered early afterdepolarization and effects**
                        - Due to prolonged repolarization period of action potential, L-type Ca2+ channels has had a chance to recover from inactivation, resulting in an inward Ca current that cause a positive deflection of membrane potential, known as an early afterdepolarization
                        - Such EAD may trigger may trigger extrasystole, or premature ventricular contraction

                - [Delayed afterdepolarizations (DAD)](https://www.remnote.com/doc/xoifX68E7d47pX6HP)
                    - **Cause of delayed afterdepolarization**
                        - Increase in intracellular Ca levels
                    - **Phases of action potential when delayed afterdepolarization can occur**
                        - After full repolarization, during phase 4
                    - **Ionic basis of triggered delayed afterdepolarization and effects**
                        - Ca2+ overload may trigger the activity of Na-Ca exchanger to pump 1 Ca2+ ion out in exchange for 3 Na+ ion, resulting in a transient inward current that depolarizes the membrane, forming the delayed afterdepolarization
                        - Delayed afterdepolarization raise membrane potential past threshold and produce a spontaneous action potential
    - [Abnormal impulse conduction](https://www.remnote.com/doc/z6ZrqgAMdYwgcgBqh)
        - **Types of conduction abnormalities**
            - Simple block of impulse conduction
                - **Most common location of conduction blocks**
                    - AV node
                - **Types of conduction blocks**
                    - [Partial (or Incomplete) Conduction Block](https://www.remnote.com/doc/FWepWGxcX3doTjKAP) - First-degree block, second-degree block
                    - [Complete Conduction Block](https://www.remnote.com/doc/RzausbemTPZLAcDEw) - third-degree block

            - [Re-Entry](https://www.remnote.com/doc/2X9ppc5ixZm9hhkH8)
                - **3 requirements for re-entry**
                    - A closed conduction loop
                    - A unidirectional block
                    - A slow conduction of action potential around the loop
                - **Mechanism for re-entry**
                    - Impulse travels down purkinje fibres which bifurcate and reach a group of myocyte, forming a closed conduction loop
                    - Due to unilateral block, the action potential travels down the unblocked branch, stimulating the distal conducting cells, leaving them in effective refractory period
                    - Action potential reaches the group of myocardiocytes, causing them to contract
                    - Action potential reaches the damaged branch, and travels in a retrograde fashion and again reaches the region bifurcation
                    - As time has passed, the unblocked branch has recovered from the refractory period and can be depolarized, such that the action potential can travel in an antrograde fashion down the unblocked branch (as well as a retrograde fashion up the purkinje fibres), establishing circus movement

                - Torsades de Pointes (Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia)
                    - **Cause of torsades de Pointes**
                        - Early afterdepolarization, which trggers functioning re-entry, oweing to the heterogenity of the duration of refractory period on ventricular wall
    - **Classification of cardiac arrhythmias**
        - Suproventricular arrhythmia - atrial arrhythmia and nodal arrhythmia
        - Ventricular arrhythmia
    - **Causes of cardiac arrhythmia**
        - Ischaemia - reduce ion channel activity
        - Hypoxia - reduce ion channel activity
        - Electrolyte imbalance e.g. hypokalemia - affects ion channel activity
        - Autonomic influence - affect pacemaker activity
        - Drugs e.g. digoxin - cause electrolyte imbalance
        - Infection
    - **Therapeutic goals of antiarrhythmic drugs**
        - Termination of ongoing arrhythmia (intravenous administration)

### Vaughan-Williams classification of antiarrhythmic drugs

- Class I drugs
    - **What are class I drugs?**
        - Na channel blockers
    - **Characteristic of Na channels**
        - Na channels have 2 gates:
            - M gate - Open in open state and inactivated state (refractory state)
            - h gate (inactivation gate) - Open in resting and open state
            - Resting (fully repolarized) - m gate close, h gate open Open - m gate and h gate open Inactivated - m gate open, h gate close
                
                ![https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/TqFBjv1Kbr_KyA6b0de9Qz8aQ8PIsW5MstOLyiuDSBspmEwGdrmTpb5TSyLiKOSIpCaOwEWH_iJA2Eogleof1uMURRCoLPtau2_oBXk3i_SDbo7zYecBZNso4tzb-djc.png](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/TqFBjv1Kbr_KyA6b0de9Qz8aQ8PIsW5MstOLyiuDSBspmEwGdrmTpb5TSyLiKOSIpCaOwEWH_iJA2Eogleof1uMURRCoLPtau2_oBXk3i_SDbo7zYecBZNso4tzb-djc.png)
                
    - **Characteristic and function of Class I drugs**
        - Na channel blockers bind preferentially to Na channels in open or inactivated state, and less readily when the Na channels when it is fulling repolarized and resting
            - Hence, the more frequent the Na channels are activated (open m gate), the greater the degree the block
            - Hence, it binds preferentially to abnormal tissue rather than normal tissue

        - Cautions in ventricular tachycardia, as may result in hypotention and cardiac arrest
- Miscellaneous antiarrhythmic drugs
    - Adenosine
        - **MOA of adenosine**
            
            Activates presynaptic purigenic receptors of sympathetic nerves, causing decrease in release in NE, thus decreasing automaticity
            
            Activates A1 receptors on SA node and AV node, inhibiting adenyl cyclase activity, resulting in decreased cAMP production, causing decreased automaticity and conduction velocity
            
            It also prevents calcium overload
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Activates potassium channels in SA node and AV node, thus causing maximal diastolic potential to further decrease (more hyperpolarized), thus decreasing automaticity and conduction velocity
            
        - **Adverse effects of adenosine**
            
            Adenosine is a vasodilator, resulting in flushing and hypotension
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Chest pains and shortness of breath
            
        - **Duration of action of adenosine**
            
            Rapid uptake by cells for metabolism, such that there is a short half life in blood
            
    - Cardiac glycosides
        - **Example of cardiac glycosides**
            
            Digoxin
            
        - **MOA of cardiac glycosides**
            
            Parasympathomimetic activity
            
            Decrease heart rate, decreased conduction velocity
            
        
        - **Adverse effects of cardiac glycosides**
            
            Proarrhythmic:
            
            Decreased activity of Na+/K+ exchange pump, causing accumulation of Na in the cell
            
            Decreased Ca2+ expulsion out of cell by Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, or even reverse it
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Results in intracellular Ca2+ overload, increasing risk of delayed after depolarization
            
            GI disturbance
            
            CNS disturbance
            
            Narrow safety margin
            
    - Atropine
        - **MOA of atropine**
            
            Acts as a muscurinic receptor antagonist, thus reducing vagal influence
            
            This results in increased heart rate and increased conduction velocity
            
        - **Adverse effects of atropine**
            
            All due to decreased parasympathetic influence
            
            Tachycardia
            
            Pupil dilation
            
            Dry mouth
