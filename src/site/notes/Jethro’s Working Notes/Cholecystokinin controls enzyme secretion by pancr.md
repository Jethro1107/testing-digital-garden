### Cholecystokinin controls enzyme secretion by pancreatic acinar cells in the intestinal phase

Cholecystokinin is released by I cells in the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa under the presence of long chain fatty acids and amino acids (or partially digested products of proteins).

Cholecystokinin travels via the bloodstream and activates the Ca2+ intracellular signalling pathway in pancreatic acinar cells. This accounts for 70-80% of pancreatic enzyme secretions ([[Pancreatic acinar cells release a list of digestive enzymes upon stimulation\|Pancreatic acinar cells release a list of digestive enzymes upon stimulation]]).
