### NSAID

退燒， 止痛，消炎

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, are a class of drugs that have anti-inflammatory effects, antipyretic effects and analgesic effect (also an anti-platelet drug in aspirin).

- ************************MOA of NSAID************************
    
    NSAID inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX1/2), thus inhibiting prostanoid synthesis, where [[Prostanoid lies central to the inflammatory response\|Prostanoid lies central to the inflammatory response]].
    
    Inhibition of prostanoid synthesis results in anti-inflammatory effects:
    
    - Inhibition of prostacyclin (PGI2) by endothelial cells results in reduced vasodilation, resulting in reduced blood flow and hence reduced ‘redness’ and ‘heat’.
    - Inhibition prostaglandin synthesis results in reduced vascular permeability that is induced by histamine and bradykinin, resulting in reduced exudation and hence reduced ‘swelling’.
    
    Inhibition of prostanoid synthesis results in antipyretic effects:
    
    - Inhibition of prostaglandin E2 results in lowering of thermoregulatory set point due to reduced effect on the thermoregulatory centre, thus achieving a antipyretic effect.
    
    Inhibition of prostanoid synthesis results in analgesic effects:
    
    - Inhibition of prostaglandin production prevents the potentiation of pain production by bradykinin. Hence, NSAID can be considered as a [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Non-opioid analgesics\|Non-opioid analgesics]].
- **********************************************Adverse effects of NSAID**********************************************
    - Gastrointestinal disturbance (as [[Prostaglandin regulates gastrointestinal functions in the stomach\|Prostaglandin regulates gastrointestinal functions in the stomach]])
        - It may result in dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
        - Chronic users may develop [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peptic ulcer\|Peptic ulcer]]
        
        Hence, NSAID is generally contraindicated in those with high GI risk, especially those with gastric ulcers.
        
    - Risk of bleeding due to impaired platelet function (Hence, [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Aspirin is used as an anti-platelet drug\|Aspirin is used as an anti-platelet drug]]).
        
        Inhibition of COX results in inhibition of thromboxane A2 production in platelets, which induces GpIIb/IIIa complex, that is required for binding to fibrinogen.
        
        Hence, this inhibits platelet aggregation.
        
    - Skin reactions - Rashes, photosensitivity reactions, urticaria
    - Renal insufficiency
        
        Inhibition of prostaglandin production results in constriction of afferent arterioles, resulting in reduced renal blood flow.
        
        Generally, other mechanisms such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated to maintain blood flow. But in susceptible individuals, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is already over-activated, the decrease in prostaglandin production cannot be compensated, resulting in decrease in renal blood flow.
        
        In chronic users, **********analgesic-associated nephropathy********** is ************************irreversible************************.
        
    - Liver disorders (rare)
    - Bronchospasm (rare)
        
        Inhibition of cycloxygenase pathway results in a metabolic shift to the lipoxygenase pathway. This results in increase in leukotriene production.
        
        Leukotriene stimulates bronchospasm.
        
- **************************************Precaution of NSAID**************************************
    - Increased adverse effects in elderly, due to reduced liver and renal functions
    - Avoided in pregnancy, especially when close to term, as it impairs fetal circulation and increases risk of postpartum haemorrhage.
    - Pre-existing conditions
        - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peptic ulcer\|Peptic ulcer]]
        - Renal disease ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/CPR87 Disease of the kidney II\|CPR87 Disease of the kidney II]])
        - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cirrhosis\|Cirrhosis]]
        - Asthma ([[CPR54  Pathology of small airway diseases\|CPR54  Pathology of small airway diseases]])
    - Concurrent medication
        - Blood thinners (e.g. Heparin and Warfarin) - increases risk of bleeding
        - ACE inhibitors [[Jethro’s Working Notes/EditLater\|EditLater]]
        - Protein bound drugs (Sulphonylurea hypoglycemic agents, warfarin), resulting in increased plasma drug levels and adverse effects
        - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug\|Glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug]]  (increase in risk of GI bleeding)
    - Discontinue NSAID for a period of time (5 times the half life of NSAID) to reduce risk of bleeding.

### Classification of NSAID and comparison of their effects

- ************************************************************************************************************************************NSAIDS can be classified by chemical structures and COX selectivity************************************************************************************************************************************
    1. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Salicylate\|Salicylate]] - Aspirin (associated with salicylate toxicity), Diflunasil (No salicylate toxicity)
    2. Propionic acid - Ibuprofen, naproxen (relatively more COX-2 selective, associated with lesser adverse effects than aspirin)
    3. Acetic acid - Indomethacin, solindac, tolmetin
    4. Oxicams - Piroxicam
    5. Fenamate - Meclofenamic
    6. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Selective COX-2 inhibitors\|Selective COX-2 inhibitors]] - Celecoxib, Rofecoxib, Etoricoxib
