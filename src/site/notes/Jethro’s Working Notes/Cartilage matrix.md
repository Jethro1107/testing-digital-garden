### Cartilage matrix

Cartilage matrix consist of 3 components: 45% Type 2 collagen (insoluble fibres), 45% [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans\|Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans]] and some glycoproteins .

Hence, there is a balance of tensile strength, and compressive resistance afforded by cartilage.

Type 2 collagen also provides a network that resist the swelling pressure of the HA-aggrecan aggregates.
