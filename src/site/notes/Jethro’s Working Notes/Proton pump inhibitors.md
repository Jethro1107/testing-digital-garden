### Proton pump inhibitors in the treatment of peptic ulcers

- **Examples of proton pump inhibitors**
    
    Omeprazole, Esomeprazole, Lansoprazole, Pantoprazole, Rabeprazole
    
- **MOA of proton pump inhibitors**
    
    PPIs directly inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase on parietal cells, thus inhibiting gastric acid secretion.
    
    As it targets the end point of the signalling pathway, it is more effecting than [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/H2 antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcers\|H2 antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcers]] and [[Muscarinic antagonists in treatment of peptic ulcers\|Muscarinic antagonists in treatment of peptic ulcers]].
    
- **Adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors**
    
    Proton pump inhibitors are generally well tolerated. Mild side effects include:
    
    - Headaches, dizziness
    - GI disturbance
