### Diagnosis

Diagnosis is the process of ********determining the health status and the factors for producing it******** with the application of tests, examinations or other procedures.

- **************************************************************************************************************************************************In terms of validity, diagnostic tests generally favour specificity over sensitivity**************************************************************************************************************************************************
    
    This is often because we want to rule out a specific diagnosis.
    
- ****************To access the performance (technicality) of a diagnostic test****************
    
    [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Likelihood ratio\|Likelihood ratio]] can be used to accessed the ability of test to rule in or rule out a diagnosis.
    

While one might want to immediately rule in (or rule out) a diagnostic upon receiving diagnostic test result, a preliminary step to that would be accessing the post-test probability. [[There are different methods of appraising post-test probability after the application of diagnostic tests\|There are different methods of appraising post-test probability after the application of diagnostic tests]].
