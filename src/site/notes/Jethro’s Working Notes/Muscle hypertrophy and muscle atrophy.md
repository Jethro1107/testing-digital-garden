### Muscle hypertrophy and muscle atrophy

- ************************************Muscle hypertrophy************************************
    
    Muscle hypertrophy occurs when there is repeated stimulation to produce near-maximal tension.
    
    There is an increase in fusion of myosatellite cells, increased protein synthesis, and reduced protein degradation.
    
    This results in an increase in number of thick and thin filaments in myofibrils, as well as increase in mitochondria number, higher concentration of glycolytic enzymes and a larger glycogen reserve.
    
- ****************************Muscle atrophy****************************
    
    Muscle atrophy occurs when muscles is not regularly stimulated, resulting in a reduction of muscle size.
