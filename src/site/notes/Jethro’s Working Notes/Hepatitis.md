### Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver

### Acute hepatitis

Clinical features of acute hepatitis is similar irrespective of cause:

- Jaundice - Yellowing of skin and sclera
- Maliase
- Anorexia
- **Etiology of acute hepatitis**
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Viral Hepatitis\|Viral Hepatitis]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Alcoholic liver disease\|Alcoholic liver disease]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Drug-induced hepatitis\|Drug-induced hepatitis]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Autoimmune hepatitis\|Autoimmune hepatitis]]
    - Metabolic diseases (e.g. Wilson’s disease)
    - Non-hepatitis viruses
- **Histopathology of acute hepatitis**
    
    When hepatocytes undergo irreversible injury, they die by either necrosis (usually in ischemic injury or severe chronic viral hepatitis) and apoptosis (more common in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Viral Hepatitis\|Viral Hepatitis]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Drug-induced hepatitis\|Drug-induced hepatitis]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Autoimmune hepatitis\|Autoimmune hepatitis]]).
    
    - When hepatocytes die by apoptosis, acidophilic bodies (apoptotic bodies) are formed.
    - Necrosis of hepatocytes is proceeds down a [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatic acinus\|Hepatic acinus]]. It begins in Zone 3, dropout of hepatocytes near the central vein (*Zonal necrosis*), then extends across the acinar zones (*Bridging necrosis*), until it involves the entire acinus (*Panacinar necrosis*).
    
    Scant mononuclear portal infiltrates may be observed, but can sometimes be absent.
    

### Chronic hepatitis

- **Etiology of chronic hepatitis**
    - Hepatitis viruses (HBV, HCV, HDV)
    - Alcohol liver disease
    - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
    - Drug-induced hepatitis
    - Autoimmune hepatitis
- **Histopathology of chronic hepatitis**
    
    Chronic hepatitis is a necro-inflammatory disease of the liver for more than 6 months.
    
    Histological hallmark of chronic hepatitis is the dense mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in portal tracts.
