## Innervation

The skin, muscles, and parietal peritoneum of the anterolateral abdominal wall are supplied by T7 to T12 and L1 spinal nerves. The anterior rami of these spinal nerves pass around the body, from posterior to anterior, in an inferomedial direction ( [Fig. 4.36](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0185) ). As they proceed, they give off a lateral cutaneous branch and end as an anterior cutaneous branch.

The intercostal nerves (T7 to T11) leave their intercostal spaces, passing deep to the costal cartilages, and continue onto the anterolateral abdominal wall between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles ( [Fig. 4.37](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0190)
 ). Reaching the lateral edge of the rectus sheath, they enter the rectus sheath and pass posterior to the lateral aspect of the rectus abdominis muscle. Approaching the midline, an anterior cutaneous branch passes through the rectus abdominis muscle and the anterior wall of the rectus sheath to supply the skin.

Spinal nerve T12 (the **subcostal nerve** ) follows a similar course as the intercostals. Branches of L1 (the **iliohypogastric nerve** and **ilio-inguinal nerve** ), which originate from the lumbar plexus, follow similar courses initially, but deviate from this pattern near their final destination.

Along their course, nerves T7 to T12 and L1 supply branches to the anterolateral abdominal wall muscles and the underlying parietal peritoneum. All terminate by supplying skin:

- Nerves T7 to T9 supply the skin from the xiphoid process to just above the umbilicus.
- T10 supplies the skin around the umbilicus.
- T11, T12, and L1 supply the skin from just below the umbilicus to, and including, the pubic region ( [Fig. 4.38](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0195) ).

- Additionally, the ilio-inguinal nerve (a branch of L1) supplies the anterior surface of the scrotum or labia majora, and sends a small cutaneous branch to the thigh.
