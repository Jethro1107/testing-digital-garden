### Diarrhoea

Diarrhoea is a common cause of death in developing countries, and is the 2nd leading cause of death under 5 years old worldwide.

- **WHO definition of diarrhoea**
    
    Diarrhea is defined as having 3 or more loose or liquid stools within 24 hours (an abnormal increase in stool liquidity and frequency).
    
    Daily stool weight exceeds 200g, where normally it is around 50g.
    
- **There are in general 4 causes of diarrhoea:**
    
    Diarrhea is caused by fluid secretion being greater than fluid absorption. There are 4 reasons as to why thats the case.
    
    1. Impaired absorption by small or large intestine
        
        [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Inflammatory bowel disease\|Inflammatory bowel disease]] such as Crohn’s disease results in impaired fluid absorption as a result of decreased expression of ENaC in the distal colon.
        
        Mucosal diseases such as Celiac disease (Gluten enteropathy) results in damage in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intestinal villi\|Intestinal villi]], resulting in a decrease in absorptive surface area in the small intestine.
        
    2. Secretory diarrhoea
        
        Viral or bacterial enteritis results in increased intestinal secretion, resulting in secretory diarrhoea/ infectious diarrhoea.
        
        Cholera toxin binds to receptors on crypt cells, which results in elevation of cAMP levels. This activates a tremendous number of CFTR, causing excess secretion of Cl- ions. [[Fluid secretion by crypt cells is mediated by a Cl- dependent mechanism\|Fluid secretion by crypt cells is mediated by a Cl- dependent mechanism]].
        
    3. Osmotic diarrhea
        
        The presence of unabsorbable osmotic solute (e.g. lactase deficiency) in the gut lumen, creates an osmotic gradient that draws water into the intestinal lumen. 
        
    4. Increase intestinal motility resulting in increase intestinal transit
        
        This underlies the proposed pathogenic mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome and psychogenic diarrhoea (an increase in parasympathetic activity).
        
        Increase in gut motility results in increase intestinal transit, thereby limiting the time available for absorption.
        
- **Complications of diarrhoea**
    
    Diarrhoea results in massive loss of fluid and electrolytes:
    
    - Dehydration, which may result in shock and renal failure
    - Hyponatremia (due to loss of Na+ in stool)
    - Hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl- in stool), which can result in metabolic alkalosis via the action of pendrin
    - Loss of bicarbonate ions, which can result in metabolic acidosis
    
    Diarrhoea results in increased bulk of the stool, which can result in increased peristalsis and increased transit along intestines. This decreases time for absorption, causing *malnutrition*.
    
- **Management of diarrhoea**
    
    The most important treatment in diarrhoea is fluid replacement:
    
    - Oral rehydration solution (ORS) - [[Physiological basis of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy\|Physiological basis of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy]]
    - Intravenous infusion is indicated if ORS cannot be administered (e.g. loss of consciousness or severe vomiting)
    
    Antibiotics is only used when indicated.
    
    Antimotility agents are only used in non-infective causes of diarrhoea, and are generally avoided in invasive infections.
