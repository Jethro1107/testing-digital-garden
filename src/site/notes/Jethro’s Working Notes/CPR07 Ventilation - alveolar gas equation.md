### Alveolar Ventilation

- Define pulmonary ventilation.
    
    Pulmonary ventilation - the minute volume of air that moves into or out of the lungs 
    
    Pulmonary ventilation (V dot) is the product of tidal volume (Vt) and respiratory rate (f)
    
    [[(Pulmonary ventilation equation)\|(Pulmonary ventilation equation)]]
    
- Define anatomical dead space, physiological dead space, and dead space ventilation.
    
    Anatomical dead space:
    
    Refers to the volume of air that remains in the respiratory pathway, which is for conducting air and not for gas exchange
    
    Around 150ml of of tidal volume falls into the anatomical dead space and is not subjected to gas exchange
    
    [[Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Ed. p. 456 - Anatomical dead space\|Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Ed. p. 456 - Anatomical dead space]]
    
    Physiological dead space:
    
    Refers to the sum of anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space (which is space that receives no blood supply and space with excess ventilation)
    
    Around 150ml for a normal subject
    
    Dead space ventilation:
    
    Refers to the minute volume of air that falls into physiological dead space and is thus not subjected to gas exchange
    
    Dead space ventilation (V dot D) is calculated as the product of respiratory rate (f) and volume of air entering physiological dead space (VD)
    
    [[Medical Literature Notes/Dead space ventilation equation\|Dead space ventilation equation]]
    
- Define alveolar ventilation.
    
    Alveolar ventilation - the minute volume of atmospheric air entering functioning alveoli which is subjected to gas exchange
    
    Alveolar ventilation (V dot A) is calculated as the product of Volume of atmospheric air entering functioning alveoli (VA) and the respiratory rate (f)
    
    [[(Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Edition p.456 - alveolar ventilation)\|(Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Edition p.456 - alveolar ventilation)]]
    

### Alveolar Gas Equation

- Using a certain equation, describe the relationship between alveolar ventilation and the alveolar partial pressure of CO2.
    
    Given that the minute volume of CO2 (corresponding to the minute volume of CO2 production by tissues) exhaled is a product of Alveolar ventilation and the fractional concentration of CO2 in alveoli
    
    Note that the minute volume of CO2 exhaled equals the minute volume of CO2 produced at steady state, such that V dot CO2 represents CO2 production
    
    ![[IMG_5041CC407C6F-1.jpeg\|IMG_5041CC407C6F-1.jpeg]]
    
    Alveolar fractional concentration of CO2 equals to the alveolar partial pressure of CO2 divided by total pressure, or alveolar partial pressure of CO2 times a constant of proportionality k1, giving rise to the below equation:
    
    ![[IMG_FDFB44073F7B-1.jpeg\|IMG_FDFB44073F7B-1.jpeg]]
    
    By rearranging equation 1, we derive equation 2:
    
    ![[IMG_A3CCBB795347-1.jpeg\|IMG_A3CCBB795347-1.jpeg]]
    
    Note that V dot CO2 is constant, as it represents the minute volume of CO2 production
    
    As equation 2 implies,
    
    At constant rate of CO2 production (V dot CO2), alveolar partial pressure of CO2 varies inversely with alveolar ventilation
    
    i.e. Increase in alveolar ventilation results in decrease in alveolar partial pressure of CO2
    
    [[Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Ed. p. 459-460 - Qualitative explanation of factors affecting alveolar PCO2\|Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Ed. p. 459-460 - Qualitative explanation of factors affecting alveolar PCO2]]
    
    ![[IMG_14EF32D1FFFA-1.jpeg\|IMG_14EF32D1FFFA-1.jpeg]]
    
    Plotting alveolar PCO2 against alveolar ventilation, the follow observations can be made:
    
    1. Alveolar ventilation is at 4.2L/minute at rest, which causes alveolar PCO2 to be at 40mmHg, represented by the isocapnic line
    2. Hyperventilation, that is excess ventilation with regard to the metabolic activity (V dot CO2) or rightward movement along the curve, causes alveolar PCO2 to decrease
    3. Hypoventilation, that is inadequate ventilation with regard to the metabolic activity (V dot CO2) or leftward movement along the curve, causes alveolar PCO2 to increase
    4. When the metabolic activity increase (V dot CO2), the curve shift to the right
    5. Hypernea, that is increased ventilation to meet increased metabolic activity, will cause alveolar PCO2 to remain at 40mmHg
- Using a certain equation, describe the relationship between alveolar ventilation and the alveolar partial pressure of O2.
    
    Given that the minute volume of O2 uptake is the product of Alveolar ventilation and the fractional concentration of alveolar O2 that is taken up into blood
    
    Fractional concentration of alveolar O2 that is taken up into blood can be modelled by this function:
    
    ![[IMG_BEAD451388F0-1.jpeg\|IMG_BEAD451388F0-1.jpeg]]
    
    As a result, the minute volume of O2 uptake can be modelled by:
    
    ![[IMG_D697057330DF-1.jpeg\|IMG_D697057330DF-1.jpeg]]
    
    By rearranging equation 3, we derive equation 4:
    
    ![[/image.png\|/image.png]]
    
    Note that V dot O2 is is constant, as it represents the minute volume of O2 uptake
    
    [[(Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Ed. p. 459- Factors affecting PAO2)\|(Vander’s Human Physiology 10th Ed. p. 459- Factors affecting PAO2)]]
    
    As equation 4 implies:
    
    Alveolar PO2 varies directly with alveolar ventilation
    
    i.e. When alveolar ventilation increases, alveolar PO2 increases

    Plotting Alveolar PO2 against alveolar ventilation, the following observations can be made:
    
    1. Alveolar ventilation is at 4.2L/minute at rest, which causes alveolar PO2 to be at 100mmHg, represented by the iso-oxic line
    2. Hyperventilation, that is excess ventilation with regards to metabolic activity (V dot O2) causes an increase in alveolar PO2
    3. Hypoventilation, that is inadequate ventilation with regards to metabolic activity (V dot O2), causes a decrease in alveolar PO2
    4. When metabolic activity increases, curve shifts to the right
    5. Hypernea, that is increased alveolar ventilation to meet increased metabolic demand, will cause alveolar PO2 to remain at 100mmHg
- Using the aforementioned equations, come up with the alveolar gas equation. Elaborate on its implications and significance.
    
    By combining equation 1 and equation 3, the alveolar gas equation is derived:
    
    ![[IMG_C194DD79298F-1.jpeg\|IMG_C194DD79298F-1.jpeg]]
    
    [[Medical Literature Notes/Deriving the alveolar gas equation\|Deriving the alveolar gas equation]]
    
    Alveolar gas equation is for calculating the ideal alveolar PO2 of a subject, i.e. the alveolar PO2 that the lung would have if there were no impairment of gas exchange
    
    The ideal alveolar PO2 can then be used to calculate the alveolar-arterial O2 gradient:
    
    ideal alveolar PO2 minus arterial PO2
    
    The alveolar-arterial O2 gradient is the index for gas exchange function:
    
    0 mmHg difference indicates perfect gas exchange
    
    Normal lungs have a difference of less than 10 mmHg
    
    Difference of greater than 10 mmHg indicates impaired gas exchange
    
- How is volume of physiological dead space measured?
    
    Physiological dead space can be measured using Bohr’s method, which makes use of CO2, which is based on the proven fact that all expired CO2 comes from alveolar gas, and none is from dead space. Bohr’s equation for measuring physiological dead space is shown below:

- What is ventilatory capacity?
    
    Ventilatory capacity (V dot C) refers to the maximal minute volume of gas moving in and out the lungs
    
    Note that the symbol for ventilatory capacity is V dot C, not to be confused with VC, which is vital capacity
    
- What are the factors affecting ventilatory capacity?
    1. Size of lungs, which affects maximal stroke
    2. Force available, determined by muscle strength
    3. Airway resistance, which affects instataneous airflow
    4. Respiratory frequency, optimal frequency at 80-90 breaths per minute
    5. Pathological conditions:
        
        Obstructive disease - affects air flow
        
        Restrictive disease, which increases compliance
        
- Describe the regional distribution of ventilation. Account for the physiological causes of such differences in distribution of ventilation.
    
    More ventilation to base, less ventilation to apex
    
    ![[IMG_19560856188C-1.jpeg\|IMG_19560856188C-1.jpeg]]
    
    While we assume that intrapleural pressure (Pip) is the same in all regions at end expiratory position, that is not the case
    
    Due to gravitational effects, the intrapleural pressure at the base (at -2.5 cm H2O) is less subatmospheric than that of the apex (at -10 cm H2O)
    
    Hence, the transpulmonary pressure acting on the base of the lungs (at 2.5 cm H2O) is smaller than that acting on the apex of the lungs (at 10 cm H2O)
    
    As a result, resting volume of the base of the lung is lower than that of the apex of the lung
    
    At resting volume, lung compliance of the base of the lung is greater than that of the apex of the lung, thus allowing greater distribution of ventilation to the base than to the apex

- Account for the pathological factors affecting regional distribution of ventilation.
    
    Filling time of alveolus or time constant is the product of regional lung compliance and airway resistance
    
    Theoretically, altering of the two components would affect the filling time, and affect the regional distribution of ventilation
    
    Increase in time constant indicates long filling time, making it a slow alveolus, and thus less ventilation
    
    Decrease in time constant indicates short filling time, making it a fast alveolus and thus more ventilation
    
    The four pathological changes that cause uneven ventilation are:
    
    1. Regional changes in elasticity:
        
        Regional loss of elasticity increases compliance, and thus increases filling time, resulting in less ventilation
        
    2. Regional obstuction:
        
        Regional obstruction increases airway resistance, and thus increases filling time, resulting in less ventilation
        
    3. Regional check valve
        
        Regional check valve decreases lung elasticity and increases compliance, the loss of elasticity would also result in a decrease in radial traction, causing an increase in airway resistance, and thus increases filling time, resulting in less ventilation
        
    4. Regional disturbance in expansion (edema)
        
        Regional disturbance of edema decreases compliance, shorter filling time but lower smaller change in volume
