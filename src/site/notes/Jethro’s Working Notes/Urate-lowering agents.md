### Urate-lowering agents

Urate-lowering agents are used to lower serum uric acid level, by modulating different parts of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Uric acid metabolism\|Uric acid metabolism]].

There are in general 3 classes of urate-lowering agents: 1) *****************************Xanthine Oxidase inhibitors,***************************** 2) *****************Uricosuric agents*****************, 3) ******************Uricolytic agents.******************

Urate-lowering agents are mainly used for the **************long-term management of gout (Management of chronic tophaceous gout, or intercritical gout)**************, and **************************************never used in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis**************************************, as [[Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares\|Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares]].

### Xanthine oxidase inhibitors

- ****************************Examples of Xanthine oxidase inhibitors****************************
    
    Allopurinol, febuxostat
    
- **************************************************************************************************************************MOA of Xanthine oxidase inhibitors**************************************************************************************************************************
    
    Xanthine oxidase works by decreasing uric acid synthesis.
    
    Allopurinol is activated into alloxanthine by xanthine oxidase.
    
    Alloxanthine in turn non-competitively inhibits xanthine oxidase, thus inhibiting the conversion of Hypoxanthines into xanthines and eventually into uric acids.
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    This results in **decreased uric acid synthesis**, and **increase in serum xanthine levels**, which is more soluble.
    
    Febuxostat directly inhibits xanthine oxidase.
    
- ********************************************************************************************Adverse effects of Xanthine oxidase inhibitors********************************************************************************************
    1. Xanthine stones (Nephrothialisis)
        
        Inhibition of xanthine oxidase results in elevation of serum xanthine levels, and an increase in xanthine concentration in urine, which can cause xanthine stones.
        
        This is avoided by drinking large volumes of water, maintaining a high daily urine output of >2L, resulting in a lower concentration of xanthine in urine.
        
        A high urine pH (> pH 6) by taking sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate can also prevent the formation of xanthine stones.
        
    2. [[Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares\|Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares]].
    
    For Allopurinol (**********************************which is generally well tolerated**********************************):
    
    - Gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, vommiting, diarrhoea)
    - Hypersensitivity reactions (with increased risk of **Steven-Johnson syndrome**)
        
        This normally limited to the first 2 months of therapy.
        
        It is associated with the HLA-B*5801 allele, with high prevalence in Southeast Asian and African American, *HLA screening is indicated before initiating allopurinol therapy.*
        
    - Allopurinol is contraindicated in nursing mothers and children, except those with malignancy or genetic defects of purine metabolism.
    - Dose adjustment is required for those with renal insufficiency (as it is excreted by renal mechanisms.
    
    For Febuxostat:
    
    - Liver function abnormalities
        
        Hence, periodic monitoring of liver functions is required.
        
    - Nausea, joint pain and rash
    - Febuxostat is associated with increased risk of ****************myocardial infarction**************** and *******stroke*******
        
        Hence, periodic monitoring of cardiovascular risk is required.
        

### Uricosuric agents

- **Examples of Uricosuric agents**
    
    Probenecid (most commonly used), Benzbromarone, lesinurad
    
- ************************************MOA of Uricosuric agents************************************
    
    Uricosuric agents work by increasing renal excretion of uric acid.
    
    Uricosuric agents inhibit reabsorption of uric acid via Uric acid transporter 1 (UAT1), a member of the organic anion transporter, at the proximal convoluted tubule.
    
    This results in increased concentration of uric acid in the filtrate, resulting in ******************************************************************************************************increased renal excretion of uric acid******************************************************************************************************.
    
    This results in a decrease in serum uric acid levels.
    
- ****************************************************************Precautions of Uricosuric agents****************************************************************
    
    Uricosuric agents have many drug interactions:
    
    - Uricosuric agents inhibit the ******urate-anion exchanger system******, thus also inhibiting the tubular secretions of organic anionic drugs.
        
        This results in elevation of the plasma drug levels.
        
        e.g [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Penicillin\|Penicillin]], methotrexate, glucuronide metabolites of NSAID.
        
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Salicylate\|Salicylate]] NSAIDS inhibit the action of uricosuric agents. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/EditLater\|EditLater]]
    
    Uricosuric agents are avoided in patients with ***************overproduction*************** of uric acid, as concentration of uric acid in filtrate is already high, and can precipitate urate stones.
    
    Uricosuric agents are also avoided in patients with nephrolithiasis.
    
    Uricosuric agents are avoided in patients with renal insufficiency (except benzbromarone).
    
- ************************************************************************Adverse effects of Uricosuric agents************************************************************************
    1. Urate stones (Nephrothialisis)
        
        Inhibition of uric acid reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules will result in a high concentration of uric acid in urine, which will result in the formation of urate stones.
        
        This is avoided by drinking large amounts of water, maintaining a high daily urine volume (>2L), resulting in a low concentration of uric acid in urine.
        
        A high urine pH can also prevent the formation of urine stones.
        
    2. [[Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares\|Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares]]
    3. Mild GI disturbance
    4. Overdose of probenecid can cause fatal outcomes like *****************************************************CNS stimulation, convulsions and respiratory failure.*****************************************************
        
        As probenecid can cross the blood brain barrier.
        

### Uricolytic agents

- **********************************************************Examples of uricolytic agents**********************************************************
    
    **Rasburicase** - A recombinant mammalian urate oxidase, with a short duration of action.
    
    **Pegloticase** - A recombinant mammalian urate oxidase that is conjugated to methoxypolyethylene glycol to prolong circulating half life (duration of action) and diminish immunogenicity.
    
- ************MOA of uricolytic agents************
    
    Uricolytic agents are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of the poorly soluble uric acid to the more soluble allatoin.
    
    This results in a decrease in serum uric acid levels.
    
- **************************************************************Precaution of uricolytic agents**************************************************************
    
    Uricolytic agents are avoided in G6PD deficiency:
    
    - Uricase activity also results in formation of hydrogen peroxide, which results in hemolytic anemia, and the risk of methemoglobinemia.
- ********************************************************************Adverse effects of uricolytic agents********************************************************************
    - Severe allergic reactions
    - Infusion reactions
- ******************************************************************Clinical use of uricolytic agents******************************************************************
    
    Uricolytic agents tend to have little role in the long-term management of gout:
    
    - Pegloticase is used when the patient is refractory to other urate-lowering agents.
    - Rasburicase is seldom use for management of gout due to its short duration of action.
    
    Rasburicase is used for treating transient hyperuricaemia, after chemotherapy, to avoid tumour lysis syndrome.
