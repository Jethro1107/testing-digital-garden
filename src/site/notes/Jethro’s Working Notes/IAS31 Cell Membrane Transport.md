### Functions and Structure of the Plasma Membrane

- What macromolecule constitute the plasma membrane?
    
    Lipids, proteins and carbohydrates
    
- What is the permeability of the plasma membrane?
    
    Selectively permeable/ Semipermeable - allowing some substances to move freely, while restricting movement of some substances
    
- What are the two types of membrane transports by energy requirement?
    
    Active transport and passive transport
    
- What are the three mechanisms of membrane transport and the nature of such transport in terms of energy requirement?
    
    Diffusion (passive)
    
    Carrier-mediated transport (passive or active)
    
    Vesicular transport (active)
    

### Simple Diffusion and Facilitated Diffusion

- What is diffusion?
    
    Movement of substances down a concentration gradient
    
    Passive process
    
- What are factors influencing diffusion?
    
    Concentration gradient, temperature, distance, size of particle, electrical force
    
    Electrical force - Intracellular compartment of cell membrane is relatively negatively charged, thus increasing the rate of diffusion of positive ions into the cell
    
- What are the two types of diffusion? What are the factors affecting the rate of diffusion?
    
    Simple diffusion - Lipid-soluble compounds and dissolved gases can directly move across the phospholipid bilayer
    
    Concentration gradient, size, electrical charge, lipid solubility, temperature affects rate of simple diffusion
    
    Channel-mediated diffusion - for water-soluble ions, around 1nm diameter, which only allows passage of ions but not organic molecules like glucose
    
    Size, charge, and interactions with the channel are factors affecting rate of channel-mediated diffusion
    
- What is osmosis?
    
    Osmosis is the diffusion of water from region of low osmolarity to region of high osmolarity
    
    The membrane is freely permeable to water
    
    Movement of water due to osmosis results in the increase in volume in the region of high osmolality, and a decrease in volume in the region of low osmolality
    
- What is osmotic pressure? What is hydrostatic pressure?
    
    Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure applied to prevent osmotic flow despite the difference in osmolarity
    
    The pressure to be applied is hydrostatic pressure
    
- What is osmolarity?
    
    Solute concentration of the solution
    
- What is tonicity?
    
    A description of how the solution affects a cell
    
    Isotonic ⇒ No net osmotic flow
    
    Hypertonic ⇒ Water moves out the cell
    
    Hypotonic ⇒ Water moves in the cell
    
- What is channel-mediated diffusion? What are the factors affecting rate of channel-mediated diffusion?
    
    Passive process
    
    Channel proteins transport small inorganic ions
    
    Size, charge, concentration gradient, temperature, nature of channel
    
- What is facilitated diffusion?
    
    Passive process
    
    Carrier proteins transport molecules too large to pass through channel proteins (glucose and amino acids)
    
    Carrier proteins contains receptor sites, in which transport molecule must fit and and to the receptor, which causes change in shape of the protein, releasing the molecule on the other side
    

### Active Transport and Vesicular Transport

- What is primary active transport? What are the two types of pumps involved in primary active transport?
    
    Primary active transport - Transport mechanisms that move substrates against concentration gradient at the expense of ATP, e.g. ion pumps, exchange pumps
    
- What is secondary active transport? Illustrate the idea of secondary active transport with an example.
    
    Secondary active transporter - Transport mechanisms that move substrate against concentration gradients that do not require energy, but the cell uses ATP later to preserve homeostasis. e.g. SLGT
    
- What is vesicular transport? Classify vesicular transport by the direction of transport.
    
    Vesicular transport is the movement of materials in or out of cells in vesicles, requiring ATP
    
    Endocytosis - Movement into the cell:
    
    Receptor-mediated
    
    Pinocytosis
    
    Phagocytosis
    
    Exocytosis - Movement out of the cell
    
- Describe the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis.
    
    Ligands bind to the receptors on the plasma membrane
    
    Membrane area covered with ligands would form a deep pocket
    
    Pocket pinches off to form an endosome
    
    Endosome forms with primary lysosome to form a secondary lysosome
    
    Lysosomal enzymes digest ligand, in which the digested products diffuse into the cytosol
    
    The lysosomal and endosomal membrane separate
    
    Endosomal membrane return to the plasma membrane
    
- What is the vesicle formed from pinocytosis?
    
    Pinosome
    
- What is the vesicle formed from phagocytosis?
    
    Phagosome
    
- Describe the process of phagocytosis in macrophage immune response.
    
    Pathogen binds to receptors on the plasma membrane, triggering the formation of pseudopodia
    
    Pseudopodia fuse to engulf the pathogen, forming a phagosome
    
    Phagosome fuse with lysosome to form a phagolysosome
    
    Lysosomal enzymes digest the pathogen
    
    The digested products are released by exocytosis
