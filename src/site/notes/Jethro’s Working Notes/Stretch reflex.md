### Stretch reflex

Stretch reflex is a somatic reflex in response of a muscle, which results in reflex contraction of the same muscle.

It is a typical reflex that is found in all skeletal muscles, of particular clinical significance, they manifest as:

- Patella reflex (knee jerk reflex)
- Biceps reflex
- Triceps reflex
- Achilles reflex (heel tap reflex)

Assessment of these reflexes would reveal the sensitivity of the reflex arc, which can help distinguish between an upper or lower motor neuron lesion, and the spinal level of the lesion.

### Stretch reflex arc (Neuronal circuitry of the stretch reflex)

Increase in stretch of the muscle (increase in length), results in the stretch of the central portion of the intrafusal muscle fibres (See [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Physiological anatomy of a skeletal muscle\|Physiological anatomy of a skeletal muscle]]), which activates the receptor.

This increase rate of action potential conducted via Ia sensory nerve fibres.

1a sensory nerve fibres enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root, much of it would be passed to the ventral gray horn of the spinal cord.

1a sensory nerve fibres stimulate alpha motor neuron of the same muscle (hence, a *******************monosynaptic reflex*******************), which sends action potential to stimulate contraction of the same muscle.

1a sensory nerve fibres also stimulate inhibitory interneurons, which then inhibit alpha motor neurons of the antagonistic muscle, resulting in relaxation of the antagonistic muscle.

Alpha-gamma co-activation is also required. Ia sensory nerve fibres also activate gamma neurons, which causes the two ends of the intrafusal muscle fibre to contract, thus maintaining the Ia sensory fibre response. This prevents the muscle spindle system from opposing muscle contraction and relaxation.
