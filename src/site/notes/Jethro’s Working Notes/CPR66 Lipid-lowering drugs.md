### 3-Hydroxy-3-Methyglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins)

- **Examples of statins**
    
    Lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin
    
- **MOA of statins**
    
    Reduce levels of LDL by:
    
    Statins inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase, thus decreasing de nevo cholesterol synthesis in the liver
    
    This indirectly cause increased LDL receptors expression of hepatocytes, causing increased clearance of LDL
    
    This causes a mild decrease in TAG, and a modest rise in HDL
    
- **Clinical use of statins**
    
    Prevents atherosclerosis progression in patients with elevated LDL:
    
    By lowering LDL-C
    
- **Contraindications of statins**
    
    Contraindicated in pregnancy (hormone and cell membrane synthesis) and children (cell membrane synthesis for growth)
    
- **Definition of high-, moderate-, low-intensity statin therapy**
    
    High - ≥ 50% decrease in LDL-C
    
    Moderate - 30-49% decrease in LDL-C
    
    Low - <30% decrease in LDL-C
    
    Dose dependent, in general doubling of dose results in 5% increase in reduction of LDL-C
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    - **Genetic defects causing attenuated statin response**
        
        Familial hypercholesteremia - Due to deficient or defect in LDL receptors
        
        Cf: [[Familial hypercholesteremia\|Familial hypercholesteremia]]
        
- **Duration of action of different statins (time taken and rationale)**
    
    Short half life (1-4 hours) - Lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin
    
    Taken before bedtime
    
    Long half life (14-20 hours) - Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin
    
    Taken any time of the day
    
    This is because hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis is maximal between midnight and 2am
    
- **Adverse effects of statins**
    
    Relatively safe - only mild adverse effects of gastrointestinal disturbance
    
    Risk of hepatoxicity (discontinue if persistant elevated alanine aminotransferase ALT)
    
    Risk of myopathy (cause elevated plasmacreatinine kinase CK levels), resulting in muscle soreness and weakness
    
    Risk of rhabdomyolysis, causing renal failure and death
    
- **Metabolism of statins**
    
    All statins except pravastatin are metabolised by cytochrome P450 in the liver
    
- **Factors causing elevated plasma statin levels (exacerbate adverse effects)**
    
    Advanced age (reduced liver and renal functions), causing reduced drug elimination
    
    Hepatic or renal dysfunction
    
    Small body size (smaller blood volume)
    
    Drug interactions:
    
    Reduced hepatic uptake of statins by organic anion transporter (OATP1B1) - gemfibrozil, not fenofibrate
    
    Reduced metabolism of statin by cytochrome P450 and glucuronidase - gemfibrozil (not with fenofibrate), warfarin, erythromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors
    

### Niacin and Fibrates

- Niacin
    - **What is niacin?**
        
        Vitamin B3

        Increasing LPL synthesis, thus increasing VLDL clearance
        
        Increase beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver, causing decreased VLDL secretion
        
        This causes a decrease in triglycerides
        
        Modest increase in levels of HDL by:
        
        Via PPAR-alpha stimulation, resulting in increased synthesis of ApoA
        
    - **Clinical use of fibrates**

        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **MOA of resins**
        
        Reduce levels of LDL by:
        
        Binds to bile acids in the intestines to reduce reabsorption of bile acids in entero-hepatic circulation, promoting increased excretion of bile acids
        
        This indirectly promotes expression of LDL receptors to promote LDL-C uptake
        
        Bile acids resin also indirectly activate HMG-CoA reductase to promote de novo cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes, which partially offset the uptake of LDL
        
    - **Clinical use of resins**
        
        Used in coditions with elevated LDL (hypercholesterolemia), in conjunction with statins
        
        May cause increased hepatic TAG synthesis due to decreased activation of famesoid X receptor (FXR) by bile acids - Contraindicated in hypertriglyceridemia
        
        Used in patients 11-20 years old - due to little systemic toxicity (since not absorbed)
        
        Help to relieve pruritus due to cholestasis and bile acid accumulation
        
        Reduce digoxin toxicity by binding to digoxin
        
    - **Adverse effects of resins**

### Newer lipid lowering drugs

- Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin-Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) Inhibitors
    - **Function of PCSK9**
        
        PCSK9 is a protease produced by the liver that degrades hepatic LDL receptors

        Reduced levels of LDL by:
        
        Binding to PCSK9, thus preventing it to bind to LDL receptors, which inactivates LDL receptor degradation
        
        This increases LDL receptor recycling, and thus increased LDL-C uptake
        
    - **Clinical use of PCSK9 inhibitors**

        For patients refractory to diet modification and maximally tolerated statin therapy
        
        - Can be used for familial hypercholesteremia if the genetic defect is due to a gain-of-function of PCSK9
        - Used in patients with ASCVD needing additional LDL lowering
    - **Adverse effects of PCSK9 inhibitors**
        
        Mild nasopharyngitis and injection site reaction

        - Can be used in patients with familial hypercholesteremia
        - Used in patients with ASCVD needing additional LDL lowering
    - **Adverse effects of ACL inhibitors**
        1. Risk of hyperurecemia (due to inhibition of renal organic anion transporter 1)
        2. Risk of hepatotoxicity (monitor ALT levels)
        3. Risk of tendon rupture (discontinue with signs of joint inflammation)
        4. Risk of myopathy (when used conomitantly with statins)
- Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTP) Inhibitor

        Reduces plasma VLDL, LDL levels by:
        
        Bind to MTP thus inhibiting transfer of TAG to apoB
        
        This decreases the assembly of VLDL and chylomicrons in the liver and intestine, causing decreased secretion of VLDL and chylomicrons
        
        This eventually results in a decrease in LDL levels
        
    - **Clinical use of MTP inhibitor**

        Decrease levels of VLDL and LDL levels by:
        
        Binding to mRNA of ApoB100, resulting in degradation of the mRNA
        
        This results in decreased synthesis of ApoB100 and decreased assembly of VLDL
        
        Reduced VLDL levels result in reduced LDL levels
        
    - **Clinical use of Apolipoprotein B Synthesis inhibitor**

    Statin + Resins
    
    Statin + PCSK9 inhibitor
    
    Ezetimibe + PCSK9 inhibitor
