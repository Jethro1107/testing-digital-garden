### Muscles of the thigh

The muscles of the thigh is separated into the anterior and posterior compartment by the lateral and medial intermuscular septum. The posterior compartment is further separated into a medial compartment and posterior compartment by the posterior intermuscular septum.

- The anterior group are mainly extensors of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Knee joint\|Knee joint]].
- The medial group are adductors of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hip joint\|Hip joint]].
- The posterior group are extensors of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hip joint\|Hip joint]] and flexors of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Knee joint\|Knee joint]].

### Anterior compartment of the thigh

The anterior group of muscles of the thigh are mainly extensors of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Knee joint\|Knee joint]], it includes the 1) ***Sartorius*** and 2) *Quadriceps femoris*.

- ******************Sartorius******************
    
    The sartorius is the longest muscle of the body. It originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts at the medial side of the tibia, just below the medial condyle of the tibia. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Say Grace to Tea denotes the goose feet\|Say Grace to Tea denotes the goose feet]].
    
    The sartorius enables:
    
    - Flexion, lateral rotation and abduction of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hip joint\|Hip joint]]
    - Extension of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Knee joint\|Knee joint]] and medial rotation of the tibia with respect to the fibula.
- ************Quadriceps femoris************
    
    The Quadriceps femoris has 4 heads, each with their own origin.
    
    ******************Rectus femoris -****************** Rectus femoris has 2 heads, the straight head originates from the anterior superior iliac spine, while the reflected head originates from the part of ilium superior to the acetabulum.
    
    *******************Vastus lateralis -******************* Vastus lateralis lies lateral to the rectus femoris. It originates from the lateral surface of the shaft of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femur\|Femur]].
    
    ******************Vastus medialis -****************** Vastus medialis lies medial to the rectus femoris and deep to the Sartorius. It originates from the medial surface of the shaft of the femur and the medial intermuscular septum.
    
    *********************Vastus intermedius -********************* Vastus intermedius lies deep to the rectus femoris. It originates from the anterior surface of the femur.
    
    The 4 heads fuse to form a quadriceps tendon, which attaches to the patella. The patella consists of the **********ligamentum patellae**********, enabling the quadriceps femoris muscle to ****************************************************************************insert at the tibial tuberosity of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tibia\|Tibia]].**
    
    All 4 heads of the quadriceps femoris enable **extension of the knee joint**. As the rectus femoris crosses the Hip joint, it also enables **flexion of the hip joint.**

### Medial compartment of the thigh

The medial group of muscles of the thigh are ****************adductors**************** of the thigh, There are 6 muscles, from superolateral to inferomedial: 1) ***********Pectineus,*********** 2) *****************Adductor longus,***************** 3) **************Adductor brevis,************** 4) **************Adductor magnus (Adductor portion)************** and 5) **********Gracilis.********** The obturator externus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Muscles of the gluteal region\|Muscles of the gluteal region]]) is also considered as an adductor of the thigh.

- ****************Pectineus****************
    
    The pectineus originates from the superior ramus of the pubis (pectineal line) and inserts on the upper end of the linea aspera.
    
- ******************************Adductor longus******************************
    
    The adductor longus originates from the body of the pubis, and inserts at the middle 1/3 of the linea aspera.
    
- ********************Adductor brevis********************
    
    The adductor brevis is deep and slightly lateral to the adductor longus. It originates from the body of the pubis and the inferior ramus of the pubis, and inserts at the upper 1/3 of the linea aspera.
    
- ********************************************************************Adductor magnus (adductor portion)********************************************************************
    
    The adductor magus is deep to the pectineus, adductor longus and adductor brevis.
    
    The adductor portion of the adductor magus originates from the ischiopubic ramus and inserts at the linea aspera (The hamstring portion, part of the posterior compartment of the thigh originates from the ischial tuberosity and inserts at the adductor tubercle near the medial epicondylar ridge of the femur).
    
- ****Gracilis****
    
    The gracilis originates from the body and inferior ramus of the pubis and inserts at the medial side of the tibia, just below the medial condyle ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Say Grace to Tea denotes the goose feet\|Say Grace to Tea denotes the goose feet]]).

### Posterior compartment of the thigh

The posterior compartment of the thigh, collectively called “hamstrings” are flexors of the knee joint. There are 4 muscles: 1) *************Semitendinosus************* 2) *******************Biceps femoris,******************* 3) ***************Semimembranosus,*************** 4) Hamstring portion of adductor magnus.

- ************************Semitendinosus************************
    
    The semitendinosus is medial to the biceps femoris, and originates from the ischial tuberosity, and inserts at the medial side of the tibia, just below the medial condyle of the tibia. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Say Grace to Tea denotes the goose feet\|Say Grace to Tea denotes the goose feet]].
    
- ********Biceps femoris********
    
    Biceps femoris lies lateral to the semitendinosus, and has 2 heads:
    
    - The long head originates from the ischial tuberosity
    - The short head lies deep to the long head and originates from the linea aspera
    
    The two heads fuse to form a single muscle belly and insert at the head of the fibula.
    
- **************************Semimembranosus**************************
    
    The semimembranosus muscle lies deep to the semitendinosus. It originates from the ischial tuberosity and inserts at the medial tibial condyle (a bit higher than the insertion of the subtendinosus).
    
- **************************Adductor magnus (Hamstring portion)**************************
    
    The hamstring portion of the adductor magnus originates from the ischial tuberosity and inserts at the adductor tubercle, above the medial epicondyle of the femur.
