### Acetominophen-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity

In the liver, [[Paracetamol [[(Acetaminophen)\|Paracetamol [[(Acetaminophen)]]]]  is metabolised by a variety of Phase 1 and Phase 2 enzymes before it is excreted in the kidneys.

Particularly, acetominophen is metabolised by Cytochrome P450 enzymes into NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine), a toxic metabolite. Normally, it would be conjugated with glutathione, and eventually excreted in the kidneys safely (i.e. Glutathione/ GSH scavenges NAPBI to protect the liver and kidneys).

Overdose of acetominophen, in excess of the scavenging capacity of glutathione will result in accumulation of NAPBI, which binds to cellular proteins, resulting in hepatotoxicity ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Drug-induced hepatitis\|Drug-induced hepatitis]]) and nephrotoxicity.
