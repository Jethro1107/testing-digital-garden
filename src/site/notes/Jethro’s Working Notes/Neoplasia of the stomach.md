### Benign neoplasms of the stomach

- Adenoma
- Leiomyoma

### Gastric carcinoma

95% of gastric carcinomas are adenocarcinoma, usually found in the prepyloric region.

- **Etiology of gastric carcinoma**
    
    [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Helicobacter pylori\|Helicobacter pylori]] is classified as a class 1 carcinogen by the WHO.
    
    - Tobaco smoking
    - Diet - Pickled vegetables, nitrosamines (e.g. smoked and salted fish)
    - Premalignant conditions - Gastric adenomas, autoimmune [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastritis\|Gastritis]], dysplastic changes of gastric epithelium
- **Gross pathology of gastric adenocarcinoma**
    - They may appear as polypoidal or fungating tumours.
    - They may appear as ulcerative tumours with everted edges.
    - There may be diffuse involvement of the entire stomach mucosa.
- **Histopathology of gastric adenocarcinoma**
    
    There is abnormal glandular formations with cells showing dysplastic changes.

    In diffuse gastric carcinoma, there are singlet ring cell formations (displaced nucleus with cytoplasm filled with mucin) with minimal glandular formations.

- **Classification of gastric adenocarcinoma**
    
    Classification of gastric adenocarcinoma makes use of Lauren’s classification of gastric adenocarcinoma, into **intestinal types** and **diffuse types**. This classification is *based on location in the stomach, gross pathology and histopathology of the adenocarcinoma*.
    
    |  | Intestinal type | Diffuse type |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Gross pathology | Fungating tumour or ulcerative tumour | Diffuse involvement of the stomach.
    Rugal flattening and rigid, thickened wall imparts a leather-bottle appearance termed linitis plastica. |
    | Histopathology | Irregular glandular formations  | Diffuse sheets of cells with minimal glandular formations.
    There is singlet cell formations, with a displaced, cresentic nucleus and cytoplasm filled with mucin. |

### Early gastric cancer

- **What is early gastric cancer?**
    
    Early gastric cancer refers to tumours limited to the mucosa and submucosa, regardless of the presence of lymph node metastasis.
    
    It is associated with excellent prognosis - a 95% 5 year survival rates after surgical resection.
