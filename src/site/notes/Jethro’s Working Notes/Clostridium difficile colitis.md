### Clostridium -difficile colitis

- **Bacteriology of Clostridium difficile**
    
    Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, anaerobic gram positive bacilli.
    
- **What is clostridium difficile colitis?**
    
    Clostridium difficile colitis is one of the commonest causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use of antibiotics results in loss of gut microbiota, which causes a decrease in colonization resistance. There is less competition for C. difficile, enabling its overgrowth and production of cytotoxins.
    
- **Pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile colitis**
    
    It is mediated by toxin A and toxin B, both of which are cytotoxins.
    
- **Gross pathology of clostridium difficile colitis**
    
    On sigmoidoscopy, there is presence of inflammation of the colonic mucosa, with or without pseudomembrane formation (in C. difficile pseudomembranous colitis).

- **Diagnosis of C. difficile colitis**
    
    Diagnosis of C. difficile colitis requires:
    
    - Sigmoidoscopy to demonstrate inflammation of the colon
    - Stool culture for C. difficile
    - Antigen detection
    - Nucleic acid amplification
- **Treatment of C. difficile**
    
    *Antibiotic therapy.* Oral [[Vancomycin [[(Glycopeptide)\|Vancomycin [[(Glycopeptide)]]]] and [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Fidaxomicin\|Fidaxomicin]] is commonly used. Metronidazole used to be first-line treatment, but is rarely used due to its inferior efficacy.
