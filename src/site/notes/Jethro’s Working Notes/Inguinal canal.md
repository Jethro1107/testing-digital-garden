### Inguinal canal

The inguinal canal is a canal that is continuous from the superficial inguinal ring, the free borders of the internal obliques and transversus abdominis, and the deep inguinal ring.

The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Inguinal ligament\|Inguinal ligament]] forms the floor of the inguinal canal.

It enables the passage of the spermatic cord (in males) and the round ligament (in females).

- **The superficial inguinal ring**
    
    The superficial ring is an opening in the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It is made of the inferior crus, which is at the level of the pubic tubercle, and superior crus, which is at the level of the pubic crest.
