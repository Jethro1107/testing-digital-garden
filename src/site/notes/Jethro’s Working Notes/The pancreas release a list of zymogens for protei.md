### The pancreas release a list of zymogens for protein digestion

The pancreas ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Histology of the pancreas\|Histology of the pancreas]]) release a list of zymogens for protein digestion: Trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen proelastase, procarboxylase A and procarboxylase B.

- **The list of zymogens are activated into their proteolytic counterparts via the following mechanisms:**
    
    Trypsinogen is cleaved by enterokinase on jejunal brush border to release active trypsin.
    
    Trypsin cleaves the remaining zyomogens to their active couterparts (chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxylase A, procarboxylase B into chymotrypsin, elastase, carboxylase A and carboxylase B respectively).

- **Action of pancreatic protease**
    
    Trypsin serves as an endopeptidase that cleaves basic amino acids at their C-terminal.
    
    Chymotrypsin serves as an endopeptidase that cleaves neutral amino acids at their C-terminal.
    
    Elastase serves as an endopeptidase that cleaves neutral amino acids.
    
    Carboxypeptidase A serves as an exopeptidase that cleaves terminal neutral amino acids.
    
    Carboxypeptidase B serves as an exopeptidase that cleaves terminal basic amino acids.
    
    Pancreatic protease converts 70% of luminal peptides into oligopeptides (with acidic amino acid at C terminal as they are resistant to cleavage by carboxypeptidase) and 30% of luminal peptides into amino acids.
