    Distinguish several physiologically important lipids
    
- Classes of Lipids
    
    Acronym: BESTPVC
    
    **B**ile salt - involved in intestinal lipid digestion and absorption
    
    **E**icosanoids - Derived from arichidonic acids, four classes: prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, lipoxins
    
    **S**teroid Hormones - Regulate wide range of physiological functions
    
    **T**riacylglycerol - Found in adipocytes as energy storage, act as padding and insulation for organs
    
    **P**hospholipid / Sphingolipids - Perform different structural roles

- **Steps of Digestion and Transport of dietary lipids**
    - **Hydrolysis**
        
        Lingual (tongue) and gastric (stomach) lipase preferentially cleave TAGs with short FA chains, where short FA chains directly enter blood circulation
        
        Hormone Cholecystokinin is released by intestine when partially digested food enters the duodenum, stimulating the release of bile acids by the contraction of gall bladder and pancreatic enzymes by pancreas
        
        Hormone secretin is released by intestine when acidic material enter the duodenum, stimulating release of bicarbonate by liver, intestinal cells and pancreas to raise pH to 6
        
        Pancreatic lipase breaks down TAG into 2 FFA and 2-monoacylglycerol
        
    - **Micelle Formation and uptake of lipids**
        
        Micelle forms, facilitating lipids to travel across water lining near enterocytes
        
        Micelle interacts with enterocytes, facilitating the diffusion of  lipids into enterocytes
        
        Bile acids do not enter, but travel downstream and is eventually reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation for reusing of bile acids
        
    - **Chylomicron Formation in enterocytes**
        
        In enterocytes, FFA and 2-monoacylglycerol is reincorporated into TAGs, which is packaged into chylomicrons
        
    - **Exocytosis of Chylomicrons**
        
        Enterocytes release chylomicrons into the lymphatic system by exocytosis
        

# Lipids as fuel molecules

- Learning Outcomes
    
    Learn the sites of triacylglycerol storage
    
    Understand the mobilization of triacylglycerol and fatty acids
    
    Understand De novo fatty acid synthesis
    
- **Site of accumulation of triacylglycerol**
    - **Adipose cells (minor)**
        
        White adipose tissue - involved in storing TAG, and mobilization of TAG-derived FA into bloodstream
        
        Brown adipose tissue -involved in dissipating energy into heat
        
    - Liver and Skeletal Muscles (minor)
    - **Process of Triacylglycerol accumulation**
        
        High insulin : glucagon ratio stimulate transportation of GLUT4 to surface of adipocytes to promote uptake of glucose
        
        Glucose is converted to Glycerol-3-P via the glycolytic pathway
        
        High insulin : glucagon ratio promotes synthesis and secretion of LPL, which is activated by C-II apolipoprotein
        
        LPL breaks down TAG in VLDL and chylomicrons to give FA and glycerol
        
        FA enters adipocytes and activated, forming fattyacyl-CoA (FA-CoA)
        
        Glycerol-3-P + FA-CoA â†’ TAG
        
        Glycerol formed from hydrolysis of TAG by LPL not used by adipocytes as adipocytes lack glycerol kinase to phosphorylate glycerol into Glycerol-3-P
        
        Hence, Glycerol formed travels to liver for synthesis of TAG there

- Mobilization of fatty acids
    - **Mobilization in a fasted state**
        
        In fasted state, low insulin:glucagon ratio results in intracellular cyclic adenosine  monophosphate (cAMP) level increase, activating protein kinase A
        
        Protein Kinase A phosphorylate Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), changing it to the active state
        
        HSL cleave FA from adipose TAG, other lipase complete lipolysis
        
        Glycerol and FA formed
        
        Glycerol travel to liver, FA complex with albumin and is transported to liver and skeletal muscles
        
        ![[/Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 5.24.25 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 5.24.25 PM.png]]
        
    - **Beta-Oxidation**
        
        Very high yield
        
        Beta-oxidation cycle - Continuously cleave 2-C unit from fatty acids for formation of Acetyl-CoA, which is fed into TCA cycle, or converted to ketone bodies in the liver
        
    - **Ketone bodies as alternative fuels or peripheral cells**
        
        FA undergoes beta-oxidation to acetyl-CoA, which is converted to ketone bodies in liver
        
        Production elevated during fasting, as ketone bodies are used to produce energy by peripheral cells
        
        Ketone can only be used by extrahepatic cells with mitochondria (RBC cannot):
        
        3-hydroxyl-butyrate oxidized to give acetoacetate
        
        Acetoacetate combines with CoA from TCA cycle to give Acetoacetyl-CoA under action of thiophorase
        
        Acetoacetyl-CoA and a new CoA molecule converted to 2 Acetyl-CoA which is fed into TCA
        
        Liver cells lack enzyme thiophorase to convert acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA
        
- **De nevo fatty acids synthesis**
    
    Occurs during caloric surplus, from excess carbohydrates or proteins
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-09-19 at 10.41.22 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-09-19 at 10.41.22 PM.png]]
    
    Excess glucose undergoes glycoysis to give puruvate, which enters TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA
    
    Excess amino acid enters the TCA cycle as oxoacetate (OAA)
    
    OAA and acetyl-CoA combines to give citrate, which leaves the mitochondria into the cytosol
    
    OAA is released from citrate to regenerate acetyl-CoA
    
    Acetyl-CoA is converted to Malonyl-CoA and enters the fatty acid synthesis complex, 2C is added to the growing fatty acid chain, until Palmitate (16C) is produced, and is converted to FA-CoA for TAG synthesis
    

# Clinical Connections

- Learning Outcomes
    
    Illustrate clinical connections with Lipid Metabolism
    
- MCAD deficiency
    
    Dificiency of medium-chain fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase
    
    Prevents beta-oxidation of medium chain fattyacyl CoA to produce acetyl-CoA
    
    Production of ketone bodies by the liver and gluconeogenesis is inhibited due to lack of acetyl-CoA
    
    Hyperglycemic at fasting
    
- Alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis
    
    Ethanol induce pancreatic necrosis, reducing secretion of pancreatic lipase into the small intestine
    
    This affects the rate of triacylglycerol hydrolysis, thus affecting lipid absorption
    
    Steatorrhea (fat-rich stools) induced
    
- Overweight/Diabetes
    
    Can low fat diet be effective to reduce body fat?
    
    Where do we get triacylglycerol in adipocytes?
    
    Our fat storage is not entirely from dietary intake of fats
    
    Triacylglycerol can be synthesized from excess carbohydrates and proteins by de nevo lipogenesis
