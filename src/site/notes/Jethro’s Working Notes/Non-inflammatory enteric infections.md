### Non-inflammatory enteric infections

- **Clinical presentation of non-inflammatory enteric infections**
    
    Non-inflammatory enteric infections usually present as:
    
    - Nausea and vomiting (usually with a short incubation period), and/or,
    - Watery diarrhea
    
    On investigation, leukocyte is absent in stool examination.
    
- **Pathogenesis of non-inflammatory enteric infections**
    
    Non-inflammatory enteric infections is usually enterotoxin- (secretory toxins) mediated, resulting in increased fluid secretion by the intestines ([[Fluid secretion by crypt cells is mediated by a Cl- dependent mechanism\|Fluid secretion by crypt cells is mediated by a Cl- dependent mechanism]]).
    
- **Location of non-inflammatory enteric infections**
    
    The proximal small bowel is usually involved.
    
- **Etiological agents in non-inflammatory enteric infections**
    
    Depending on symptomatology, non-inflammatory enteric infections are usually caused by:
    
    - Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens - These usually cause watery diarrhea.
    - Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus - These usually cause vomiting.

### Non-inflammatory enteric infections mediated by Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus usually present with vomiting

- **Common etiological agents**
    
    Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus
    
- **Incubation period**
    
    The incubation period of staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus enteric infections is short (1-6 hours).
    
- **Pathogenesis of vomiting in enteric infections**
    
    For staphylococcus aureus GI infections, it is usually caused by ingestion of pre-formed toxins in food, due to contamination of food with Staphylococcus aureus by food handler.
    
    For Bacillus cereus GI infections, it is usually caused by germination of spores in food, due to inappropriate storage temperature.
