### **Arterial Supply of the anterolateral abdominal wall**

- **Superficial parts:**
    - Superior part is supplied by the musculophrenic artery, a branch of the internal thoracic artery
    - Inferior part is supplied by the superficial circumflex iliac artery and the superficial epigastric artery, both branches of the femoral artery
- **At a deeper level:**
    - Superior art is supplied by the superior epigastric artery, a branch of the internal thoracic artery
    - Inferior part is supplied by the inferior epigastric artery and the deep circumflex iliac artery, both branches of the external iliac artery
    - Lateral part is supplied by the 10th and 11th posterior intercostal arteries, as well as the subcostal arteries
    
    The superior and inferior epigastric arteries enter the rectus sheath, and is positioned posterior of the rectus abdominis along its course, and they anastamose with one another.
