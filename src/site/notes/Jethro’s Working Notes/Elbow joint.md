### Elbow joint

The elbow joint is a joint between the bones of the arm ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Humerus\|Humerus]]) and the bones of the forearm ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Radius\|Radius]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ulna\|Ulna]]), that includes 3 articulations, enclosed within a single joint capsule and synovial cavity. It includes:

- The *humeroradial joint*, which joins the capitulum of the humerus to the head of the radius,
- he *humeroulnar joint*, which joins the trochlea of the humerus to the trochlea notch of the ulna, and ,
- The *proximal radioulnar joint.*

- **Classification of the elbow joint**
    
    The elbow joint is a typical hinge joint, which only supports flexion and extension of the elbow.

- **Joint capsule of the elbow joint**
    
    The joint capsule of the elbow joint consist of a lax articular ligament both anteriorly and posteriorly.
    
    The fibrous membrane of the joint capsule is thickened laterally and medially:
    
    - Laterally, the joint capsule is thickened to give the radial collateral ligament. Its proximal attachment is at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, and its distal attachment is at the annular ligament of the radius.
    - Medially, the joint capsule is thickened to give to give the ulnar collateral ligament, which consists of 3 bands:
        
        The anterior band connects the medial epicondyle to the coronoid process, the posterior band connects the medial epicondyle to the olecranon, the transverse band connects between the anterior and posterior bands.
        
    
    Distally, the joint capsule of the elbow joint is reinforced by the annular ligament of the radius, which cuffs the head of the radius.
    
    Note that the radial collateral ligament attaches distally to the annular ligament of the radius, rather than the radius. This enables pronation and supination of the radius within the annular ligament.

- **Movement of the elbow joint**
    
    The elbow joint enables:
    
    - Flexion and extension
