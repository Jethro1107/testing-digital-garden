### Features of Cervical Vertebrae

There are 7 cervical vertebrae (C1-C7).

- ****************************Vertebral body****************************
    
    Cervical vertebrae consist of relatively rectangular vertebrae bodies with a concave superior surface and a convex inferior surface.
    
    The superolateral region of the vertebral body is elevated, termed the uncinated process, or uncus of the body.
    
    The vertebral bodies of cervical vertebrae are much smaller than that of other regional vertebrae as they bear less weight.
    
- ************************************Transverse process************************************
    
    A distinct feature of cervical vertebrae is the presence of transverse foramen within the transverse process.
    
    Vertebral arteries ascending through the transverse foramen of C6 to C1 and enters the skull. As the vertebral arteries do not course through the transverse process of C7, transverse foramen may or may not be present.
    
    The transverse process also terminate laterally as two bony projections, the anterior and posterior tubercle, which provide surfaces for attachment of cervical muscles, such as the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Levator scapulae\|Levator scapulae]], and the scalene muscles.
    
- ******************************Spinous process******************************
    
    Spinous process of C2-C6 (C1 does not consist of a spinous process) is bifid.
    
    C7 has the longest spinous process, which forms the palpable *******************vertebra prominens******************* at the back of the neck.
    
- ******************************Articular facet******************************
    
    The articular facets of the superior and inferior articular processes project superiorly and inferiorly respectively: ******The articular facets are horizontal/ transversely oriented.******
    
    Hence, the cervical vertebrae enables the greatest range of motion:
    
    - Flexion and extension
    - Lateral flexion

- ********************************C1 and C2 are atypical cervical vertebrae********************************
    
    C1, also known as the atlas, is a ring-shaped vertebrae *************************************************that lacks the vertebral body and spinous process*************************************************.
    
    - 2 lateral masses replace the vertebral body, that connect anteriorly by the anterior arch, and posteriorly by the posterior arch (the posterior arch resembles the laminae of typical vertebrae, see [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Structure of a typical vertebrae\|Structure of a typical vertebrae]]), to complete the ring shape.
    - The anterior arch and posterior arch is marked with the anterior and posterior tubercle centrally.
    - The 2 lateral masses consist of a superior articular surface that articulates with the occipital condyle of the skull at the atlantoccipital joint.
    - Transverse process arise from the lateral masses, with a transverse foramen. Vertebral arteries ascend through the transverse foramen of the atlas, the course posterior to the lateral mass through ***********************************the groove for the vertebral artery*********************************** on the posterior arch.
    - The *transverse ligament of the atlas* extends between the two lateral mass in the vertebral foramen, separating the *dens of the axis* from the spinal cord.

    C2, also known as the axis, ressembles a typical vertebrae, but consist of the dens/odontoid process that projects superiorly.
    
    - The *****************dens of the axis,***************** projects superiorly into the socket formed by the ************transverse ligament of the atlas************ and the anterior arch of the atlas.
    - It serves as the axis of lateral rotation.

    C1 and C2 at the 2 lateral atlantoaxial joint and 1 medial atlantoaxial joint.
    
    - The 2 lateral atlantoaxial joints serve as synovial plane joint, enabling flexion, extension and lateral flexion.
    - The medial atlantoaxial joint serves as a pivot joint, enabling lateral rotation, or the ‘no’ movement.
