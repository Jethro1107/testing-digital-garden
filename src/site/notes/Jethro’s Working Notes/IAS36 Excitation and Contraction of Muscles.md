### Basic Organization of the Contractile Machinery

- What are the three types of Muscles and how do they differ?
    
    Skeletal Muscles:
    
    Organised myofibrils, which form striations
    
    Muscle fibres have long cylindrical shape
    
    Muscle fibres are multi-nucleated
    
    T-tubules are long
    
    Cardiac muscles:
    
    Organised myofibrils, which form striations
    
    Muscle fibres are short and branched
    
    Muscle fibres have single centrally-located nucleus
    
    T-tubules are short
    
    Smooth muscles:
    
    No myofibrils due to lack of sarcomeres, thus no striations
    
    Muscle fibres have spindle shape
    
    Muscle fibres have single centrally-located nucleus
    
    No T-tubules are present
    
- How are skeletal muscle fibres formed?
    
    Formed from fusing myoblasts
    
    Myosatellite cells (Muscle stem cells) are found attached to adult muscle fibres, and have not fused with myoblasts
    
    During injury, they divide and fuse with the muscle fibre to repair the damaged muscle tissue
    
- What are the structures present in a skeletal muscle fibre?
    
    Myofibrils - consist of thick and thin filaments
    
    Mitochondria
    
    Sarcolemma - Plasma membrane of muscle fibre
    
    Sarcoplasmic reticulum - involved in the storage and release of Ca2+ ions
    
    Transverse (T) tubules - invagination of sarcolemma, continuous with sarcolemma and extends deep into sarcoplasm, involved in conducting action potential into the muscle fibre
    
- What are the names of the striations?
    
    Light bands are I bands
    
    Dark bands are A bands
    
- What is the basic unit of a myofibril? What is present in it?
    
    Sarcomere is the basic unit of a myofibril, its boundary defined by the 2 Z line
    
    M line is the middle line of the sarcomere
    
    It consists of thin filament and thick filament
    
- What is the structure of a thin filament?
    
    4 structures present: F-actin, nebulin, tropomyosin, tropomin
    
    F-actin - consists of 2 intertwining strands of actin. Actin molecules consists of active sites for binding with myosin heads
    
    Nebulin - located between the F-actin strands to hold the strands together
    
    Tropomyosin-tropomin complex - Tropomyosin covers the active site on actin in rest state, while tropomin consists of a binding receptor for Ca2+
    
- What is the structure of a thick filament?
    
    A thick filament consists of around 300 myosin molecules, each myosin molecules made of 2 intertwining myosin subunits
    
    Myosin heads consist of 2 globular subunits pointing towards the thin filaments
    
    Myosin heads bind to myosin tail by hinge, which allows the myosin heads to pivot/change orientation
    
- Explain the sliding filament theory.

### Excitation-Contraction Coupling

- What is the specialised intercellular connection between the motor neuron and the skeletal muscle fibre called?
    
    Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)
    
- What type of synapse is the NMJ? Explain. What is present in the presynaptic and post synaptic cell that makes the NMJ functional?
    
    Peripheral chemical synapse - the synapse is found in the peripheral nervous system. The motor neuron and the muscle fibre interact by means of a chemical - acetylcholine
    
    The presynaptic cell consist of synaptic vesicles carrying acetylcholine at the active zone, while the post synaptic cell consists of acetylcholine receptors
    
- How does acetylcholine receptor trigger muscle contraction?
    
    Acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated cation channels (Na+, K+)
    
    It is a pentameric channel, with 2 alpha subunits, a beta subunit, a gamma subunit and a delta subunit
    
    The binding site for acetylcholine is found on the two alpha subunits
    
    When ACh binds to AChR, it results in a conformational change, resulting in the opening of the cation channel
    
    This results in an influx of Na+ and an efflux of K+
    
    Depolarization of the membrane is induced, thus triggering muscle contraction
    
- Draw a diagram illustrating the cycle of acetylcholine synthesis and degradation.
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    When an action potential depolarises the synaptic terminal, it opens a voltage gated Ca2+ channel, causing an influx Ca2+
    
    This stimulates the release of ACh by exocytosis of synaptic vesicles
    
    ACh dffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to AChR on the membrane of muscle fibre, producing a graded depolarization
    
    Depolarization ends when ACh is broken down into acetate and choline by Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
    
    Choline is returned to the presynaptic cell and reused for synthesis of ACh
    
- Describe the steps to contraction cycle.
    
    Contraction cycle begins - Contraction cycle begins with arrival of Ca2+ at the zone of overlap
    
    Active-site exposure - Ca2+ binds with troponin, which changes its position, rolling the tropomyosin molecule away from the active site on actin
    
    Cross-bridge formation - Myosin head binds to the active site on actin to form a cross-bridge, phosphate group is lost to strengthen the interaction between myosin head and actin (strengthen the cross-bridge)
    
    Myosin head pivot (Power stroke) - The energy stored in the energised myosin head is released as the myosin head pivots towards the M line, pulling actin towards the M line, ADP is removed as a process
    
    Cross-bridge detachment - Another ATP molecule binds to the myosin head to detach myosin head from the active site of actin
    
    Myosin Activation - Myosin head activates by hydrolyzing ATP. Energy released recocks myosin head
    

### Calcium Ions and ATP in Muscle Contraction

- What is the Transverse (T) tubule? How is it involved in muscle contraction?
    
    T-tubule - Invagination of sarcolemma and extends deep into the muscle fiber
    
    It is involved in rapid transmission of active potential from cell surface to the interior of the muscle fiber
    
- What is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)? How is it involved in muscle contraction?
    
    Sarcoplasmic reticulum - Internal tubular structure involved in the storage and release of Ca2+
    
- What is a triad?
    
    2 terminal cisternae and 1 T-tubule forms a triad
    
- How is Calcium release from SR regulated?
    
    ACh binds to AChR, resulting in the depolarization of the sarcolemma
    
    This opens DHP (dihydropyridine) receptor, a voltage-gated calcium channel, results in a small influx of Ca2+
    
    Ryanodine receptor also opens, resulting in a large release of Ca2+
    
- How does the calcium release initiate muscle contraction?
    
    Ca2+ can bind to troponin to trigger the contraction cycle
    
- How is ATP synthesised and used in a resting muscle?
    
    ATP is synthesized from the aerobic metabolism of fatty acids (beta-oxidation) in the mitochondria
    
    ATP produced is used to build energy reserves such as glycogen and creatine phosphate
    
- How is ATP synthesised and used in moderate muscular activity?
    
    Glucose and fatty acids are aerobically catabolised to release ATP
    
    ATP produced is used to power contractions
    
- How is ATP synthesised during peak muscular activity?
    
    Most of the ATP synthesised is from glycolysis, as oxygen fails to diffuse into muscle fibers fast enought for aerobic metabolism
    
    Some ATP is synthesized from converting creatine phosphate to creatine
    
- How is ATP involved in the contraction cycle?
    
    ATP binds to myosin head at the end of a contraction cycle to detach the cross-bridge
    
    ATP hydrolyzed by the free myosin head to reactivate/recock the myosin head
