### Thermal Balance

- Why are humans described as homeothermic?
    
    Because the core body temperature is maintained within a narrow range by thermoregulatory mechanisms, and displays a diurnal rhythm
    
    The surface temperature fluctuates more than the core body temperature as it also depends on environmental temperature
    
- How is thermal balance maintained?
    
    By balancing heat gain and heat loss
    
    When heat gain = heat loss, thermal balance is achieved
    
- What contributes to heat gain?
    
    Heat production + heat transferred from environment
    
    Heat production is a byproduct of metabolism, including the basal metabolic rate, muscle activity, additional metabolism under the effect of thyroxine, epinephrine, norepinephrine and sympathetic stimulations on cells, and additional metabolism due to increased body temperature
    
- What contributes to heat loss?
    
    Heat transfer to the surrounding environment
    
- How is heat transferred from skin to surrounding environments?
    
    Radiation - heat transfer by electromagnetic heat waves
    
    Conduction - direct transfer of heat from one object to another in contact
    
    Convection - dissipation of heat by air currents
    
    Evaporation - dissipation of heat from body in forms of insensible water loss and sweating (regulatable)
    
- Why is thermal balance important?
    
    Most metabolic reactions are driven by enzymes, which only function optimally in a narrow range of temeperature
    
    Hence, thermal balance is important to keep our core body temperature stable to support metabolic and physiological functions of our body
    

### Homeostatic Regulation of Core Body Temperature

- Briefly describe how thermoregulation is achieved by a negative feedback mechanism.
    
    Thermoreceptors detects the skin temperature and core temperature and sends signals to the hypothalamic thermoregulatory centre
    
    Thermoregulatory centre determines the set point for temperature control
    
    If body temperature deviates from set point, the thermoregulatory centre sends signals to effectors to carry out compensatory responses to correct the core body temperature back to set point
    
- What kinds of thermoreceptors are present to detect skin temperature and core temperature?
    
    Skin temperature:
    
    Cold receptors (predominant): Increases firing when temperature decreases
    
    Warmth receptors: Increases firing when temperature increases
    
    Core temperature:
    
    Anterior hypothalamus:
    
    Cold-sensitive neurons: Increases firing when temperature decreases
    
    Heat-sensitive neurons (predominant): Increases firing when temperature increases
    
    Deep tissues:
    
    Cold receptors: Increases firing when temperature decreases
    
    - Draw a diagram that shows the neural feedback in termoregulation.

- What factors do rate of heat loss depend on?
    1. How rapidly heat is conducted from the core to skin by blood vessels
    2. How rapidly heat can be transferred from surface of skin to surroundings
    - What controls blood flow to skin?
        
        Vasoconstrictor sympathetic nervous system
        
        Cold ⇒ Sympathetic activity increases ⇒ Blood flow to skin decreases
        
        Hot ⇒ Sympathetic activity decreases ⇒ Blood flow to skin increases
        
- What are the physiological responses to heat?
    
    Increase Heat loss:
    
    Vasodilation of the cutaneous arterioles (decreased sympathetic activities) ⇒ Increased blood flow to skin ⇒ Increased heat loss by conduction, convection, radiation
    
    Increased sweating to increase evaporative heat loss
    
    Decrease heat production
    
- What are the behavioural responses to heat?
    
    Change of clothing, change of environment to a cooler environment, decreased voluntary activity
    
- What are the physiological responses to cold?
    
    Decrease heat loss:
    
    Vasoconstriction of cutaneous arterioles (decreased sympathetic activities) ⇒ decrease blood flow to skin ⇒ Decreased heat loss by conduction, convection and radiation
    
    Piloerection by contraction of arrector pilli muscles ⇒ trap still air near skin surface ⇒ improves insulation
    
    Increase heat production (thermogenesis):
    
    Shivering thermogenesis
    
    Chemical thermogenesis by action of thyroxine, epinephrine, norepinephrine
    
- What are the behavioural responses to cold?
    
    Change of clothing, change of environment to a warmer environment, increased voluntary activity
    

### Pyrexia and Hyperthermia

- What is the difference between pyrexia and hyperthermia?
    
    Pyrexia (fever) is an increased core body temperature caused by an elevation of the thermal set-point
    
    Hyperthermia refers to an increase in core body temperature above the thermal set-point
    
- What are pyrogens? How do pyrogens cause fever?
    
    Pyrogens are substances that cause fever (e.g. bacteria toxin)
    
    Pyrogens stimulate macrophages and endothelial cells to secret pyrogenic cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF)
    
    Pyrogenic cytokines stimulate the synthesis of prostaglandin PGE2 in the hypothalamus, which elevate the thermal set-point
    
    As core body temperature is lower than the elevated thermal set-point, a myriad of physiological responses to increase heat production and reduce heat loss
    
    Core body temperature increases, causing fever
    
- What are characteristics of febrile conditions?
    
    When set point is raised to a higher value, set point is greater than poor body temperature
    
    Hence, patients present with chills
    
    In response to the elevated set point, vasoconstriction, piloerection, epinephrine secretion occurs to raise body temperature
    
    Shivering occurs, hence, patients present with rigors
    
    When immune cells stop releasing pyrogenic cytokines, the set point is restored, and body temperature is greater than the set point
    
    Hence, patients feel hot
    
    In response to the reduced set point, sweating and vasodilation occurs to lower body temperature
    
    Vasodilation causes patients face to be flushed
    
- What happens during a heat stroke?
    
    Person in a hot humid environment carrying out physical activity is at risk of heat stroke
    
    Core body temperature increases as body fails to lose heat effectively
    
    When core body temperature reaches 41 degrees, thermoregulatory centre is depressed, and core body temperature continues to increase
    
- What are the body changes in response to excessive heat?
    
    People sweat profusely in excessive heat
    
    Hence, they will be depleted of salt and water
    
    This results in dehydration and decreased blood pressure, decreasing blood flow to kidneys, splanchnic region and the brain
    
    Neurological symptoms like fatigue, confusion and unconsciousness may arise due to increased brain temperature and decreased cerebral blood flow
    
- What are the physiological changes to acclimatize to heat?
    
    Increased maximum rate of sweating
    
    Increased plasma volume due to increased aldosterone secretion
    
    Decreased NaCl conc. in sweat and urine due to aldosterone secretion
    

### Hypothermia

- How is hypothermia defined?
    
    Fall in the core body temperature to below 35 degrees Celsius
    
- What are certain symptoms of severe hypothermia?
    
    Impaired consciousness and coma
    
    Death from cardiac arrhythmias or arrest
