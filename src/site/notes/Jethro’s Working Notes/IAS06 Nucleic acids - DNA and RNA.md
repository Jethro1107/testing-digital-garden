## Nucleic acid structure and function

- Learning Outcomes
    
    To describe nucleotide and nucleic acid structure
    
    To discriminate DNA and RNA structure and function
    
- Describe the Structure of double-helical DNA
    
    ![[Page3.jpg\|Page3.jpg]]
    
    2 antiparallel strands, forming a right-handed helix
    
    10.4 bases pairs per turn, 36 degrees each rotation from top view
    
- What is the structure of a nucleotide?
    
    ![[Page4.jpg\|Page4.jpg]]
    
    Nucleotide consist of:
    
    A pentose - ribose or deoxyribose, determined by 2' C
    
    A phosphate
    
    A base - purine or pyrimidine
    
    3' OH group forms phosphodiester bond with the phosphate of the next nucleotide

- Function of DNA and RNA
    - What is the function of DNA?
        
        DNA is only used as a store of genetic information
        
    - What is the Function of RNA?
        
        ![[Page9.jpg\|Page9.jpg]]
        
        RNA has many functions
        
        RNA can be used as:
        
        mRNA. tRNA. ribosomal RNA, sgRNA (Crispr)

## The Central Dogma

- Learning Outcomes
    
    To describe the central dogma of molecular biology and recognize its centrality to medicine
    
    To illustrate the processes of transcription, mRNA processing, and translation
    
- What is the Central Dogma?
    
    The Central Dogma - A philosophy of molecular biology proposed by Francis Crick, illustrating the one way flow of information from DNA to RNA to Protein
    
    Viruses like HIV allows for the reverse transcription to occur, from RNA back to DNA
    
    However, information cannot be returned from protein back to nucleic acids

    ![[Page17.jpg\|Page17.jpg]]
    
- Transcription
    - What are the steps of transcription?
        - Describe the process of initiation
            
            Transcription factors bind to TATA box bind sequence, a specific sequence in the promotor region 25 to 35 bases upstream of the starting point of the gene, forming the mediator protein complex
            
            RNA polymerase binds to the DNA
            
            Mediator protein complex and RNA polymerase forms the transcription initiation complex
            
            Activation proteins in enhancer region thousands of bases away comes in contact with the initiation complex, activating the transcription initiation complex and triggering elongation
            
        - Describe the process of elongation
            
            RNA polymerase runs from 3' to 5' of the template strand, while elongation occurs from 5' to 3' of the nascent mRNA

            ![[Page20.jpg\|Page20.jpg]]
            
        - Describe the process of termination
- RNA processing
    
    ![[Page21.jpg\|Page21.jpg]]
    
    ![[Page22.jpg\|Page22.jpg]]
    
    ![[Page23.jpg\|Page23.jpg]]
    
    3 processes in RNA processing of primary transcript:
    
    5' cap to stabilise the mRNA molecule
    
    3' Poly (A) tail added (Polyadenylation)
    
    Removing introns by splcing
    
- Translation
    
    ![[Page25.jpg\|Page25.jpg]]
    
    ![[Page26.jpg\|Page26.jpg]]
    
    Ribosome run from 5' to 3' of mRNA molecule
    
    mRNA molecule and tRNA molecule is antiparallel

## Regulation of Gene Expression

- Learning Outcomes
    
    To illustrate the packaging of DNA by histones into nucleosomes
    
- Need for regulation of gene expression
    
    ![[Page33.jpg\|Page33.jpg]]
    
    ![[Page34.jpg\|Page34.jpg]]
    
    Different genes are expressed in different cells and in different developmental stages
    
- From DNA to chromatids
    
    ![[Page35.jpg\|Page35.jpg]]
    
    4 types of core histone proteins - H2A, H2B, H3, H4
    
    DNA wrap around histone proteins twice to form a nucleosome
    
    Histone covalent modification regulates gene expression as it results in structural changes in the cores, exposing the DNA to the polymerase
