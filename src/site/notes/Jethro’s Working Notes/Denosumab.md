### Denosumab

Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that is used for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Treatment of osteoporosis\|Treatment of osteoporosis]].

- ********************************MOA of denosumab********************************
    
    Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL (Receptor for activating Nuclear factor-kappaB), preventing the binding of RANKL to RANK on precursor and mature [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoclast\|Osteoclast]].
    
    This inhibits the formation of mature osteoclasts and inhibition of osteoclastic activity, resulting in an antiresporptive effect.
    
    This results in an increase in bone mineral density.
    
- **************************************************Clinical use of denosumab**************************************************
    
    As denosumab is a monoclonal antibody (a protein), oral (PO) is not available.
    
    It is given as a subcutaneous injection every 6 months.
