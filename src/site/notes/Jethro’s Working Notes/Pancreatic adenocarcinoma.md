### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma

- **What is pancreatic adenocarcinoma?**
    
    Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the the most common carcinoma subtype in the pancreas, arising from the ductal epitheium.
    
    It is a cancer with high mortality rate, with a 5-year survival of less than 5%.
    
- **Risk factors of pancreatic adenocarcinoma**
    
    Risk factors include:
    
    - Cigarette smoking
    - Chronic pancreatitis
- **Carcinogenesis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma**
- **Histopathology of pancreatic adenocarcinoma**
    
    Pancreatic adenocarcinoma usually appears as irregular distorted glandular formations with mucin formations, in a wildly infiltrative stroma.

    Tumour cells shows marked malignant cytological changes, there is marked anaplasia (poor differentiation) and frequent mitosis.

- **Clinical features of pancreatic adenocarcinoma**
    
    Pancreatic adenocarcinoma usually presents late, especially if it is in the body and tail.
    
    It commonly results in abdominal pain, weight loss, malaise and anorexia.
    
    Obstructive jaudice may be present early if the tumour is in the head of the pancreas.
    
    It is notorious for its paraneoplastic syndrome, occasionally causing migratory thrombophlebitis and sensory neuropathy.
    
- **Routes of spread of pancreatic adenocarcinoma**
    
    Metastasis by invasive spread - To the liver, peritoneum, omentum and adrenal glands
    
    Metastasis by lymphatic spread - to regional lymph nodes
