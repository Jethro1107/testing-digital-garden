### Drug Metabolism

- What is another name for drug metabolism?
    
    Biotransformation
    
- What is the three significance of drug metabolism?
    1. To terminate the action of drug
        
        Biotransformation of drug into inactive metabolites
        
    2. To activate a prodrug
        
        Prodrug is inactivate, and undergoes biotransformation to generate active metabolites
        
    3. To facilitate the elimination of drugs
        
        Most drugs are lipophilic in nature to promote absorption and distribution, but hinder elimination and excretion
        
        By increasing the size of drug and making the drug more polar to prevent reabsorption back into systemic circulation in kidney tubules, the drug is hence readily excreted from the body
        
- What are the two types of metabolic reaction?
    
    Phase I metabolism: Functionalization reaction
    
    - Introduce or expose a functional group on the paret compound
    - Usually results in a loss of pharmaceutical activity, but may result in rentention or enhancement of activity
    - Prodrugs are designed to maximize absorption and distribution, and converted rapidly into active metabolite in phase I reaction
    
    Phase II metabolism: Conjugation reaction
    
    - Formation of covalent linkage between a functional group on parent compound or phase I metabolite with endogenously derived conjugate like glucuronic acid, sulphate, glutathione, amino acids, or acetate
    - Conjugate are often highly polar, thus reducing renal reabsorption and promoting excretion
- What are the two types of enzymes in phase 1 metabolism?
    
    Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450)
    
    Hydrolytic enzymes (esterase, amidase)
    
- Elaborate on the Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. Where is it found?
    
    A superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins found on Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum of hepatocytes involved in metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds
    
    Functions as a terminal oxidase in a multicomponent electron-transport chain that introduces a single oxygen atom of an oxygen molecule into the substrate, and the remaining oxygen atom being incorporated into water
    
    The electron is supplied from NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase, which is usually closely associated wth CYP450 monooxygenase on smooth ER
    
- What are the typical reactions by CYP450 monooxygenase?
    
    Aromatic and Side chain hydroxylation
    
    N, O and S dealkylation
    
    N-oxidation, N-hydroxylation
    
    Sulfoxidation
    
    Deamination, dehalogenation, desulfuration
    
- Elaborate on the organization and naming of enzymes in the CYP450 family.
    
    Protein sequences that are >40% identical belong in the same family, represented by the first number
    
    Within a family, protein sequence that are.>55% identical belong in the subfamily, represented by the letter
    
    Within the same subfamily, there are individual isoforms, represented by the number
    
    There are 17 families, and about 8-10 isoforms from CYP1 CYP2, and CYP3 family are involved in drug metabolism
    
- Elaborate on the roles of hydrolytic enzymes.
    
    Non-specific esterase and emidases in the ER of hepatocytes
    
    Exposed hydroxyl and amino group after hydrolysis are suitable for conjugation reaction
    
    Microsomal epoxide hydrolase is located near CYP450 in ER to hydrolyze arene oxide into diols
    
    They may also be protease or peptidase
    
- What are the different types of conjugation reaction?
    
    Glucuronidation (most important):
    
    Conjugates glucuronic acid to phase I metabolites
    
    Mediated by UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)
    
    Cytosolic sulfonation:
    
    Conjugate iorganic sulphur to phase I metabolites
    
    Mediated by sulfotransferases (STs)
    
    Acetylation:
    
    Conjugate acetate to phase I metabolites:
    
    Mediated by N-acetyltranferases
    
    May result in less soluble metabolites, resulting in crystalluria
    
- What are the genetic factors affecting drug metabolism?
    
    Due to allelic variants (Genetic polymorphism if sufficient)
    
    Can cause inhibit or enhance activity
    

### Drug Elimination

- What is drug excretion?
    
    Elimination of drug from the body either unchanged, or by conversion into metabolites
    
- What types of compound do excretory organs favor in elimination?
    
    Polar, hydrophilic compounds
    
- What are the different organs that play a role in excretion?
    
    Major organ: Kidneys
    
    Bile, GI tract, lungs (for gas phase drugs)
    
- What are the different forces that are at play in renal excretion of drugs?
    
    Glomerular filtration:
    
    Only unbound drug can be filtered into the glomerulus
    
    Active tubular secretion:
    
    In proximal renal tubule, drugs may be secreted into tubular fluid by active, carrier-mediated transport
    
    Transporters like P-glycoproteins and Multidrug resistance-associated protein-type 2 (MRP2) are involved in active tubular secretion of conjugated metabolites
    
    Passive tubular reabsorption:
    
    In proximal and distal tubules, drug reabsorption is carried out by passive diffusion and is subjected to ion trapping
    
    Concentration gradient for back diffusion is created by reabsorption of water
    
    In distal tubules, transporters are involved in active reabsorption of drugs into systemic circulation
    
- Describe biliary and fecal excretion of drugs.
    
    Hepatocytes can secret drugs and metabolites into bile via Multidrug resistance-associated protein-type 2 (MRP2), which is for conjugated metabolites
    
    Bile is released into intestinal lumen during digestion
    
    Enterocytes also secret drugs into intestinal lumen via P-glycoprotein
    
    Drugs can then be excreted in faeces
    
- How may gut microbiome affect drug metabolism and excretion?
    
    Enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated metabolites by gut flora may contribute to
