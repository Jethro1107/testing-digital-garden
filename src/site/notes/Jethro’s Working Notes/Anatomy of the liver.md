### Anatomy of the liver

The liver is the largest gland in the body.

- ******Location of the liver******
    
    The liver is well protected by the thoracic cage, and is usually not palpable even with inspiration.
    
    It occupies the right hypochondrium, epigasrium, and a small portion of left hypochondrium.
    
- ******************************************Surfaces of the liver******************************************
    
    The liver consist of a diaphragmatic surface (the superior and anterior surface of the liver), which is in contact with the inferior surface of the diaphragm.
    
    The liver consist of a visceral surface (inferior and posterior surface of the liver), which is in contact with many abdominal viscera.
    
- ******************************************Features of the liver******************************************
    
    On the visceral surface, the liver is marked by an H-shaped structure marked by the porta hepaticus, the ligamentum venosum (embryonic remnant of the ductus venosus), the ligamentum teres (round ligament, embryonic remnant of the umbilical vein), the inferior vena cava and the gallbladder.
    
    This H-shape structure defines the quadrate lobe and caudate lobe.
    
    The quadrate lobe, defined between the ligamentum teres hepatis and gallbladder, is functionally the right lobe of the liver.
    
    The caudate lobe, defined by the ligamentum venosum and inferior vena cava, is functionally distinct from the left lobe and right lobe.

- ********************************************Ligaments of the liver********************************************
    
    On the diaphragmatic surface, the liver is covered with visceral peritoneum, except of an area called the bare area.
    
    The bare area is demarcated by peritoneal folds that suspend the liver to the diaphragm:
    
    - The anterior and posterior coronary ligament, which converge on the right to give the right triangular ligament, and diverge towards the left to form the bare area.
    - The anterior coronary ligament is continuous with the falciform ligament (which encloses the round ligament), while the posterior coronary ligament is continuous with the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Lesser omentum\|Lesser omentum]].
    - To the left extremity of the liver, the anterior and posterior ligaments converge to form the left triangular ligament.
