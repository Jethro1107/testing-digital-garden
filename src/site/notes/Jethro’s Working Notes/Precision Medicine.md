### Precision medicine (and precision prevention)

**Precision medicine** is the promise of ****giving the right treatment, at the right dose for the right patient at the right time for the right outcome,**** i.e. ********************************************Personalised medicine.********************************************

- **The application of precision medicine is associated with a host of benefits:**
    1. Reduced morbidity and mortality with tailored treatments
    2. Earlier diagnosis
    3. Better targeting of resources
    4. Cost saving (due to fewer adverse drug reactions and shorter hospital stays)

### The Human genome

- [[Packaging of the human genome\|Packaging of the human genome]]
    - The human genome consist of 3 billion base pairs, packaged into a nucleus
    - To enable packaging in such a small space, the human genome is packaged into [[chromosomes\|chromosomes]]
        - Chromosomes consist of a p arm (short arm) and a q arm (long arm), which is joined at the centromere
    - The human genome is a diploid (paired chromosomes), consisting of 23 pairs of chromosomes (22 paired autosomes, 1 paired allosomes)
    - In [[The Human genome\|The Human genome]], 1.2% of base pairs consist of of around 20000 genes
- [[Properties of a functional genome\|Properties of a functional genome]]
    - A functional genome must be organised
    - A functional genome must be usable (able to be regulated and expressed)
    - A functional genome must be stable
    - A functional genome must be able to replicated accurately to the progeny cells
- [[genetic variations\|genetic variations]]
    - What is [[genetic variations\|genetic variations]]?
        - Genetic variations are differences in DNA among individuals or cells
    - Different types of [[genetic variations\|genetic variations]]
        - [[Copy number variations\|Copy number variations]]
            - Gain or loss of whole or arm of chromosome
        - [[Structural variations\|Structural variations]]
            - Involves deletion, duplication translocation and inversion of a segment of chromosome
        - [[Sequence level variations\|Sequence level variations]]
            - [[Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)\|Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)]]
            - Insertion or deletion of bases
    - [[Methods of detecting genetic variations\|Methods of detecting genetic variations]]
        - [[Classical 'Sanger' dideoxy sequencing\|Classical 'Sanger' dideoxy sequencing]]
            - Sangar sequencing is used for sequencing of DNA sequences of 500-800bp
            - It is invented by [[Frederick Sangar\|Frederick Sangar]] in 1977
            - **[[Principles of Sangar sequencing\|Principles of Sangar sequencing]]**
                - Sangar sequencing is based on the principle that 3'OH is required for DNA elongation
                - It involves amplification of DNA, where dNTP (deoxynucleotides) is mixed with ddNTP (dideoxynucleotides)
                - When ddNTP is incorporated into the growing nucleotide chain, it results in chain termination due to the lack of 3'OH
                - This results in formation sequences of different sizes, which can be separated by gel electrophoresis to work out the sequence
        - [[Sequencing by synthesis\|Sequencing by synthesis]] is one of the more popular [[Next generation sequencing techniques\|Next generation sequencing techniques]]
            - **[[Next generation sequencing techniques have certain advantages over Sangar sequencing\|Next generation sequencing techniques have certain advantages over Sangar sequencing]]**
                - Higher accuracy
                - Higher throughput
                - Higher read length
                - Higher speed
                - Lower cost
            - **Steps to [[sequencing by synthesis\|sequencing by synthesis]]**
                - DNA preparation - DNA sequence is primed with adaptors and barcodes
                - Amplication - amplication of clusters of sequence
                - Sequencing
                - Florescence-labelled and terminally blocked nucleotide is added
                - Flow cell is imaged to determine the base added
                - Florescence is cleaved to regenerate 3'OH, enable the addition of the next nucleotide

### Genetic inheritance and diseases

- [[Mendelian disorders\|Mendelian disorders]]
    - [[Mendelian disorders\|Mendelian disorders]] refers to diseases in which inheritance patterns are clear by simple rules of dominance and recessiveness
    - This disorders are caused by by inheritance of allelic variant(s) on a single gene
    - Diseases may be inherited in an [[autosomal dominant\|autosomal dominant]] pattern or an [[autosomal recessive\|autosomal recessive]] patterns
    - Autosomal dominant recessive disorders
        - Autosomal dominant disorders only require 1 copy of the mutant allele
        - Hence, all carriers (no matter carying one or two copies) are affected
        - If one parent is heterozygous, and the other is homologous recessive, there is a 1 in 2 chance
        - The onset of autosomal dominant disorders often occurs late in life after the individual has completed reproduction to pass on the mutated allele
    - Autosomal recessive disorders
        - Autosomal recessive disorders are disorders that require 2 copies of the mutated allele Hence, it only affects homozygotes If both parents are heterozygotes, there is a 1 in 4 chance of inheritance
    - [[The severity of mendelian disorders can vary across individuals of the same genotype\|The severity of mendelian disorders can vary across individuals of the same genotype]]
        - This is caused by a difference if penetrance and expressivity of the genotype
        - Penetrance concerns whether people with the genotype develop the disorder
        - Expressivity describes to the phenotypical variance in terms of severity
- [[Sex-linked disorders\|Sex-linked disorders]]
    - [[X chromosome\|X chromosome]] and [[Y chromosome\|Y chromosome]]
        - The X chromosome encodes around 800 genes that regulate functions in **BOTH** males and females
        - [[Dosage compensation by X inactivation\|Dosage compensation by X inactivation]] is mechanism that cause females to be genetically mosaics
        - The Y chromosome is thought to be a descendent of an autosome that lacked a homologous pair
        - The Y chromosome has experienced massive gene loss, and only expresses very little genes (50)
        - It carries the SRY gene, which is the master gene for sex determination. Hence, [[Sex determinance in humans is determined by allosomes\|Sex determinance in humans is determined by allosomes]]
    - [[X-linked disorders\|X-linked disorders]]
        - X-linked disorders are disorders that involve genes on the X chromosome, where males and females are affected
        - X-link disorders mostly recessive and often affect males, as they only carry one X chromosome
        - X-linked disorders can deviate from clear cut dominant or recessiveness due to Dosage compensation by X inactivation. This is why heterozygous females may develop the disorder.
    - [[Y-linked disorders\|Y-linked disorders]]
        - Y-linked disorders is an extremely rare Sex-linked disorders which involves genes on the Y chromosome where only males are affected
        - Many Y-linked disorders are associated with Spermatogenic failure, thus impeding the carrier from fathering children to propagate the gene
        - Hence, they are usually caused by de novo germline mutations
- [[Mitochondrial disorders\|Mitochondrial disorders]]

### Population genetics

### Hereditability

- Traits may be monogenic, polygenic and multifactorial
    - Monogenic traits - Traits that are controlled by one gene
    - Polygenic traits - Traits that are controlled by more than one gene
    - Multifactorial traits - Traits that are controlled by genes and other factors
- Concept of hereditability
    - Hereditability refers to the perentage of variation explained by genetics
- Hereditability of height (Nature vs Nurture)
    - Height is a multifactorial trait
    - Hereditability of height - 60-80%
    - Other factors (nutrition, diseases) - 20-40%

### Prenatal/Newborn screening

- [[Genetic testing is conducted in 3 phases\|Genetic testing is conducted in 3 phases]]
    - pre-implantation testing (for in vitro firtilization)
        - The objective is to find viable embryos post IVF for implantation
        - pre-implantation testing is classified into [[pre-implantation genetic screening\|pre-implantation genetic screening]] and [[pre-implantation genetic diagnosis\|pre-implantation genetic diagnosis]]
    - pre-natal (during pregnancies)
        - New challenges arise in pre-natal testing, as it requires accessing of fetal cells via invasive routes
        - However, discovery of fetal cell free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal DNA
    - post birth

### Rare disease diagnosis

- [[Rare diseases as a group are not rare\|Rare diseases as a group are not rare]]
    - Case study: [[Nick Volker\|Nick Volker]] [[Book - One in a billion\|Book - One in a billion]]

### Direct to consumer genetic testing

- Direct to consumer genetic testing reports on risk of diseases and pocession of traits, they also provide drug response prediction, carrier status and ancestry information
- Important considerations when using DTC genetic testing
    - Most calculated risk is based on a reference population, hence must consider whether reference population is appropriate for a particular individual
    - Reference populations nowadays usually europeans
    - Non-genetic factors complicate risk prediction
- Companies providing DTC genetic testing
    - 23andMe (microarray)
        - Saliva sample
        - Choice of technology
            - Microarray
            - Testing specific loci
            - Extremely high accuracy at a low price
        - European bias in variant selection
    - Circle DNA (sequencing)
        - Choice of technology
            - Sequencing of regions of the genome
            - Reasonable accuracy but a much higher cost
- Basis of genetic testing
    - Based on **prior data** reporting on genotype-phenotype associated, maybe monogenic traits, polygenic traits and multifactorial traits
    - Data comes from publishments, but companies like 23andme and circleDNA collect data themselves from donors

    - i.e. your risk = average risk * likelihood ratio derived from allelic model

### Cancer somatic testing

- [[Cancer is caused by somatic mutations\|Cancer is caused by somatic mutations]]
- Cancer somatic mutation testing tests for drugable mutations in cancer cells to inform the use of target therapy
    - target therapy e.g. Imatinib targets BCR/ABL fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukemia

- Only a number of cancer driver genes (100-400) are sequenced by [[Next generation sequencing techniques\|Next generation sequencing techniques]] for 2 reasons
    - Certain genes are unlikely to be important for cancer development
    - There are no targetted therapy available for certain mutations
- If more than one actionable mutations is found, may refer to a molecular tumour board to see best course of action

### Evaluation of genetic testing

- ACCE framework for evaluation of genetic tests:
    - Analytical validity
        - Accuracy and reliability of the assay to measure or detect the genotype of interest
    - Clinical validity
        - Ability to distinguish those who will develop the disorder and who will remain healthy
        - Associated by association of genotype and phenotype
            - Affected by mode of inheritance, penetrance, expressivity, gene-gene interaction and gene-environment interaction
    - Clinical utility
        - Potential benefit conferred from test result, and how it adds to patient management
        - The availability of alternative diagnostic procedures
    - Ethical, legal and social implications
        - Potential harm that may be related to the testing result

### Genetics of Cardiopulmonary diseases

- Genetic testing for cardiac diseases
    - Genetics of cardiac diseases
        - Many are monogenetic, with high penetrance
        - Most have late onset, thus enabling an individual to pass on the mutation
    - Many diseases have high diagnostic rate based on a handful of genes
    - These genes with high detection rate are first line in genetic testing for cardiac diseases
    - If these yield unremarkable results, may conduct a more comprehensive test
    - **Identifying the pathogenic varient will inform predictive genetic testing in familiy**
    - How to discriminate pathogenic varients and benign varients? TTN genes as example
        - ACMG (american college of medical genetics and genomics) recommendation for variant classification
            - Pathogenic - multiple families with the same varient having the same disease, and pathogenicity demonstrated in vivo or in vitro experiments
            - Benign - Observed in large number of health individuals
            - What about those in between (different predictive elements are in disagreement)
        - ACMG guidelines for incidental findings (what to do if the gene is unassociated with patients condition) - there is a list of genes in this guidelines, many of which are cardiac related
    - What is the impact of variants of **unknown significance?**
        - They may have clinical significance
- How precision medicine can guide care for patients with cardiopulmonary diseases
    - Cystic fibrosis as an example
    - Pathogenesis of CF
        - Due to mutation of CFTR gene, pumps Cl- onto cell surface
        - Impaired Cl- secretion causes impaired hydration of airways
        - Thickened mucous results in obstruction of airways
    - Genetics of CF
        - Mendelian disorder, autosomal recessive inheritance
        - 2000 different mutations, which guides drug treatment
            - Class I - synthesis of CFTR
            - Class II - protein maturation
            - Class III - gating of ion channels
            - Class IV - ion channel conduction
            - Class V - reduced protein
    - Precision medicine helps identify the genotype, which guides personalised treatment
    - Different drugs for different class of drugs
- Stem cell models tailor treatment for heart disease
    - Long QT syndrome as example
    - Electropathology of LQTS
        - LQTS prolongs QT intervals, predisposing to fatal ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes
        - Congenital LQTS is caused by mutations of ion channels in cardiac cells
    - LQTS type 2
        - Autosomal dominant
        - Mutations in voltage gated potassium channels (decrease outward potassium current)
    - Different mutations that have different functional effects, however currently no mutation specific drugs
    - 
    - Biopsy of dermal fibroblast -> reprogram into induced pluripotent stem cells -> trigger differentiation into cardiomyocytes -> Model the disease of LQT2 -> Use these stem cell models to develop mutation-specific treatment for LQT2
    - 
- From monogenic to multifactorial traits
    - CAD - a multifactorial disease, not a mendelian disorder
    - Conscious lifestyle choices have a significant impact on patients
    - CAD has heritability of 40-50%, i.e. patients with family history of CAD is at a higher risk
    - Framingham Risk Score - quite robust prediction model to predict risk for CAD
        - Consist of modifiable and non-modifiable factors
    - Genetics - around 60 loci associated
        - 20% of genes associated with LDL metabolism
        - Some genes are associated with blood pressure control
        - Some of these mutations give us key information therapeutic consequences
            - Patients associated with PCSK9 loss of function have an 88% lower risk of CAD
            - Hence PCSK9 can be a suitable therapeutic target

### Cardiovascular health technologies

- Proteomics and metabolomics
    - Mass spectrometry
- IoT
- AI in imaging

### Lung cancer in the age of precision medicine

- Cancer somatic testing can be done via: 1) PCR-based method, FISH-based method and NGS-based tests
