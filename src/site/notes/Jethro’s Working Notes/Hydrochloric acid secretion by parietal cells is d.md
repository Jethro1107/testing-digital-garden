### Hydrochloric acid secretion by parietal cells is driven by an ionic mechanism

In a resting state, the cytoplasm of unstimulated parietal cells contains numerous tubules and vesicles, known as the **tubulovesicular system**, which consist of the key pump that drives hydrochloric acid secretion, **omeprazole-sensitive** **H+/K+ ATPase**.

Upon stimulation ([[The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine\|The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine]]), the cytoskeletal rearrangement occurs to shuttle the tubulovesicles to the apical secretory canaliculi, enabling acid secretion.

The ionic mechanism to drive hydrochloric acid secretion is described below:

1. Under the action of cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase, carbon dioxide combines with water to give H2CO3, which dissociates to give H+ and HCO3-
2. H+ is secreted into lumen of canaliculi via H+/K+ ATPase
3. HCO3- is pumped out of parietal cells via Cl-/HCO3- exchanger for interstitial Cl-, which leaves the apical membrane via apical Cl- channels.
4. Accumulation of H+ in the lumen of canaliculi creates an osomotic gradient, driving osmosis of water into the lumen. This results in a pH less than 2.
