### Electromyogram (EMG)

Electromyogram is a diagnostic procedure that measures the health of muscles and motor neurons, and can measure motor unit recruitment ([[Muscle tension is dependent on motor unit recruitment\|Muscle tension is dependent on motor unit recruitment]]).

It converts the electrical signals into readable signals.

Signals from different motor units look different.

Increase in muscle strength results in recruitment of more motor units and an increase in frequency of activation of each motor unit.

    Surface EMG is noon-invasive, but only provides a limited assessment of muscle activities as the recordings are restricted to superficial muscles.
    
    Intramuscular EMG is an invasive procedure that involves insertion of needle through the skin and muscles. It is a common diagnostic procedure for neuromuscular disorders.
