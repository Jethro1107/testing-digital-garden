### Autonomic Nervous system

- Classification of nervous system
    - **Anatomical classification of nervous system**
        - The nervous system is classified anatomically into the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS)
        - The CNS consist of the brain and the spinal cord
        - The PNS consist of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves and the 31 pairs spinal nerves
    - **Functional classification of nervous system**
        - The nervous system is classified functionally into the somatic nervous system (SoNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
        - The SoNS is further classified into its sensory and voluntary motor divisions
        - The autonomic nervous system is further classified into its parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions (involuntary visceral everents)
- Organization of autonomic nervous system
    - **Classification of autonomic nervous system**
        - Sympathetic division
        - Parasympathetic division
    - **Functions of the two autonomic nervous system divisions**
        - Sympathetic division is responsible for flight and fight, and is involved in consuming energy
        - Parasympathetic division is responsible for rest and digest, and is involved in restoring energy
    - **Outflow of different divisions of autonomic nervous system**
        - The sympathetic division has thorocolumbar outflow, in which preganglionic sympathetic fibers arise from nuclei of the lateral grey horn of the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar region
        - The parasympathetic division has craniosarcal outflow, in which preganglionic parasympathetic fibers arise from nuclei of brain stem and sarcal region of the spinal cord
    - **Autonomic nerve supply of the head and neck region**
        - **Parasympathetic supply:**
            - Eyes - CN III (oculomotor nerve)

        - **Sympathetic supply:**
            - Eyes, lacrimal glands, submandibular glands and sublingual glands, parotid gland - Sympathetic fibers arising from T1-T2, passing through sympathetic chain ganglion and celiac ganglion and supplying the target structures

### Mediastinum

- **What is the mediastinum?**
    - The mediastinum refers to a broad central location that separates two laterally placed pleural cavities
    - It is bounded anteriorly and posteriorly by the sternum and body of vertebrae
    - It is bounded superiorly and inferiorly by the superior thoracic aperture and the diaphragm
    - it is bounded laterally by the two pleural cavities
