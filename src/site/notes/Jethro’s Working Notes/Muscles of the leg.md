### Muscles of the leg

The muscles of the leg are separated into the anterior compartment, lateral compartment, and posterior compartment by the anterior intermuscular septum, posterior intermuscular sepum and interosseous membrane.

All 13 muscles of the legs are considered as extrinsic muscles of the foot, with the exception of the politeus, which acts on the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Knee joint\|Knee joint]].

### Anterior compartment of the leg

The anterior compartment of the leg are mainly dorsiflexors of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ankle joint\|Ankle joint]] and extensors of the digits. They may also invert or evert the foot (at the [[Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex\|Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex]] complex]]?), depending on its insertion.

There are 4 muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg: 1) ************Tibialis anterior,************ 2) **************************Extensor hallucis longus,************************** 3) ********************************Extensor digitorum longus******************************** and 4) ********************Peroneus (fibularis) tertius.********************

Collectively, they dorsiflex the ankle, extend the toes, and can cause inversion and eversion of the foot. They are all innervated by the deep fibular nerve.

- **********************************Tibialis anterior**********************************
    
    The tibialis anterior is the most anterior and medial muscle of the anterior compartment of the leg.
    
    The tibialis anterior originates from the lateral surface of the tibia and adjacent interosseous membrane, and descends on the medial side of the leg. It then inserts at the medial and inferior surface of the medial cuniforms and base of 1st metatarsal bone.
    
    It enables dorsiflexion and inversion at the ankle joint.
    
- ******************Extensor digitorum longus******************
    
    The extensor digitorum longus is the most posterior and lateral muscle of the anterior compartment of the leg.
    
    It originates from the medial surface of the fibula and adjacent interossous membrane. Distally, it forms a tendon that branches into 4 tendons, one for each of the 4 lateral toes, which insert into the dorsal extensor expansion of digits 2-5 (i.e. at the bases of the middle and distal phalanges).
    
    The extensor digitorum longus enables extension of digits 2-5.
    
- ******Extensor hallucis longus******
    
    The extensor hallucis longus is lateral to, and partly overlapped by the tibialis anterior muscle.
    
     It originates from the medial surface of the fibula and adjacent interosseous membrane (*slightly lower than the origin of the extensor digitorum longus*), and inserts at the base of the distal phalanx of the big toe.
    
    It enables extension of the big toe.
    
- ******Peroneus (fibularis) tertius******
    
    The fibularis tertius is a vestigal muscles, in a sense that it is absent in some individuals.
    
    The fibularis tertius is usually considered as a part of the extensor digitorum longus, as it originates from the medial side of the fibula, just below the origin of the extensor digitorum longus.
    
    It produces a tendon that inserts at the dorsal side of the 5th metacarpal.
    
    It enables eversion of the foot.

### Lateral compartment of the leg

The lateral compartment of the leg are mainly everters. There are two muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg, the more superficial ****************************Peroneus (fibularis) longus,**************************** and the deeper ****************Peroneus (fibularis) brevis.****************

Together, they evert the ankle. They are both innervated by the *****************superficial fibular nerve.*****************

- ******************************Peroneus longus******************************
    
    The fibularis longus is the superficial muscle. It originates from the upper parts of the lateral surface of the fibula, and produces a tendon that wraps around the lateral side of cuboid onto the plantar surface of the foot. It then inserts onto the medial cuniform and the plantar surface of the base of 1st metatarsal.
    
- ******************************Peroneus brevis******************************
    
    The fibularis brevis lies deep to the fibularis longus. It originates from the lower parts of the lateral surface of the fibula, and inserts on the tuberosity at the base of 5th metatarsal.
    

Note that the tendons of both muscles are held down by the peroneal retinacula, a ligament between the lateral side of the tallus and calcaneus.

### Posterior compartment of the leg

The posterior compartment of the leg are mainly enable plantarflexion of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ankle joint\|Ankle joint]] and the flexion of digits. It is made of a superficial layer and deep layer.

- The superficial layer consist of 3 muscles that enables plantar flexion of the ankle joint: 1) **************Gastronemius,************** 2) ********Soleus,******** 3) *************Plantaris.************* The gastronemius and soleus muscle form the **triceps surae**.
    - **************Gastronemius**************
        
        The gastronemius is the calf muscle we all want but cannot pocess.
        
        The gastronemius has 2 heads:
        
        - The medial head originates from above the medial condyle femur
        - The lateral head originates from above the lateral condyle of the femur
        
        The two heads fuse to form a single muscle belly (the calf), and **forms a long tendon with the muscle fibres of the soleus deep to it** (the longest tendon in the body), the Tendo calcaneus, or the achilles tendon, and inserts onto the posterior surface of the calcaneus.
        
        It enables **plantarflexion** of the ankle joint. As it crosses the knee joint, posteriorly, it also enables **flexion** of the knee joint.
        
    - ************Soleus************
        
        The soleus lies deep to the gastronemius. It originates from the tibia and fibula (*Note that the soleus forms a **tendinous arch** near its origin*), and inserts at the posterior surface of the calcaneus via the tendo calcaneus.
        
        It enables plantar flexion of the ankle joint.
        
    - ******************Plantaris******************
        
        The plantaris is a small muscle with a small muscle belly and a long tendon. It originates from the lower part of the lateral supracondylar ridge, just above the lateral condyle of the femur, and produces a long tendon that inserts at the posterior surface of the calcaneus, medial to the tendo calcaneus.
        
        It enables plantarflexion of the ankle joint. As it crosses the knee joint, posteriorly, it also enables flexion of the knee joint.
        
- The deep layer consist of 4 muscles: 1) *********Popliteus*********, 2) ***********************Flexor digitorum longus,*********************** 3) ********************Tibialis posterior,******************** 4) **********Flexor hallucis longus.**********
    - ******************Popliteus******************
        
        The popliteus lies superior to the other 3 muscles of the deep group of the posterior compartment of the leg. It originates from the lateral surface of the lateral condyle of the femur, and inserts at the posterior surface of the tibia, above the soleal line.
        
        It is involved in unlocking the extended knee, and is involved in flexion of the knee joint.
        
    - ****************************************Flexor digitorum longus****************************************
        
        The flexor digitorum longus is the most medial muscle of the deep group of the posterior compartment of the leg.
        
        It originates from the medial side of the posterior surface of the tibia, and forms a tendon that crosses the tendon of the tibialis posterior at the ankle joint.
        
        The tendon of the flexor digitorum passes in a groove near the medial malleolus, the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tarsal tunnel\|Tarsal tunnel]], and turns into the plantar surface of the foot, crossing the tendon of the flexor haullicus longus inferiorly, and splits into 4 tendons, which insert the **base of the distal phalanges** of digits 2-5.
        
        It enables flexion of the toes at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints of digits 2-5.
        
    - ************************************Tibialis posterior************************************
        
        The tibialis posterior lies lateral to the flexor digitorum longus, and originates from the interosseous membrane, and adjacent surfaces of the tibia and fibula. It produces a long tendon that passes deep to the tendon of flexor digitorum longus in the tarsal tunnel.
        
        The tendon curls beneath the medial malleolus and inserts on the tuberosity of the navicular and neighbouring bones.
        
        It enables plantarflexion and inversion at the [[Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex\|Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex]] complex]].
        
    - ************************Flexor hallucis longus************************
        
        The flexor hallucis lies lateral to the tibialis posterior.
        
        It originates from the lateral side of the posterior surface of the fibula, and forms a tendon that passes through the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tarsal tunnel\|Tarsal tunnel]], where it crosses the tendons of flexor digitorum longus superiorly and inserts onto the plantar surfaces of the base of the distal phalanx of the big toe.
        
        It enables flexion of the big toe at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint of the big toe.
