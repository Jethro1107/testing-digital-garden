### Pathogenesis and pathology of rheumatoid arthritis

- ****************************************************************************************************Pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis****************************************************************************************************
    
    Rheumatoid arthritis involves a sensitization phase (1st hit) at the mucosal level, and an activation phase (2nd hit) at the joint level.
    
    Exposure to an environmental allergen in a genetically predisposed individual at the mucosal level results in the presentation of citrullinated proteins by antigen presenting cells and dendritic cells to lymphocytes, resulting in the production of Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). These autoantibodies are be present before the onset of disease (which start with the 2nd hit at the joint level).
    
    Minor trauma to the joints results in increased expression of citrullinated proteins (such as type II collagen and vimentin), which are attacked by ACPA.
    
    ACPA triggers:
    
    - Macrophage infiltration, which releases pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1.
    - Osteoclast activation
    - Synovial cell proliferation
    - Fibroblast proliferation
    
    Eventually, a pannus, which consist of grannulation tissue, osteoclasts, and edematous synovium erodes through the articular cartilage.

    There is proliferation of synovium into polypoidal or papillary fronds.
