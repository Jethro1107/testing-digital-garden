### Adrenergic Receptors of the Sympathetic Nervous System

- What are the five types of adrenergic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system and their effects upon activation?
    
    alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, beta-3
    
    Alpha-1 (Acts on blood vessels and smooth muscles):
    
    - Vasoconstriction
    - Contraction of smooth muscles, except for GI smooth muscles, which relax
    
    Alpha-2 (presynaptic terminal on ganglionic neuron):
    
    - Decreases presynaptic noradrenaline release
    
    Beta-1 (Acts on heart):
    
    - Increased contractility of heart (stroke volume)
    - Increased heart rate
    
    Beta-2 (Acts on blood vessels and smooth muscles):
    
    - Vasodilation
    - Relaxation of smooth muscles (including GI)
    
    Beta-3 (Acts on bladder):
    
    - Relaxes bladder smooth muscles
- Describe the control of the blood pressure.
    
    Blood Pressure = Heart Rate x Stroke Volume x Peripheral resistance
    
    Stroke volume is related to contractility of the heart, controlled by beta-1 receptors
    
    Heart rate is controlled by beta-1 receptors and reflex action:
    
    Beta-1 receptor activation results in increased heart rate
    
    When blood vessels over constrict, the baroreceptors signals the brain to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in bradycardia
    
    Peripheral resistance is affected by the activity of alpha-1 (vasoconstriction) and beta-2 (vasodilation) receptors:
    
    There are more alpha-1 receptors on blood vessels than beta-2 receptors
    

### Sympathomimetics

- What are sympathomimetics? What are the two different modes of action?
    
    Mimics the action of sympathetic nervous system activation
    
    Modes of action:
    
    Direct activation of receptors (agonists)
    
    Indirect - Increase release of neurotransmitters, or decrease rate of breakdown or removal of neurotransmitters
    
- Give two example of a non-selective adrenoreceptor agonist. Explain its effects and its clinical uses.
    
    **Adrenaline (high affinity to beta-2 receptors over alpha-1 receptors)**
    
    A non-selective adrenoreceptor agonist (activates both alpha and beta receptors)
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Stimulates beta-1 receptors, causing stroke volume and heart rate to increase, cardiac output increase
    
    Stimulation on beta-2 receptors is greater than beta-1 receptors (high affinity to beta-2 receptors over alpha-1 receptors overcome the greater number of alpha-1 receptors over beta-2 receptors), causing minor vasodilation, and a small drop in peripheral resistance
    
    Cardiac output increases, peripheral resistance decrease, blood pressure increase
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Beta-2 receptors predominates over alpha-1 receptors, and adrenaline has higher affinity for beta-2 receptors over alpha-1 receptors. hence stimulates beta-2 receptor over alpha-1 receptor, causing relaxation of smooth muscles
    
    Clinical uses:
    
    Anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, asthma
    
    **Noradrenaline (higher affinity to alpha-1 receptors over beta-2 receptors)**
    
    A non-selective adrenoreceptor agonist
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Stimulates beta-1 receptor, causing stroke volume and heart rate to increase, cardiac output increase
    
    As alpha-1 receptor predominates and noradrenaline has a higher affinity to alpha-1 receptors, stimulation of alpha-1 receptor over beta-2 receptor, causing vasoconstriction and increased peripheral resistance
    
    Cardiac output increase, peripheral resistance increase, and hence blood pressure increases significantly
    
    Increase in blood pressure causes reflex bradycardia, heart rate decreases and hence blood pressure decreases slightly, but remains high
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Beta-2 receptors predominate smooth muscles, but noradrenaline has a low affinity to beta-receptor, resulting in only a slight relaxation
    
    Clinical uses:
    
    Hypotension in ICU
    
- Give two example of selective alpha-1 receptor agonists. Explain its effects and its clinical uses.
    
    **Phenylephrine, Oxymetazoline**
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Stimulate alpha-1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction, increasing peripheral resistance, causing increase in blood pressure
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Causes smooth muscles to contract, except for GI smooth muscles
    
    Clinical uses:
    
    Nasal decongestant, by constricting blood vessels in the nose
    
- Give an example of selective alpha-2 receptor agonist. Explain its effects and its clinical uses.
    
    **Clonidine**
    
    Inhibits the presynaptic release of noradrenaline
    
    Acts on CNS to reduce sympathetic activity
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Decreased beta-1 receptor stimulation, heart rate and stroke volume decrease, cardiac output decrease
    
    Alpha-1 receptor predominates in blood vessels, and noradrenaline has higher affinity to alpha-1 receptor, hence, decreased noradrenaline release would cause decreased alpha-1 receptor stimulation, causing vasodilation, causing peripheral resistance to decrease
    
    Cardiac output and peripheral resistance decrease, hence, blood pressure decrease
    
    Clinical use:
    
    Treat hypertension
    
- Give an example of non-selective beta receptor agonist. Explain its effects and its clinical uses.
    
    **Isoproterenol (isoprenaline)**
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Stimulate beta-1 receptor, heart rate and stroke volume increase, cardiac output increase
    
    Stimulate beta-2 receptor, vasodilation occurs, causing peripheral resistance to decrease
    
    Cardiac output increase but peripheral resistance decrease, blood pressure decreases slightly
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Stimulate beta-2 receptor, causing relaxation of smooth muscles
    
    Clinical use:
    
    Asthma (no longer used due to side effect of tachycardia)
    
- Give an example of selective beta-1 receptor agonist. Explain its effects and its clinical use.
    
    **Dobutamine**
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Stimulate Beta-1 receptor, stroke volume and heart rate increase, cardiac output increase, blood pressure increase
    
    Clinical use:
    
    Treat hypotension and heart failure
    
- Give an example of selective beta-2 receptor agonist. Explain its effects and its clinical use.
    
    **Terbutaline and Salbutamol**
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Stimulate beta-2 receptor, causing vasodilaiton, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance
    
    Blood pressure decreaes
    
    Effects on smooth muscle:
    
    Stimulate beta-2 receptors, causing relaxation of smooth muscles
    
    Clinical use:
    
    Asthma (as a bronchodilator)
    
- Give example of beta-3 receptor agonist. Explain its effects and its clinical use.
    
    **Mirabegron**
    
    Relaxation of bladder
    
    Clinical use: 
    
    To treat overactive bladder
    
- Give two examples of sympathomimetic amines.
    
    Tyramine and Ephedrine
    
    Both increase noradrenaline release through norepinephrine transporter
    

### Sympatholytics

- What is sympatholytics? What are the two modes of action?
    
    Reduces the action of sympathetic nervous system
    
    Direct - By blocking receptor activation (as receptor agonists)
    
    Indirect - By inhibiting the release of noradrenaline
    
- Explain are the effects of non-selective alpha receptor antagonists and its clinical uses.
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Block alpha-1 receptor, causing in decreased vasoconstriction, resulting in vasodilation, causing decreased blood pressure
    
    Decreased blood pressure results in reverse tachycardia
    
    Blocked alpha-2 receptor results in increased noradrenaline release, which can cause reverse tachycardia
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Blocked alpha-1 receptors, causing relaxation of smooth muscles
    
    Clinical use:
    
    Treat phaeochromocytoma (cancer in adrenal glands)
    
    Beta blockers used concurrently to control heart rate
    
- Explain are the effects of selective alpha-1 receptor antagonists and its clinical uses.
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Blocked alpha-1 receptor, causing decreased vasoconstriction, resulting in vasodilation, and hence, decreased blood pressure
    
    Decreased blood pressure results in reflex tachycardia
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Blocked alpha-1 receptors, results in decreased contraction of smooth muscles, resulting in relaxation
    
    Clinical use:
    
    Hypertension
    
- Explain are the effects of selective alpha-2 receptor antagonists and its clinical uses.
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Blocked alpha-2 receptor, results in increased noradrenaline release
    
    Noradrenaline can increase cardiac output and result in vasoconstriction, causing increased blood pressure
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Noradrenaline released, results in relaxation of smooth muscles slightly (since beta-2 receptors predominate in smooth muscle, but noradrenaline has low affinity to beta-2 receptors
    
    Not used clinically, since more practical to administer noradrenaline
    
- Explain are the effects of non-selective beta receptor antagonists and its clinical uses.
    
    Block beta-1 and beta-2 receptors equally
    
    Effects on cardiovascular system:
    
    Block beta-1 receptors, causing decreased heart rate, decreased stroke volume, causing cardiac output to decrease
    
    Blocked beta-2 receptors, decreased vasodilation, results in vasoconstriction
    
    Overall effect: Slight decrease in blood pressure
    
    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Blocked beta-2 receptors, decreased relaxation, resulting in increased contraction
    
    Clinical use:
    
    Treatment for Angina, cardiac dysarhythmias, hypertension

    Effects on smooth muscles:
    
    Blocked beta-2 receptors, decreased relaxation, increased contraction
    
    Both are undesirable effects, hence, no clinical use
