### Pancreatic secretions

The exocrine pancreas produces two types of secretions that create the pancreatic juice:

- An isotonic, H+ rich fluid containing pancreatic enzymes - Produced by acinar cells
- Large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluid - Produced by ductal cells (centroacinar cells and intercalated ducts)

**Pancreatic acinar cells secret an isotonic, H+ rich fluid containing pancreatic enzymes**

- [[Secretory vesicles in pancreatic acinar cells are highly acidified\|Secretory vesicles in pancreatic acinar cells are highly acidified]]

The bicarbonate secretion by ductal cell performs several functions ([[Functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells\|Functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells]]).
