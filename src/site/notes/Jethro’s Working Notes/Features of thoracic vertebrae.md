### Features of thoracic vertebrae

There are 12 thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12).

- ****************************Vertebral body****************************
    
    The vertebral body of the thoracic vertebrae is heart shaped, with costal facets superiorly and inferiorly that articulate with the head of the ribs.
    
- ************************************Transverse process************************************
    
    The transverse process consist of articular facets for the tubercle of the rib.
    
- ******************************Spinous process******************************
    
    The spinous process of thoracic vertebrae are long, and slopes inferiorly, causing them to overlap one another.
    
- ******************************Articular facet******************************
    
    The articular facets of the superior and inferior articular process face posteriorly and anteriorly respectively, i.e. *The facets are coronally oriented.*

    This limits the range of movement:
    
    - It enables lateral rotation.
    - The coronally oriented facets and articulation with ribs limit flexion, extension and lateral flexion.
