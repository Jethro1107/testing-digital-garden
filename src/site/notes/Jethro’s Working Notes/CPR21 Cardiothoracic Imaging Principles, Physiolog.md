- Principles of radiographs
    - What are radiographs?
        - Radiographs are planar view of the human body
        - There are superimposition of shadows when X-ray beam transverses the body
    - 2 common projection
        - Posterior-anterior projection (standard projection)
            - X-ray hits posterior surface first
            -

        - Anterior-posterior projection
            - X-ray hits anterior surface first (only used when PA projection cannot be obtined)
            -

        - **Rotation and heart size**
            - Heart size can be assessed accurately with a well-aligned posterior-anterior (PA) chest X-ray. If the patient is rotated to their left, then the heart may appear enlarged. If the patient is rotated to their right, then heart size may be underestimated.
            - **Well-aligned patient**
                - An accurate assessment can be made

        - **Rotation and the lungs**
            - Thickness of soft tissues of the chest, such as breast tissue, is altered by rotation. This may give the misleading impression of pathology in the lungs.
            - **Pseudo-blunting of the costophrenic angle**
                - At first glance the left costophrenic angle appears blunt
                - The patient is rotated which results in greater thickness of breast tissue overlying the costophrenic angle on the left compared with the right
                - You may be misled into thinking there is a pleural effusion or other pathology causing costophrenic angle blunting

        - Underpenetration - retrocardial areas to white
        - Overpenetration - retrocardial areas too dark
    - PA vs AP projection
        - Effects on heart size
            - AP projection tends to overestimate heart size as the heart is relatively further from the detector, and the sensor is closer to the patient, such that X-ray is more divergent

        - Effects on quality
            - PA projection generally higher quality than AP projection
        - Effects on scapulae edges
            - PA projection - medial ends of scapula retracted laterally
            - AP projection - medial ends of scapula not retracted laterally
- Correlation of respiratory physiology and CXR - Pneumothorax
    - What is pneumothorax?
        - Abnormal air collection in pleural cavities resulting in ‘collapsed’ lung
    - Effects of pneumothorax
        - Impaired ventilation
        - Disrupted haemodynamic stability
            - Elevated intrapleural pressure exerts a positive pressure and compresses great veins, reducing venous return and thus reducing [[Cardiac Output\|Cardiac Output]]
    - [[Tension Pneumothorax\|Tension Pneumothorax]]
        - Communication of air between lungs and pleural cavity becomes a check valve, where air can enter during inspiration, but cannot escape during expiration
        - Results in a large pneumothorax, in which pleural air exerts positive pressure on mediastinal and intrathoracic structures, i.e. results in ipsilateral lung collapse and mediastinal shift, and compressed great veins
- Radiographs
    - Two projections - depends on which surface X ray hits first
        - Posterior-anterior projection (standard)
