### Definition of Prevention

Prevention is defined as the actions that prevent disease occurrence, slows disease progression, or minimise the impact of disease.

- **This definition of prevention implies there are different levels of prevention**
    1. Primary prevention - Prevention that aims to prevent diseases from occurring (i.e. preventing disease occurrence), often targeting risk factors at an individual or population levels ([[Population approach of prevention beats individual approach of prevention\|Population approach of prevention beats individual approach of prevention]]).
    2. Secondary prevention - Prevention that aims to improve survival by delaying onset and reducing duration of clinical disease. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Screening\|Screening]] is the key example of secondary prevention.
    3. Tertiary prevention - Prevention that aims to improve survival by slowing disease prevention and reducing disease sequalae.
    
    Prevention operates at different points of time during the timeline of disease.
    
    There are also other aspects of prevention:
    
    - Primordial prevention - Prevention that targets upstream [[determinants of health\|determinants of health]], namely the social, economic, environmental, political determinants of health. It requires changes in public policies and intersectoral actions.
    - Quaternary prevention - Prevention that aims to reduce iatrogenesis, to identify individuals or groups at risk of over-treatment and over-diagnosis.

Prevention can be carried out with different approaches, but [[Population approach of prevention beats individual approach of prevention\|Population approach of prevention beats individual approach of prevention]].
