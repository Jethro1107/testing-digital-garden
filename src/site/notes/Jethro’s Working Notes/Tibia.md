### Tibia

The tibia is part of the bony framework of the leg. It occupies the medial position, with respect to the smaller [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Fibula\|Fibula]].

- **Proximal end of the Tibia**
    
    The proximal end of the fibula is separated into the lateral condyle and the medial condyle, and the intercondylar eminence.
    
    Inferior to the condyles and on the anterior surface of the shaft, the tibial tuberosity is present, which serves as the insertion of the Quadriceps femoris muscle.

- **Shaft of the Tibia**
    
    On the posterior surface of the shaft, is a ridge called the soleal line. It runs laterally to medially and separates the [[soleus\|soleus]] muscle.
    
- **Distal end of the Tibia**
    
    The distal end of the fibula, on the medial side forms a projection that extends distally called the medial malleolus (forming the medial end of the ankle). The medial malleolus articulates the the tallus, the medial large tarsal bone, which forms a major part of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ankle joint\|Ankle joint]].
