### Tibia
The tibia is part of the bony framework of the leg. It occupies the medial position, with respect to the smaller [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Fibula\|Fibula]].
- **Proximal end of the Tibia**
	- The proximal end of the fibula is separated into the lateral condyle and the medial condyle, and the intercondylar eminence.
	- Inferior to the condyles and on the anterior surface of the shaft, the tibial tuberosity is present, which serves as the insertion of the Quadriceps femoris muscle.
- **Shaft of the Tibia**
    On the posterior surface of the shaft, is a ridge called the soleal line. It runs laterally to medially and separates the [[soleus\|soleus]] muscle.
- **Distal end of the Tibia**
    The distal end of the fibula, on the medial side forms a projection that extends distally called the medial malleolus (forming the medial end of the ankle). The medial malleolus articulates the the tallus, the medial large tarsal bone, which forms a major part of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ankle joint\|Ankle joint]].
