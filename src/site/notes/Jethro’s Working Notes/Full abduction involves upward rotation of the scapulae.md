### Full abduction involves upward rotation of the scapulae.

One might assume that the glenohumeral joint is fully responsible for abduction of the arm, however, this is not the case.

At 150 degrees, the greater tubercle of the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Humerus\|Humerus]] comes in contact with the glenoid labrum of the scapulae, which prevents further abduction at the [[Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)\|Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)]]]].

Abduction beyond 150 degrees, requires upward rotation of the scapulae, which causes the glenoid fossa to tilt up, lifting the humerus, as if fully abducting the arm. Hence, [[Full abduction of the arm requires action of 4 muscles\|Full abduction of the arm requires action of 4 muscles]].
