### Innervation of the oesophagus

Only the distal 2/3 of the oesophagus consist of smooth muscles ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Histology of the oesophagus\|Histology of the oesophagus]]), hence, only the thoracic and abdominal part of the oesophagus are under the control of the autonomic nervous system.

- **The oesophagus is innervated by the:**
    
    Oesophageal plexus, a bundle of nerves on the surface of the oesophagus, contributed by the left vagus nerve (which combines to give the anterior vagal branch), the right vagus nerve (which combines to give the posterior vagal branch) and the fibres arising from the sympathetic trunk (T2-T6)
    
    - Sympathetic innervation is provided by sympathetic nerve fibres arising from T2-T6.
    - Parasympathetic innervation is provided by vagus nerve.
