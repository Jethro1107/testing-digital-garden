### Organization of Body Functions

- Describe the hierarchical orgaanization of body functions.
    
    Cells ⇒ Tissues ⇒ Organs ⇒ Systems ⇒ Human body
    
- Explain the dynamic nature of cellular function.
    
    All cells are dynamic in terms of quality, spatial, temporal and quantity factors
    
    Quality: Different cells produce different proteins
    
    Spatial: Proteins are synthesized and used in different compartments of cells to meet its function
    
    Temporal: Cells make proteins at the right time to serve its function
    
    Quality: Different cells make the same protein at different amounts
    
    To function optimally, a cell has to make the right protein at the right location, at the right time and by the right amounts
    
- Describe the interactive organization of body functions.
    
    All systems interact with each other dynamically instead of working in isolation
    
    3 systems play regulatory roles - Nervous, Endocrine and Immune
    
    Others work together to bring out different functions - CVS, Respiratory, GI, Musculoskeletal, Urogenital, Reproductive
    

### Homeostasis

- Define homeostasis.
    
    Homeostasis - The maintenance of a relatively constant condition of the internal environment (extracellular fluid)
    
    All cells contribute to the maintenance of homeostatic condition of the extracellular fluid (intravascular fluid, interstitial fluid)
    
- How are signalling processes that play a role in homeostasis maintenance classified?
    
    Electrical signalling to stimulate excitable cells
    
    Chemical signalling to stimulate non-excitable cells
    
    Chemical signalling can be further classified into:
    
    Autocrine signalling - Cell releases a chemical that acts upon itself, regulating its own function
    
    Paracrine signalling - Cell releases a chemical that acts on neighboring cells
    
    Endocrine signalling - Cell releases a chemical into blood, and acts on cell at a different site
    
- List certain facts about body fluid and electrolytes.
    
    Body fluid constitutes 60% of total body weight
    
    Body fluid - 2/3 intracellular fluid; 1/3 extracellular fluid
    
    Extracellular fluid - 1/4 intravascular fluid (plasma); 3/4 interstitial fluid
    
    Predominant cation in interstitial fluid is Na
    
    90% of K is intracellular
    
    The interstitial fluid has very low concentration of proteins
    
    Plasma contains albumin and other proteins
    

### Negative Feedback Control of Physiological Functions

- Describe the principle of negative feedback control of physiological functions.
    
    Deviation from a given normal set-point is detected by a sensor, sending a signal to the controller
    
    If the parameter deviates from the set-point, it sends a signal to effector to trigger compensatory changes until the parameter returns to set point
    
- How is efficiency of negative feedback calculated?
    
    Efficiency = Correction/Error
    
    usually <1
    
- Describe the negative feedback control of blood calcium level.
    
    When blood calcium levels decrease, Parathyroid hormones (PTH) is secreted
    
    PTH stimulates Ca reabsorption in the kidney, bone resorption, and synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxy-D3 to promote Ca absorption in gut
    
    Blood calcium level increases and returns to set point
    

### Positive Feedback Control of Physiological Functions

- Describe the principle of positive feedback control of physiological function.
    
    Deviation from a given normal set-point will trigger changes that will cause further deviation from the set-point
    
    A positive feedback loop will not contribute to homeostasis, but it is essential to our physiological functions
    
- Describe the positive feedback control in childbirth and it's significance.
    
    Uterine contraction pushes baby downwards, stretching and stimulating the cervix
    
    Cervix sends nerve impulse to posterior pituitary gland, which releases oxytocin to increase the force and frequency of contraction
    
    This positive feedback loop amplifies the force and frequency of contractions, thus speeding up childbirth to prevent hypoxic damage to baby
    
- Describe the positive feedback control in blood clotting.
    
    Extrinsic pathway stimulates thrombin formation
    
    Thrombin produced positively feedbacks to the intrinsic pathway to produce more thrombin
    
- Describe the positive feedback control in generation of nerve signal.
    
    Depolarization of nerve cell causes the opening of voltage-gated ion channels, which results in the influx of sodium ions, further depolarizes the membrane, triggering action potential generation
