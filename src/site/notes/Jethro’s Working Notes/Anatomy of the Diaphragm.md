## Anatomy of the Diaphragm

- What are the different structures of the diaphragm?
    1. Muscular part
    2. Central tendon
    3. Posterior ligaments - Provide posterior attachment and support for diaphragm:
        - Lateral arcuate ligament
        - Medial arcuate ligament
        - Median arcuate ligament
    4. Openings
- Diaphragmatic openings and the structures that pass through them
    
    **Caval opening (T8)** - Inferior Vena Cava, Phrenic nerve
    
    **Oesophageal hiatus (T10)** - Oesophagus, vagus nerve, branches of gastric vessels, lymphatics
    
    **Aortic hiatus (T12)** - Aorta, azygous vein, thoracic duct
    
- What is the blood supply of the diaphragm?
    
    Supplied by the musculophrenic arteries (branch of ITA) and veins
    
    Supplied by inferior phrenic arteries (branch of abdominal aorta) and veins
    
- What is the nerve supply of the diaphragm?
    
    Phrenic nerves (derived from C3-C5)
