### Interossei muscles

The interossei muscles work to abduct and adduct the 2nd to 5th digits at the metacarophalangeal joints.

They also play a role in the extension of the interphalangeal joints due to its insertion to the dorsal extensor expansion.

They lie deep to the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Lumbricals\|Lumbricals]].

For classification purposes, it is classified into ********************dorsal interssei (4)******************** and  ***********************palmar interossei (3).***********************

### Dorsal interossei

The dorsal interossei are the most dorsally situated intrinsic muscles of the hands and can be palpated between the metacarpals when the fingers are fully extended.

There are 4 dorsal interossei muscles, which originate from the metacarpals and insert at 1) ******the dorsal extension expansion****** and 2) **********************************************************at the base of the proximal phalanx, in a way that when they contract, abduction of the digits occur**********************************************************.

    It enables the abduction of the digits.
    
    It enables extension of the digits at the interphalangeal joints (due to its association with the extensor expansion).
    
    It enables medial and lateral abduction of the middle finger.
    

### Palmar interossei

Palmar interossei is deep to the lumbricals.

There are 3 palmar interosseus muscles, which originate from the metacarpals and insert onto the base of the proximal phalanx and onto the dorsal extensor expansion.

    It enables adduction of the digits.
    
    It enables extension of the digits at the interphalangeal joints due to its association with the extensor expansion.
