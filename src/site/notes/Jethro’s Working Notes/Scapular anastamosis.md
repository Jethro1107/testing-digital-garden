### Scapular anastamosis

The scapular anastamosis is an arterial anastamosis between branches of the subclavian artery, the suprascapular artery and dorsal scapular artery, with the branches of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axillary artery\|Axillary artery]], the circumflex subscapular artery.

- The suprascapular artery is a branch of the 1st part of subclavian artery that passes over the superior transverse scapular ligament and gives branches in the supraspinous fossa  and infraspinous fossa.
- The dorsal scapular artery is a branch of the 1st part of the subclavian artery that descends along the medial border of the scapulae (along with the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Dorsal scapular nerve\|Dorsal scapular nerve]].
