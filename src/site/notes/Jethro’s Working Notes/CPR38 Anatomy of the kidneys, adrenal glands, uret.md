### Anatomy of the kidneys, ureters and suprarenal glands

- Anatomy of the kidneys
    - **Location of the kidneys**
        
        Kidneys are located in the retroperitoneum, posterior of the parietal peritoneum on the posterior abdominal wall, extending from T12 to L3 inferiorly
        
        Right kidney is lower than left kidney due to the association with the liver

    - **Enclosure of the kidneys**
        
        The kidney is enclosed in a renal fibrous capsule, where immediately outside, it is enclosed in a unique arrangement of fat and fascia
        
        Immediate outside the renal capsule, the kidney is enclosed in the perirenal fat
        
        Enclosing the perirenal fat is a membranous condensation of extraperitoneal fascia, the renal fascia
        
        Enclosing the laterally and posterior surface of the renal fascia is another layer of fat, the pararenal fat

    - **Anatomical structures/Gross anatomy of the kidneys**
        
        Kidney (a bean shaped organ with a hollow renal sinus medially) consist of an outer cortex and an inner medulla
        
        Renal cortex - consist of renal corpusules of the nephron
        
        Renal medulla - consist of renal tubules
        
        Extensions of renal cortex into inner aspect of kidney, the renal columns separates the medulla into renal pyramids
        
        Each renal pyramid and its cortical tissue at its base and sides (renal columns) constitute a renal lobe
        
        The apical tip of renal pyramids, the renal papilla consist of openings of collecting ducts that drain into the minor calyx
        
        In the renal sinus, several minor calices unite to form a major calyx, where 2 or 3 major calices unite to form the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped superior end of ureter, connecting with ureter at ureteropelvic junction

    - **Blood supply of the kidneys**
        
        Supplied by renal arteries and renal veins
        
        Renal arteries - direct lateral branch of the abdominal aorta, just below superior mesenteric artery
        
        Renal veins - left renal vein is longer than right renal vein as it has to cross the midline between the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery to reach the inferior vena cava

        Sympathetic fibres arising from T12
        
        Vagus nerve providing parasympathetic innervations
        
    - **Lymphatics of the kidney**
        
        Lymphatic drainage of each kidney drains into the lateral aortic/lumbar lymph nodes around the origin of renal arteries
        
- Anatomy of the suprarenal glands

        Located on superior pole of kidneys
        
        Consist of the outer cortex and inner medulla
        
        Ref: [[Gray’s Anatomy  Location of suprarenal gland\|Gray’s Anatomy  Location of suprarenal gland]] 
        
    - **Blood supply of the suprarenal glands**
        
        3 arterial supply:
        
        Superior suprarenal arteries given off as a branch of inferior phrenic artery (a branch of abdominal aorta)
        
        Middle suprarenal arteries given off as a branch of abdominal aorta
        
        Inferior suprarenal arteries given off as a branch of renal arteries

    - **Nerve supply of the suprarenal glands**
        
        Innervated by greater splanchnic nerve consisting of preganglionic sympathetic fibers arising from T5-T9 that synapse with cells in the adrenal medulla
        
- Anatomy of the ureters
    - **Three physiological narrowings of the ureters**
        
        The ureter constricts in 3 places:
        
        1. Junction between renal pelvis and ureters (ureterpelvic junction)
        2. Pelvic inlet
        3. Entrance to urinary bladder
        
        Kidney stones are usually lodged in these constrictions
        
    - **Blood supply of the ureters**
        
        Upper part of ureters is supplied by renal arteries and veins
        
        Middle part of ureters is supplied by gonadal arteries and veins (Testiular or ovarian arteries and veins), branches of abdominal aorta and common iliac artery
        
        Lower part of ureters is supplied by internal iliac arteries and veins, and vesical arteries and veins

### Anatomy of the pelvis

- Anatomy of pelvic inlet
    - **Margin of pelvic inlet**
        
        Posteriorly, pelvic inlet is bordered by the body of the S1 bone, which projects into the inlet to form the sacral **promontory**, and the transverse processes of the sacral bone, the **ala (wing) of sacrum**
        
        Laterally, pelvic inlet is bordered by the left and right linea terminalis, a line involving the pelvic girdle:
        
        Arcuate line - inner surface of ilum
        
        Pectineal line - superior ramus of pubic bone
        
        Pubic crest - joins the two public bones

            Obturator internus muscle - originates from internal surface of pelvis and inserts onto the medial side of femur
            
            They both work to laterally rotate the hip and adducts thigh to hip joint

- Blood supply of pelvis
    - **Major arteries supplying pelvis**
        
        Internal iliac arteries, which branch into the anterior and posterior division
        
    - **Posterior division branches of pelvic blood supply**
        
        Posterior trunk of internal iliac artery gives off 3 branches:
        
        1. **iliolumbar artery** - ascends laterally through the pelvic inlet and divides into the iliac branch and lumbar branch
        2. **Lateral sarcal arteries** (two branch) - courses medially and inferiorly to supply the sarcrum and structures behind it (muscles and skin)
        3. **Superior gluteal artery** - largest branch and the continuation of the internal iliac artery, leaves the pelvic cavity via greater sciatic foramen superior to the piriformis muscle to the gluteal region of the lower limbs
    - **Anterior division branches of pelvic blood supply**
        
        Anterior trunk of internal iliac artery gives off 9 branches:
        
        1. Umbilical artery - Close off after birth to the origin of superior vesical artery to form the medial umbilical ligament
        2. Superior vesical artery - arise from umbilical artery to supply superior parts of bladder and distal ends of ureters, where in men, also gives off arteries to supply ductus deferens
        3. Inferior vesical artery - occurs in men, supplying bladder, distal parts of ureters, seminal vesicles and prostate, the equivalent in women is the vaginal artery, supplying the vagina, the bladder and the rectum
        4. Middle rectus artery - supplies the rectum
        5. Obturator artery - leaves pelvic cavity via Obturator canal with VAN to supply adductor muscles of the thign
        6. Inferior pudendal artery - leaves pelvic cavity via greater sciatic foramen inferior to piriformis muscle and enters perineum via the lesser sciatic foramen, supplying erectile tissues in the penis and clitoris
        7. Inferior gluteal artery - leaves pelvic cavity via greater sciatic foramen inferior to piriformis muscle and enters gluteal region
        8. Vaginal artery
        9. Uterine artery - supplies uterus

- **Anatomical relations of urinary bladder**
    
    Anterior - Pubic symphysis
    
    Posterior - Rectum, ductus deferens (male), seminal vesicles (male), uterus (female)
    
    Inferior - prostate, which is situated on top of urogenital diaphragm/deep transverse perineal muscle
    
- **Anatomical structure of the bladder**
    
    The urinary bladder is shaped like a triangular pyramid, an apex, a base, a superior surface, and 2 inferolateral surface
    
    Detrussor muscle is the muscular layer of the urinary bladder, where the inner surface is lined with transitional epithelium, and externally lined with serous peritoneum on the superior surface
    
    The detrussor muscle forms sphincter vesicae inferiorly

    The ureter inserts inferolaterally into the bladder at the ureteric oriface, where the ureter communicates with the bladder
    
    The two ureteric oriface are connected by the ureteric ridge on the base of the bladder
    
    The trigone is a triangular area at the base of the bladder, between the 2 ureteric oriface and the urethral oriface. It is smooth in lining an sensitive to pain
