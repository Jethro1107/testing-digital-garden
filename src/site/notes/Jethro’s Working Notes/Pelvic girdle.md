### Pelvic girdle

The pelvic girdle forms the bony framework of the gluteal region of the lower limb ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the lower limb\|Anatomy of the lower limb]]), and is part of the bony pelvis. It consist of 3 bones that fuse during puberty, the *ileum, ischium and the pubis*, which fuse at the acetabulum*.*

- **The ileum forms the superior part of the pelvic girdle**
    
    The inner surface (iliac fossa) of the ileum faces the abdomen, whereas the outer surface of the ileum faces the gluteal region.
    
    The ileum is a flat, fan-shaped bone which has a border superiorly that extends from the *posterior superior iliac spine* to the *anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)*.
    
    - The posterior superior iliac spine gives rise to the dimples of venus at the back, as it has a short ligament attached to the posterior abdominal wall, resulting in the depression.
    - The anterior superior iliac spine is palpable. It serves as one of the attachments of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Inguinal ligament\|Inguinal ligament]].
    - Just posterior to the anterior superior iliac spine, laterally, the iliac crest forms a protrusion called the iliac tubercle.
    
    Just below the anterior superior iliac spine, is the anterior inferior iliac spine, which is superior to the acetabulum.
    
    The inner surface of the ilium is the iliac fossa.
    
    The medial border of the iliac fossa forms the arcuate line, which forms the margins of the pelvic inlet.
    
- **The ischium forms the inferoposterior part of the pelvic girdle**
    
    The ischium has two major features, the ischial spine posteriorly, and the ischial tuberosity laterally.
    
    - The ischial spine gives rise to the greater sciatic notch and the lesser sciatic notch.
- **The pubis forms the inferoanterior part of the pelvic girdle**
    
    The pubis consist of 3 parts, the body, the superior pubic ramus and the inferior pubic ramus.
    
    The body is flat dorsal laterally, where the body of the pubis of the two pelvic girdle join at the pubic symphysis. It has a rounded pubic crest which ends laterally as the prominent pubic tubercle.
    
    The superior pubic ramus projects posterosuperiorly, and joins the ilium and ischium at the acetabulum. The superior margins of the superior pubic ramus forms the pectineal line, which forms part of the linea terminalis and the pelvic inlet. The inferior aspect of the superior pubic ramus is marked by the obturator crest.
    
    The inferior pubic ramus projects posteroinferiorly and joins the ischial ramus.

The pubis and the ischium forms the obturator foramen.

- **The 3 bones of the pelvic girdle fuse at the acetabulum**
    
    The acetabulum serves as the socket for the attachment of the feumur head at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hip joint\|Hip joint]].
    
    The margins of the acetabulum is marked by the inferior acetabular notch.
    
    At the centre of the acetabulum is the acetabular fossa, a shallow circular region that forms the non-articular surface of the acetebulum. *The acetabular fossa is continuous with the acetabular notch.*
    
    At the horseshoe shaped structure surrounding the acetabular fossa, the lunate surface, is lined with cartilage and forms the articular surface.
