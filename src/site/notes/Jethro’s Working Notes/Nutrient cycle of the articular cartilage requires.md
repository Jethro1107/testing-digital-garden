### Nutrient cycle of the articular cartilage requires mechanical loading at the joint

The articular cartilage is an avascular tissue, and depends on mechanical loading for nutrition.

During physiological loading, synovial fluid containing nutrients is pushed into chondrocytes, enabling chondrocytes to acquire nutrients. This is significant for synthesis of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cartilage matrix\|Cartilage matrix]] for maintenance of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/ECM homeostasis\|ECM homeostasis]].

During unloading, the metabolites diffuse back out to the synovial fluid.
