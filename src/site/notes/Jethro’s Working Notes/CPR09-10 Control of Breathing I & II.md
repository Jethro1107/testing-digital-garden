### Neural Control of Breathing

- **Property of breathing patterns in neural control of breathing**
    - Regular and rhythmic
- Basic elements of neural control of breathing
    - **Components of neural control of quiet breathing**
        - The three basic elements of neural control of breathing are sensors, central control in the brain, and effectors
        - 'Sensors' gather information and feed them into the central controllers in the brain, which integrates the information and send impulses to effectors which cause respiration
        - The sensors involved are the pulmonary stretch receptors, the central controller involved include the respiratory center in the medulla and the pons, and the effectors involved are the respiratory muscles
    - **Central Controller of the brain**
        - Medullary respiratory center
            - **Anatomical division of medullary respiratory center**
                - The two anatomical components of the medullary respiratory center includes the dorsal respiratory group and the ventral respiratory group
                - **Dorsal respiratory group:**
                - Consist of inspiratory neurons that feed into spinal motor neurons that activate the inspiratory muscles. i.e. external intercostals and diaphragm
                - Inspiratory neurons of DRG also feed into inspiratory neurons in the VRG
                - **Ventral respiratory group:**
                - Inspiratory neurons of VRG receives input from inspiratory neurons in DRG and Pre-Botzinger Complex, and feeds into spinal motor neurons to activate the inspiratory muscles
                - Expiratory neurons in the VRG is usually quiescent in normal breathing, but is active in forced ventilation
                - The inspiratory neurons and expiratory neurons of the VRG show reciprocal inhibition
                - Consist of the Pre-Botzinger Complex, which sets the basal respiratory rate and inputs into the inspiratory neurons of the VRG
            - **Physiological division of medullary respiratory center**
                - Physiologically, the medulla respiratory center can hence be divided into the inspiratory center and the expiratory center
                    - Inspiratory center (inspiratory neurons from DRG and VRG) - Motor center for inspiration
                    - Expiratory center (expiratory neurons from VRG) - Motor center for expiration
                    - The inspiratory center and expiratory center have reciprocal inhibition as shown in the VRG
        - Pons
            - **Division of the respiratory center in the pons**
                - Apneustic center (middle and lower pons) - Inhibits the transition from inspiration to expiration by prolonging inspiration by stimulating the inspiratory center
                - Pneumotaxic center (upper pons) - Stimulates the transition from the inspiration to expiration by inhibiting the apneustic center, and thus the inspiratory center

- Neural pathways in quiet breathing pattern
    - Neural pathways in inspiration
        - Pre-Botzinger complex in the VRG stimulates the inspiratory center which stimulates the contraction of inspiratory muscles, initiating inspiration
        - Stimulation of inspiratory center is also facilitated by the apneustic center
        - Stimulation of inspiratory center causes the inhibition of the expiratory center
    - Neural pathways in transition from inspiration to expiration
        - Vagal feedback:
            - After inspiration, lung stretch receptors are stimulated, and stimulates the expiratory center, which inhibits the inspiratory center
            - Lung stretch receptors also inhibit the apneustic center, which inhibits the inspiratory center (Hering-Breuer Reflex)
        - Pneumotaxic feedback:
            - The stimulated inspiratory center stimulates the pneumotaxic center, which inhibits the apneustic center, inhibiting the stimulation on inspiratory center
        - Inhibition of inspiratory center allows inspiratory muscles to relax, and the deflation of the lungs by its elastic recoil
    - Neural pathways in transition from expiration to inspiration
        - After expiration, the lung recoils to its original position and the lung stretch receptors are stimulated, stimulating the inspiratory center via the vagal nerve
        - The lung stretch receptors also stimulate the apneustic center, which stimulates the inspiratory center (Hering-Breur Reflex)
        - Stimulated inspiratory center stimulates the contraction of inspiratory muscles, i.e. initiating inspiration

### Chemical Control of Breathing

- Effects of CO2
    - **Ventilation-Alveolar PCO2 relationship (Explanation of shape of ventilation-PCO2 curve)**
        - At low PCO2 (<40 mmHg), ventilation is indepedent of PCO2, as ventilation is controlled by wakefulness drive
        - At moderate PCO2 (40 to 60 mmHg), ventilation has a high response coefficient to changes in PCO2, allowed for minute to minute metabolic control of ventilation
        - At high PCO2 (> 60 mmHg), ventilation has a low response coefficient to changes in PCO2, as high PCO2 results in acidosis, which depress neural activity

    - Ventilatory response to acute CO2 inhalation
        - **Physiological mechanisms of ventilatory response to acute CO2 inhalation**
            - In blood, acute CO2 inhalation causes an increase in arterial PCO2, and hence a increase in H+ concentration, stimulating peripheral receptors, thus increasing Ventilation within a second
            - Increase in arterial PCO2 causes an increase in PCO2 in CSF, and hence an increase in H+ concentration in CSF, stimulating central receptors, thus increasing Ventilation with latency of 20-30 seconds, and a steady response in 5-10 minutes
        - **Response time of peripheral chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors to acute CO2 inhalation**
            - Peripheral chemoreceptors respond within a second, as acidosis occurs almost immediately after acute CO2 inhalation
            - Central chemoreceptors have a latency of 20-30 seconds, as it takes time for CO2 to reach the brain and CSF after acute CO2 inhalation
        - **Relative response of peripheral chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors to acute CO2 inhalation**
            - Response of peripheral chemoreceptors accounts of 20-30% of total ventilatory response, as protein buffers are present to buffer pH in blood
            - Response of peripheral chemoreceptors account for 70-80% of total ventilatory response, as protein buffers are absent to buffer pH in CSF
    - Ventilatory response to prolonged CO2 inhalation and retention (Acclimatization of high PCO2)
        - **Compensatory mechanisms to prolonged CO2 inhalation and retention and its effects on Ventilation**
            - High PCO2 causes acidosis, which is restored via several mechanisms:
            - Via secretion of HCO3- by choroid plexus and brain cells, cause an increase in CSF [HCO3-], increasing pH according to Henderson-Hasselbach Equation, thus resulting in gradual decline in ventilation via central chemoreceptor stimulation
            - Via renal renal reabsorption of HCO3-, cause an increase in blood [HCO3-], increasing pH according to Henderson-Hasselbach Equation, thus resulting in a gradual decline in ventilation via peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation
        - Acclimatization to high PCO2
            - **Why do patients with high CO2 retention have low ventilatory response to increase in PCO2?**
                - Patients tend to have high [HCO3-] by compensatory mechanisms, which makes at any PCO2 to have a lower stimulatory pH on the chemoreceptors, as a result decreasing the potency of CO2 as a ventilatory stimulus
                - Hence, COPD patients tend to rely on their hypoxic respiratory drive more
- Effects of O2
    - **Ventilation-Alveolar PO2 relationship (Explain the shape of the ventilation-PO2 Curve)**
        - Decrease in alveolar PO2 does not reliably stimulate ventilation until alveolar PO2 falls below 60 mmHg:
            - Beyond PO2 of (>60mmHg), Ventilation has a low response coefficient. This is due to the sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve (at 60mmHg, SpO2 remains high at 90%).
            - At low PO2 (<60 mmHg), Ventilation has a high response coefficient. However, this ventilatory response is halted due to the braking effects of accompanying hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis.
            - Hence physiological control of PO2 on Ventilation is insignificant.

    - **Ventilatory response to acute hypoxia**
        - In blood, acute hypoxia causes a decrease in arterial PO2, stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors, thus increasing ventilation
        - Increased ventilation causes hypocapnia and alkalosis (decrease in PCO2 and H+), attributing to the braking effects of peripheral chemoreceptor, thus decreasing Ventilation
        - Hypocapnia, causes a decrease in PCO2 in CSF, and decrease in H+ concentration in CSF, attributing to the braking effects of central chemoreceptors, thus decreasing Ventilation
        - As a result, acute hypoxia only results in a small increase in Ventilation
    - Ventilatory response to prolonged hypoxia (Acclimatization of low PO2)
        - **Compensatory mechanisms in prolonged hypoxia and its effects on Ventilation**
            - Low PO2 causes respiratory alkalosis, which is restored by several mechanism:
            - Via transport of HCO3- out of CSF, causing a decrease in [HCO3-] in CSF, decreasing pH according to Henderson-Hasselbach Equation, thus increasing Ventilation via central chemoreceptor stimulation
            - Via renal excretion of HCO3-, causing a decrease in [HCO3-] in blood, decreasing pH according to Henderson-Hasselbach Equation, thus increasing Ventilation via stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptor
        - Acclimatization to low PO2
            - **Why do patients with low PO2 have high ventilatory response to decrease in PO2?**
                - Patients tend to have low [HCO3-] by compensatory mechanisms, which makes at any PCO2 to have a higher stimulatory pH on the chemoreceptors, as a result making PO2 an important ventilatory stimulus
- Effects of pH
    - **Ventilation-pH relationship (Explain the shape of the ventilation-pH curve)**
        - Decrease in arterial pH stimulates ventilation
    - Respiratory acidosis
        - **Definition of respiratory acidosis**
            - Respiratory acidosis refers to acidosis caused by excessive retention of carbon dioxide (increase in PCO2)
        - **Physiological mechanisms of ventilatory response to respiratory acidosis**
            - In respiratory acidosis, arterial PCO2 increases, causing a decrease in pH, stimulating Ventilation via peripheral receptors within seconds (20-30% of total ventilatory response)
            - Increase in arterial PCO2 causes an increase in PCO2 in CSF, which decreases pH in CSF, stimulating Ventilation via central receptors with a latency of 20-30 seconds (70-80% of total ventilatory response)
    - Metabolic acidosis
        - **Definition of metabolic acidosis**
            - Metabolic acidosis refers to acidosis due to causes other than increase in PCO2
        - **Physiological mechanisms of ventilatory response to metabolic acidosis**
            - In metabolic acidosis, there is an increase in production of a non-CO2 acid, causing a decrease in pH, stimulating Ventilation via peripheral receptors
            - This causes a decrease in PCO2 and hence an increase in pH, attributing to the braking effect on peripheral chemoreceptor, resulting in decrease in Ventilation
            - The decrease in PCO2 in blood results in a decrease in PCO2 and hence an increase in pH in CSF, attributing to the braking effect on central chemoreceptor, resulting in decrease in Ventilation
            - Hence, metabolic acidosis only results in a small increase in Ventilation
            - Note that the metabolic acid does not stimulate central receptors as the BBB is impermeable to H+
