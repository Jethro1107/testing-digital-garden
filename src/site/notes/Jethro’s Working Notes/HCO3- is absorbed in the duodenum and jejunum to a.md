### HCO3- is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum to avoid metabolic acidosis

Large amounts of HCO3- is secreted into the duodenum, via pancreatic secretions and biliary secretions (a la [[Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids\|Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids]], [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Bile is secreted in two phases in the liver\|Bile is secreted in two phases in the liver]]). Hence, often large quantities of HCO3- must be reabsorbed in the duodenum and jejunum to avoid metabolic acidosis.

- **HCO3- is largely reabsorbed in an indirect way:**
    
    NHE pumps out H+ and pumps in Na+ down the Na+ gradient generated by basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase.
    
    H+ combines with luminal HCO3- to give H2CO3, which is converted into CO2 and H2O by carbonic anhydrase.
    
    H2O remains within the intestinal lumen as part of the chyme, but CO2 is readily absorbed into blood and eventually exhaled in the lungs.
    
    This mechanism of HCO3- is largely similar to the renal mechanism of HCO3- reabsorption.
