### Anatomy of the upper limb

The upper limb, also known as the upper extremity, is part of the appendicular skeleton that extends from shoulder to the tip of our fingers. It is a body region that is lateral to the inferior aspect of the neck and the thorax.

[[Jethro’s Working Notes/Regions of the upper limb\|Regions of the upper limb]]  is based on the joints and component bones, and is roughly divided into the shoulder, arm (brachium), forearm (Antebrachium) and hand. The cubital fossa is a depressed region in the transition between the arm and forearm.

### Bones and joints of the upper limb

As mentioned, the upper limb can be classified into the shoulder, arm, forearm and hand, which is based on the joints and component bones.

The bony framework of the shoulder is made of:

- the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pectoral girdle\|Pectoral girdle]], which consist of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clavicle\|Clavicle]] and the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Scapulae\|Scapulae]]
- the proximal end of the humerus

Important joints of the shoulder include:

- The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Sternoclavicular joint\|Sternoclavicular joint]], the only joint that joins the pelvic girdle to the axial skeleton
- The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Acromioclavicular joint\|Acromioclavicular joint]]
- The [[Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)\|Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)]]]]

The bony framework of the arm is made of:

- The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Humerus\|Humerus]]

Important joints of the arm include:

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Elbow joint\|Elbow joint]], which consist of 3 articulations enclosed within the same synovial cavity

The bondy framework of the forearm is made of:

- the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Radius\|Radius]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ulna\|Ulna]]

Important joints of the forearm include:

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Proximal and distal radioulnar joint\|Proximal and distal radioulnar joint]]s
- [[Wrist joint (radiocarpal [[joint)\|Wrist joint (radiocarpal [[joint)]]]]

Note the bony framework of the hands ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bones of the hand and the arches of the hand\|Bones of the hand and the arches of the hand]]), and its important joints ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Joints of the hand\|Joints of the hand]]). Particularly, the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Carpometalcarpal joint of the thumb\|Carpometalcarpal joint of the thumb]] works independently from the carpometacarpal joint of the rest of the digits.

### Muscles of the upper limb

Muscles that move the pectoral girdle - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Trapezius\|Trapezius]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Levator scapulae\|Levator scapulae]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rhomboid major and minor\|Rhomboid major and minor]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Serratus anterior\|Serratus anterior]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pectoralis minor\|Pectoralis minor]]. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Subclavius\|Subclavius]]

Muscles that move the arm/shoulder joint - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Deltoid\|Deltoid]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Latissimus dorsi\|Latissimus dorsi]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pectoralis major\|Pectoralis major]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rotary cuff muscles\|Rotary cuff muscles]]. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Teres major\|Teres major]]. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Coracobrachialis\|Coracobrachialis]]

Muscles of the arm/ that move the elbow joint:

- The arm is separated into the two compartments, the anterior compartment (which consist of anterior flexor group), and the posterior compartment (which consist of the posterior extensor group). The two compartments are separated by the medial and lateral itermuscular septum.
- Anterior flexor group - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Coracobrachialis\|Coracobrachialis]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biceps brachii\|Biceps brachii]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachialis\|Brachialis]]
- Posterior extensor group - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Triceps brachii\|Triceps brachii]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anconeus\|Anconeus]]

Muscles of the forearm:

- The forearm is classified into the anterior compartment of the forearm, and posterior compartment of the forearm. The two compartments are separated by the interosseous membrane and fascia of the muscles and associated intermuscular septum. Note that the posterior group seeps into the anterior group on the lateral side, due to the brachioradialis.
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterior compartment of the forearm\|Anterior compartment of the forearm]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior compartment of the forearm\|Posterior compartment of the forearm]]

Muscles of the hand:

- The intrinsic muscles of the hands can be largely classified into 5 groups:
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Thenar muscles\|Thenar muscles]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Adductor pollicus\|Adductor pollicus]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hypothenar muscles\|Hypothenar muscles]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Lumbricals\|Lumbricals]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Interossei muscles\|Interossei muscles]]

### Innervation of the upper limb

The upper limb is innervated by the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial plexus\|Brachial plexus]]

### Vascular supply of the upper limb

******************************************************************Arterial supply of the upper limb******************************************************************

Arterial supply of the upper limb starts with the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axillary artery\|Axillary artery]], which is the continuation of the subclavian artery once it enters the axillary inlet ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axilla\|Axilla]]), and terminates at the lower borders of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Teres major\|Teres major]].

The axillary artery then continues as the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial artery\|Brachial artery]], which branches into the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ulnar artery\|Ulnar artery]] and the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Radial artery\|Radial artery]].

********************************************************************************Deep veins of the upper limb follow the naming conventions of the arterial supply of the upper limb.********************************************************************************

[[Jethro’s Working Notes/Superficial veins of the upper limb\|Superficial veins of the upper limb]] 

### Regional anatomy

[[Jethro’s Working Notes/Regions of the upper limb\|Regions of the upper limb]] include the shoulder, the arm, the forearm and the hand.

The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cubital fossa\|Cubital fossa]] serves as a transition between the arm and the forearm.

The hand consist of 2 important spaces, the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Carpal tunnel\|Carpal tunnel]], and the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomical snuffbox\|Anatomical snuffbox]].
