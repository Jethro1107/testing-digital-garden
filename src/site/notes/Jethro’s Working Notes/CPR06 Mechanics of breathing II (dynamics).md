### Mechanics of Breathing: Dynamics

- How is airway resistance calculated?
    
    **Airway resistance** is the pressure difference between the alveoli and mouth divided by flow rate
    
- Describe and explain the distribution of airway resistance. What is the significance of it regarding detection airway disease.
    
    Distribution of airway resistance:
    
    - Upper airways (nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx) - 50% Raw
    - Medium sized airways (trachea, bronchi) - 40% Raw
    - Small airways (bronchioles) - <10% Raw
    
    **Small airways** contribute to very little of total airway resistance due to tremendous branching resulting in very high combined cross sectional area
    
    - Upper or medium sized airway diseases are easy to pick up as they result in significant change in airway resistance
    - Small airway diseases are more difficult to note as they cause an insignificant change in airway resistance

### Factors affecting Airway Resistance

- What are the five factors affecting airway resistance?
    1. Lung volume and radial traction
    2. Bronchomotor tone
    3. Lumen obstruction
    4. Air density and viscosity
    5. Transmural pressure across the airway wall
- What is radial traction? How does lung volume and radial traction affect airway resistance?
    
    **Radial traction is the retracting action of the surrounding alveoli on the wall of small airways**
    
    When **lung volume increase** during inspiration, the lung recoil pressure increase, causing an increase in radial traction on airway wall, causing cross sectional area of airway to increase, **decreasing airway resistance**
    
- How does radial traction and airway resistance change in diseased condition?
    
    Emphysema - Loss of lung elasticity
    
    A **loss of lung elasticity** results in a loss in lung recoil pressure, causing a decrease in radial traction on airway wall, causing cross sectional area of airway to decrease, and hence **airway resistance to increase**
    
    Pulmonary fibrosis - Deposition of scar tissue causing increase in lung elasticity
    
    **Increase in lung elasticity** results in an increase in lung recoil pressure, causing an increase in radial traction on airway wall, causing cross sectional area of airway to increase, and hence **airway resistance to decrease**
    
- How does bronchomotor tone affect airway resistance? How does bronchomotor tone change?
    
    **Increase in bronchomotor tone (constriction)** causes a decrease in cross sectional area of airway, resulting in an **increase in airway resistance**
    
    There are two factors affecting the bronchomotor tone - autonomic nerve activity and local effects:
    
    Increase in **parasympathetic activity (mediated by ACh)** causes increased bronchomotor tone, which increase airway resistance
    
    Increased **sympathetic activity (mediated by NA, a beta-2 agonist)** causes decreased bronchomotor tone, which decreases airway resistance
    
    **Decrease in local CO2 level** causes an increase in bronchomotor tone and increases airway resistance
    
    **Inflammatory mediators such as histamine** causes increased bronchomotor tone, which increase airway resistance
    
- How may lumen obstructions affect airway resistance?
    
    Lumen obstruction such as edema, mucus secretions and vascular congestion thickens the mucosal layer, causing an **increase in airway resistance**
    
- How does air density and viscosity affect airway resistance?
    
    Air resistance in laminar flow varies with viscosity
    
    Hence. **increase in viscosity** causes an increase in air resistance in **laminar flow**
    
    Air resistance in turbulent flow varies with density
    
    Hence, **increase in density** causes an increase in air resistance in **turbulent flow**
    
- How does transmural pressure across the wall of intrathoracic airway affect air resistance?
    
    Ptm across the intrathoracic airway refers to the pressure difference between airway and pleural cavity, i.e.:
    
    Ptm = Paw - Pip
    
    During inspiration, intrapleural pressure becomes more subatmospheric, causing transmural pressure to increase, causing increase in airway lumen size, and decrease in airway resistance
    
    During expiration, the intrapleural pressure is restored back to pre-inspiration value, causing transmural pressure to decrease, causing decrease in airway lumen size and increase in airway resistance
    
- How does asthma alter airway resistance?
    
    Basic defects of asthma is chronic inflammation of the airway, mucosal oedema, causing thickened mucosal layer and increased airway resistance
    
    In asthma attacks, there is constriction of smooth muscles, causing an increase in bronchomotor tone, and further increase in airway resistance
