### Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera

The abdominal viscera is supplied by the three anterior branches of the abdominal aorta (See [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Major branches of abdominal aorta\|Major branches of abdominal aorta]] for more details): 1) Celiac trunk, 2) Superior mesenteric artery and 3) Inferior mesentery artery.

- **The celiac trunk supplies:**
    
    Foregut derivatives - Distal end of oesophagus, stomach, proximal half of the descending part of the duodenum, liver
    
    The celiac trunk also branches into the splenic artery that supplies the spleen.

- **The inferior mesentery artery supplies:**
    
    Hindgut derivatives - The remaining parts of transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum.
