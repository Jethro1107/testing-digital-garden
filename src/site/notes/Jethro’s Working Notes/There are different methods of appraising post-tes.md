### There are different methods of appraising post-test probability after the application of diagnostic tests

Post-test probability is the ultimate factor for ruling in or ruling out a diagnosis after application of diagnostic tests.

- **************************Post-test probability can be estimated in 2 ways:**************************
    1. Predictive values
        
        Predictive value serves as a direct estimate of post-test probability.
        
    2. Odds-likelihood approach
        
        By multiplying [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Likelihood ratio\|Likelihood ratio]] (performance of a test) with pre-test odds (estimate by prevalence), we get post-test odds.
        
        Pre-test odds can be estimated as the prevalence.
        
        - Pre-test odds = Pre-test probability / (1 - Pre-test probability)
        - Post-test odds = Pre-test odds * Likelihood ratio
