### Gastric factors promote gastric emptying

Gastric factors (both nervous and hormonal) are known to initiate, and subsequently promote [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastric emptying\|Gastric emptying]].

- **************************************************************************************************************************************************Neural and hormonal gastric factors regulate gastric emptying**************************************************************************************************************************************************
    1. *******************************Extent of stomach filling, or gastric volume determines gastric emptying.*******************************
        
        Increase in gastric volume, results in distension of the stomach, which triggers a local myenteric reflex in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]], that accentuates the activity of the pyloric pump and relaxes the pyloric sphincter, thus promoting gastric emptying.
        
    2. ********************************************************************Gastrin has mild to moderate activity to stimulate gastric emptying.********************************************************************
        
        Distension of the stomach as well as presence of partially digested protein stimulates G cells in the pylorus to release gastrin.
        
        Gastrin enters circulation and returns to the stomach, and mildly stimulates the pyloric pump, thus promoting gastric emptying.
