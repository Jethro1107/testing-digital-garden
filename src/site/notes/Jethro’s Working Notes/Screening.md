### Screening

Screening is the prime example of **************secondary prevention**************, that aims to improve survival by delaying onset and duration of clinical disease.

- **********************************************Definition of screening**********************************************
    
    Screening is the *presumptive identification* of an unrecognized disease or defect in an otherwise healthy individual by the application of tests, examinations, or other procedures that can be applied rapidly.
    
    The logic behind screening is that by screening otherwise healthy individuals, we may identify individuals who *****may***** have the disease but is assymptomatic. ************This prompts early diagnosis, early and more effective treatment, and hence improves survival, and reduces morbidity and mortality.************
    
- ********************************************************A screening test favours sensitivity over specificity********************************************************
    
    By manipulating cut-off values of a test, we can achieve a trade off in sensitivity and specificity.
    
    A screening test tends to favour sensitivity over specificity as we don’t want to miss people with the disease.
    
- ****Predictive values are useful for evaluating to whom screening tests are applied to****
    
    When applied to the right population (i.e. population with high incidence of the disease), we can greatly improve the positive predictive values, which can then improve yield of the screening program.
