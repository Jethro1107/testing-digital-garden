### Cephalosporins

Cephalosporins are broad-spectrum *beta-lactam* antibiotics. Cephalosporins are *bactericidal*.

- **MOA of cephalosporin**
    
    Transpeptidation / Peptidoglycan NAM-NAM cross link is catalysed by penicillin binding protein, which has transpeptidase (TPase) activity.
    
    Cephalosporin covalently binds to PBP, thus inhibiting TPase activity.
    
    This inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis.
    
- **Susceptibility to beta-lactamase**
    
    Cephalosporins inhibit beta-lactamase action, but there is a slow emergence of cephalosporin resistance.
    
- Classification of cephalosporin
    - 1st generation cephalosporin
        - **Examples of 1st generation cephalosporin**
            
            Cefadroxil, cephalexin
            
        - **Spectrum of 1st generation cephalosporin**
            
            Greatest activity against gram positive bacteria.
            
            Active against most community acquired enterobacter.
            
    - 2nd generation cephalosporin
        - **Examples of 2nd generation cephalosporin**
            
            Cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefoxitin
            
        - **Spectrum of 2nd generation cephalosporin**
            
            Expanded activity against gram negative bacteria.
            
            Active against gram positive bacteria.
            
    - 3rd generation cephalosporin
        - **Examples of 3rd generation cephalosporin**
            
            Ceftriaxone, cefperazone, cefixime, cefotaxime, cefotizoxime, ceftazidime
            
        - **Spectrum of 3rd generation cephalosporin**
            
            Mainly active against gram negative bacteria.
            
            Less effective against gram positive bacteria.
            
    - 4th generation cephalosporin
        - **Examples of 4th generation cephalosporin**
            
            Cefepime
            
        - **Spectrum of 4th generation cephalosporin**
            
            Wide bacterial spectrum.
            
            More resistant to Beta-lactamase.
            
    - 5th generation cephalosporin
        - **Examples of 5th generation cephalosporin**
            
            Ceftaroline (MRSA-active), ceftolazane
            
        - **Spectrum of 5th generation cephalosporin**
            
            Broadest spectrum of activity among cephalosporin.
            
- **Adverse effects of cephalosporin**
    
    Type I hypersensitivity reaction and rash in 5% of patients
    
    Diarrhoea
    
    Intestinal nephritis
    
    Neurotoxicity at high doses
    
    Coagulopathy
