### Vertical muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall

The two vertical muscles contributing to the anterolateral abdominal wall are located near the midline of the body, which are the larger *rectus abdominis* and *pyramidalis.*

The vertical muscles are surrounded by the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rectus sheath\|Rectus sheath]] .

- **Rectus abdominis**
    - The rectus abdominis is a long paired muscles separated by the linea alba *(The linea alba is a fibrous structure that extends from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis)*, spanning the length of the anterolateral abdominal wall.
    - It originates from the 5th to 7th costal cartilages and inserts at the pubic crest.
    - Along its course, it is intersected by three or four tendinous intersections transversely.

- **Pyramidalis**
    - Pyramidalis may not be present in some individuals.
    - A small triangular muscle anterior to the inferior part of the rectus abdominis.
    - It’s base attaches to the base of the pubic bone, and its apex attaches superiorly and medially to the linea alba.
