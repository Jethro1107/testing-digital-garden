### LO I.3: Cardiac enzymes have variable specificity and sensitivity for cardiac damage, and are released at different time courses of MI

1. Myoglobin
    
    Kinetics: Early peak (an early marker for MI), but rapidly returned back to normal
    
    Non-cardiac specific
    
2. Creatine Kinase
    
    Kinetics: Early peak (rapid release after MI)
    
    There are three isoforms, CK-MB, CK-MM, CK-BB
    
    CK-MB is the isoform that is most useful in myocardial infarction, as it is concentrated in myocardiocytes, and relatively low concentration in skeletal muscles
    
    However, due to the minute presence in skeletal muscles, it is not 100% cardiac specific
    
3. Cardiac Troponin
    
    Troponin I and Troponin T are good biomarkers for MI as they are cardiac specific
    
    Kinetics:
    
    Troponin T shows a biphasic curve
    
    Cytosolic TnT is released within  3-4 hours of infarction
    
    Myofibrillar TnT is released over a few days
    
    Hence, there is an early rise, and sustained levels of TnT over days
    
    Troponin I shows a single peak, where TnI is released within 4 hours of infarction and peaks at around 14-18 hours
    
    TnI remains elevated for around a week
    
    Troponin levels must be above Upper reference limit (99th percentile) to indicate myocardial necrosis
    

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Aspartate transaminase (AST) are no longer used due to their lack of specificity

### LO II.2: STEMI, NSTEMI and unstable angina are different entities encompassed by the term Acute coronary syndrome

Acute coronary syndrome encompasses all acute deadly clinicopathological manifestations of IHD - STEMI, NSTEMI and Unstable angina. While [[IHD is often caused by stable atheromatous stenosis\|IHD is often caused by stable atheromatous stenosis]], acute coronary syndrome is often caused by acute plaque change.

STEMI - ST segment elevation MI (ST segment elevations on certain leads, accompanied by elevated cardiac enzymes)

STEMI usually indicate transmural infarctions, where NSTEMI indicates subendocardial infarctions

**One must be able to identify the different entities of ACS as this prompts different management**

### LO II.3: Management of myocardial infarctions - NSTEMI and STEMI requires different management

NSTEMI:

High risk patients - Coronary angiography

Low risk patients - Anti-platelet (Aspirin, Clopidogrel), anticoagulant (Unfractioned heparin) and anti-ischaemic therapy (beta-blockers, nitrates)

STEMI:

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention

Coronary bypass surgery

Thrombolysis

### LO I.4: Anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants are administered following a myocardial infarction to avoid thrombosis

The principle of anti-platelet agents and anticoagulants is to avoid superimposed thrombosis and embolisation that further occludes the artery

| Antiplatelet agents | Aspirin | Clopidogrel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MOA | Aspirin is a COX1 inhibitors, which inhibits thromboxane A2 synthesis
Thromboxane A2 upregulates GpIIb/IIIa complex, which is required for binding to fibrinogen, enabling the formation of a platelet plug | Clopidogrel inhibits P2Y12 receptors on platelets, preventing the binding of ADP
This prevents the upregulation of GpIIb/IIIa complex, thus prevents platelet aggregation and formation of platelet plug |

Anticoagulant - Unfractioned Heparin

MOA: Activates Antithrombin III, which degrades Xa and thrombin, inhibiting the coagulation cascade
