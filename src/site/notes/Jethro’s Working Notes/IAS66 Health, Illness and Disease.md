### Health, Illness and Disease

- How does the western scientific medical model of health view the concept of health?
    
    Views it as the absence of disease, illness, infirmity, injury or disability
    
    Focuses on the negative meaning - Western medicine is to restore normal functioning (or health) of the body (curative care)
    
    Mechanistic - Treats the body like a machine
    
- Give examples of lay concept of health. What are the factors causing the difference in the concept of health among lay people?
    
    Absence of disease (-ve)
    
    Being able to carry out daily activity (more functional)
    Being fit and active (+ve)
    Varys with age, gender, social class - but ultimately a result of differences in belief of internal and external locus of control
    
- What is the WHO's definition of health? What is the advantage of this definition?
    
    A state of complete physical, mental and social well being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity
    
    This definition has a more holistic view on health: including both the positive and negative aspects of health
    
    It also shows that health is multi-dimensional: including the physical, mental and social dimensions
    
- How can disease be viewed? What are the limitations of such views?
    
    A physical abnormality - then how is normality defined?
    
    Evidence of infection - then what about the normal flora?
    
    Disorder in structure or functions - then what about psychological disorders
    
    Disease is measurable and detectable, and diagnosis of disease requires the exercise of professional power
    
- If disease is abnormality, then what is normality? What is the limitation?
    
    Statistical definition - Extreme values
    
    However, extreme values may just be statistical outliers, but do not necessarily indicate disease
    
- What is the limitations of disease being viewed as abnormality?
    
    This model of disease is too person-centred, but does not focus on certain groups, as disease reflects community problems in terms of cause, spread, costs and consequences
    
    This model also implies that disease is temporarily bound, having begining and end, but it overlooks self-limiting disease or chronic disease
    
    This model also overlooks the behavorial, lifestyle and environmental factors
    
    Ultimately, it makes disease independent of ecological context
    
- What is illness?
    
    Subjected state of unwellness, independent of physical abnormality
    
    Has complex psychosocial components (how patient is experience his symptoms in his social roles)
    
    A key determinant of consultation behavior - People consult doctors when they are ill
    
- Use a table to show the relationship between disease and illness.

### Sickness

- What is a social deviance?
    
    Any characteristic or behaviors that violates the social norms within a given social system
    
    Involves social judgement instead of variation in statistical values
    
    Deviance is a relative concept as it is subjected to changes in social norms and values
    
    Deviance is related to exercise of power (Power sets normality rules)
    
- How may sickness be viewed as a social deviance?
    
    Sickness is a social state formed from human perception
    
    A state that the normal social functions of those who are ill is impaired
    
    Doctors play the gate-keeping role, determining who's sickness can be legitimized
    
- What is a sickness role?
    
    Sickness role is described as the normative behavior a person typically adopts when feeling sick
    
    People who enter sickness role are exempt from normal social role responsibility but carry obligations (rest, take medicine, follow doctors orders)
    
    The public acknowledge change of status to provide support
    
- What is the limitation of sickness as a social deviance?
    
    May ignore the biological aspect of sickness, thus shifting interventions for illness to being primarily social rather than medical
    
    Can put people at a disadvantage position due to stigma
    
- What is stigma? What are the three forms of stigma?
    
    A label that changes the way an individual is viewed in a society, typically in a negative way
    
    Three forms of stigma:
    
    Physical - Appearance (Obesity, Baldness), and physical function (blindness, amputee)
    
    Blemishes of individual character - Disease linked to behavior that is judged to be morally wrong (HIV, suicidal tendencies)
    
    Tribal attributes - Race, religion, nationality
    
- What is the impact of stigma?
    1. Psychological stress for stigmatized people - Negatively affect their self-concept and self-esteem
    2. Avoid or delay seeking healthcare (As their condition may be stigmatized, which would negatively impact their life)
    3. Affect quality of care and access to healthcare

### Ecological Model of Health, Illness and Disease

- What is the ecological model of health, illness and disease?
    
    A systematic framework to explain different level of influence on health, illness or disease, including biological, behavioural, psychological, social, and environmental/political.
    
    Different levels of influence may interact with each other:
    
    e.g. Psychological stress may impact behavior of individual, like smoking or alcohol consumption
    

### Epidemiological Transition

- What is epidemiological transition?
    
    Changes in pattern in health and disease and the interactions of these patterns and their demographic, economic, and sociologic determinants and consequences in a given population
    
    Changes in disease patterns arise due to changes in biological, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental context
    
- Describe the changes in disease pattern in the 20th century.
    
    Transition from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases
    
- What contributes to the changes in disease pattern?
    1. Changes in life expectancy
        
        Due to end of wars, pandemic, improved nutrition and sanitation
        
        Most people survive to adulthood, such that they are exposed to diseases in adults like cancer, and cardiovascular diseases
        
    2. Changes in living condition
        
        Due to industrialization, contributing to manufacturing of food, housing, and environmental sanitation
        
        A better living condition would reduce exposure to infection, thus reducing incidence of infectious diseases
        
        It also reduces risk of infant mortality, such that most people survive to adulthood and are exposed to diseases of adults
        
    3. Changes in lifestyle
        
        Due to industrialization and modernization, changing how people live and work
        
        Reduces peoples level of physical activity and icreases smoking, alcohol and fat consumption, contributing to non-communicable diseases
        
    4. Changes in community and family
        
        More individualistic society - Decrease in community and family ties
        
        Contribute to increase in mental health
        
        But has also led to epidemic of loneliness
        
    5. Changes in social value
        
        Sexual revolution ⇒ contribute to rapid transmission of STD
        
        Feminism movement ⇒ contribute to increase pregnancy age, reduction in fertility, smaller family size and better maternal and neonatal care
        
    6. Development of modern medicine
        
        Development in vaccines and antibiotics has reduced or eliminate some infectious disease
        
        But other factors contribute to epidemiological  transitions more than advancement in medicine
        
    7. Environmental degradation

### Implications

- How does understanding of disease-illness relationship affect clinical practice?
    
    Not all diseased patients seek treatment
    
    Not all patients seeking treatment are diseased
    
    Most paitients are ill rather than having diseases
    
    Different approaches may be needed for different problems (disease vs illness)
    
- How does understanding of epidemiological transition affect how we spend our money in medicine?
    
    Economic, behavorial, psychological, social, cultural, and environmental factors are more important contributors to reduction in mortality than medical care
    
    Hence, prevention is the best approach to further reductions in mortality
    
    More money should be spent on prevention
    
- How does the understanding of ecological context of disease affect the distribution of responsibility in disease?
    
    Pathology decontextualizes biological problems from more distal causes
    
    Individuals shouldn't take sole responsibility for their health and well-being, state responsibility is required as they affect the ecological context of diseases
    
- How does medical practice serve as a social control mechanism?
    
    Medical practitioners serve as gatekeepers to legitimate sick roles
    
    They try to reduce disruption of sickness for individual and the society and try to return the sick to normal social functions as quick as possible to maintain social stability
