### Effects of valvular heart disease

- **Responses to valvular injury**
    
    Mechanical injury - results in superficial fibrous thickening over preserved architecture
    
    Inflammation - Invariably leads to vascularisation of structure, and fibrosis, which contracts to decrease size and surface area
    
    Degenerative changes - Distortion and increase in size due to deposition of calcium salts, cholesterol etc.
    
- **Effects of valvular disease**
    - Stenosis - failure of the valve to open completely, obstructing forward flow
        - Mitral stenosis
            - **Common cause of mitral stenosis**
                
                Post inflammatory scarring (rheumatic heart disease)
                
            - **Effects of mitral stenosis**
                
                Mitral stenosis causes decreased outflow from left atrium to left ventricle, causing increased atrial volume and pressure, resulting in atrial dilitation
                
                Atrial dilatation increases the risk of atrial thrombus, resulting in systemic embolization
                
                Pooling of blood in the atrium eventually results in damming of blood in the pulmonary circulation, resulting in pulmonary oedema and pulmonary hypertension
                
                Pulmonary hypertension results in right heart hypertrophy, and thus right heart failure

        - Aortic stenosis
            - **Common cause of aortic stenosis**
                
                Post inflammatory scarring (rheumatic heart disease)
                
                Senile calcific aortic stenosis
                
                Calcification of congenitally deformed valve (bicuspid aortic valve)
                
            - **Effects of aortic stenosis**
                
                Aortic stenosis causes decreased outflow of blood from left ventricle to aorta
                
                This results in increased left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular ejection time, left ventricular diastolic pressure and decreased aortic pressure
                
                Elevated left ventricular systolic pressure causes left ventricular hypertrophy resulting in left ventricular dysfunction and hence left heart failure
                
                Elevated left ventricular ejection time increases systolic time and decreases diastolic time, hence, increasing myocardial demand and reducing coronary perfusion, thus contributing to myocardial ischaemia
                
                Elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure also reduces coronary perfusion, causing myocardial ischaemia
                
                Decreased aortic pressure results in reduced coronary perfusion, causing myocardial ischaemia
                
                ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                
    - Incompetency - failure of a valve to close completely, thereby allowing regurgitation of blood
    - Mixed

### Common valvular disease

- **Degenerative valve disease**
    - Calcific aortic stenosis
        - **Epidemeology of calcific aortic stenosis**
            
            Most common valvular abnormality
            
            Usually affects elderly where onset in the elderly:
            
            50s and 60s in congenital bicuspid aortic valve individuals
            
            70s and 80s in individuals with normal valves
            
        - **Pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis**
            
            Caused by degenerative calcification induced by wear and tear of the valve
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Pathology of calcific aortic stenosis**
            
            Heaped-up calcified masses in the aortic sinus that impeds cuspal opening
            
            Cf: [[Robbins  Pathology of calcified aortic stenosis\|Robbins  Pathology of calcified aortic stenosis]] 
            
        - **Clinical signs and symptoms of calcific aortic stenosis**
            
            Signs - Small amplitude pulse (decreased pulse pressure), displaced apex beat (LV hypertrophy), systolic thrill, systolic ejection murmur (turbulent flow at aortic valve)

    - Mitral annular calcification
        - **Pathology of mitral annular calcification**
            
            Degenerative calcific deposits of the ring of the mitral valve
            
            Grossly appear as irregular, stony hard, occasionally ulcerated nodules at the base of the heart
            
            ![[4167719D-CA3E-4DFF-8033-F19FCD5B0196.jpeg\|4167719D-CA3E-4DFF-8033-F19FCD5B0196.jpeg]]
            
            C - Left atrial view, D - Cut section of myocardial showing lateral wall with dense calcification that extends into the underlying myocardium
            
        - **Outcome of mitral annular calcification**
            
            Generally does not affect valvular function
            
            May result in:
            
            Mitral regurgitation - by interfering with physiologic contraction of the valve ring
            
            Stenosis - by impairing opening of mitral leaflets
            
            Arrhythmia and sudden death - by penetration of calcium deposits to impinge on the atrioventricular conduction system
            
        - **Clinical features of mitral annular calcification**
            
            Systolic murmurs in half of the patients
            
    - Myxomatous degeneration of mitral valves (mitral valve prolapse)
        - **What is mitral valve prolapse?**
            
            In myxomatous degeneration of mitral valves, mitral valves become floppy and prolapse into the left atrium, resulting in mitral regurgitation
            
        - **Pathogenesis of mitral valve prolapse**
            
            Pathogenesis is unclear, but is associated with intrinsic defect of connective tissue synthesis and remodelling
            
            Associated with Marfan syndrome (a syndrome involving mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin)
            
        - **Gross pathology of mitral valve prolapse**
            
            Ballooning of the mitral leaflets into the left atrium
            
            Leaflets are often enlarged, thick and rubbery

- Rheumatic heart disease
    
    
    - **What is acute rheumatic fever?**
        
        Acute rheumatic fever is the valvular damage caused by Type II hypersensitvity response to GAS infection
        
    
    - **Consequence of acute rheumatic fever**
        
        Repeated episodes of acute rheumatic fever as a result of GAS infection can consequentially result in:
        
        Rheumatic heart disease, the permanent valvular damage due to acute rheumatic fever
        
    - **Which valve is usually involved in rheumatic heart disease?**
        
        Mitral valve
        
        Aortic valve and other valves involvement is also common

- Infective endocarditis
    
    
    - **What is infective endocarditis?**
        
        Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the heart valves or the mural endocardium that leads to the formation of vegetations composed of thrombotic debris and organisms, often associated with destruction of the underlying cardiac tissue
        
    - **Common heart valves involved in infective endocarditis**
        
        Most common sites involve the left heart valves (mitral valve and aortic valve)
        
        Tricuspid valve is a frequent target in the setting of intravenous drug abuse
        
    - **Risk factors of infective endocarditis**
        
        Infective endocarditis can develop in previously normal valves, but ‘diseased’ valves (i.e. calcific aortic stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease, bicuspid aortic valves etc.) are common substrates
        
        Intravenous drug abuse also increase the risk of IE 
        
    - **Complications of infective endocarditis**
        
        Abscess formation (by eroding into underlying myocardium)
        
        Sepsis
        
        Septic emboli
        
        Destruction of valves
        
    - **Other causes of endocarditis**
        
        Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis
        
        Libman-Sacks endocarditis (Endocarditis in SLE)

        Mechanical, tissue
        
    - **Complications of prosthetic valves**
        
        Risk of structural failure - requires replacement with time
        
        Risk of thrombosis
        
        Risk of infective endocarditis
        
- Valvular anuloplasty
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
- Baloon valvuloplasty
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
- Anticoagulation therapy
    
    Many patients with valvular disease are maintained on anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis and systemic embolization
