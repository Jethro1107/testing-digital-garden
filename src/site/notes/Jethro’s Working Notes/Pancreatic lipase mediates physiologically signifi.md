### Pancreatic lipase mediates physiologically significant fat digestion in the small intestine

Due to small surface area, action of lingual lipase and gastric lipase is physiologically insignificant, and only accounts for digestion of 10% of dietary triglycerides.

Furthermore, in the stomach, lipids liquify at body temperature, causing them to float towards the surface of gastric contents. This renders a small surface area for action of gastric lipase.

However, in the small intestine, bile salt emulsifies lipids into smaller lipid droplets ([[Emulsification of lipids into lipid droplets is a key preliminary step to fat digestion\|Emulsification of lipids into lipid droplets is a key preliminary step to fat digestion]]), which increases surface area for pancreatic lipase act on.
