### Tubulointerstitial disease

- Acute tubular injury/ Acute tubular necrosis
    - **What is acute tubular injury?**
        
        Acute tubular injury (previously known as acute tubular necrosis) is characterised by acute renal failure and often, but not invariably, morphological evidence of tubular injury, in the the forms of necrosis of tubular epithelial cells
        
    - **Clinical manifestation of acute tubular injury**
        
        Manifests as acute renal failure/ acute kidney injury
        
    - **Etiology of acute tubular injury**
        1. Ischaemic injury (90%)
            
            Due to shock (prerenal cause)
            
            Due to diffuse involvement of renal blood vessels in malignant hypertension
            
            Due to thrombosis e.g. thrombotic microangiopathy
            
        2. Direct toxin injury
            
            Endogenous agents - myoglobin, haemoglobin, monoclonal light chain, bile/ bilirubin
            
            Exogenous agents - drugs, radiocontrast dyes, heavy metals, organic solvents
            
        3. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis
        4. Urinary obstruction
    - **Pathogenesis of acute tubular injury**
    - **Pathology of acute tubular injury**
        
        Necrosis of tubular epithelium
        
        Tubular occlusion by casts
        
        Dilated tubules with flattened epithelial cells
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Clinical features of acute tubular injury**
        
        Classical presentation of acute tubular injury may be divided into three stages: initiation phase, maintenance phase and recovery phase
        
        Initiation phase (around 36 hours) - slightly reduced urine output (oliguria) with rise in BUN and serum creatinine
        
        Maintenance phase - sustained decreases in urine output (40-400ml/day), or oliguria
        
        This results in salt and water overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and other manifestations of uraemia
        
        Recovery phase - steady increase in urine output, up to 3L of day
        
        As tubules are still damage, there is large loss of Na+, K+ and water
        
- Tubulointerstital nephritis/ interstitial nephritis
    - **What is tubulointerstitial nephritis?**
        
        Tubulointerstitial nephritis refers to a group of disease characterised by the inflammation of the interstitium and tubules
        
    - **Etiology of tubulointerstitial nephritis**
        - Drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis
            - **Causative agents of drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis**
                
                Any drugs, herbal remedies
                
            - **Pathogenesis of drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis**
                
                A hypersensitivity reaction to medications (Type I or Type IV hypersensitivity reaction)
                
                Most likely, drugs function as haptens bind to the antigens on plasma membrane of tubular epithelial cells to become immunogenic
                
            - **Histopathology of drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis**
                
                Interstitial inflammation - mononuclear inflammatory cells and eosinophilia (pointing to drug cause)
                
                Tubulitis - inflammatory cells located in between tubular cells
                
                Interstitial oedema (acute) interstitial fibrosis

        - Pyelonephritis
            - What is pyelonephritis?
                
                Pyelonephritis is the most common renal disease, defined as inflammation of the interstitium, tubules and renal pelvis
                
            - Two major forms of pyelonephritis

                    - **Outcome of acute pyelonephritis**
                        
                        Uncomplicated - full resolution with little effect on renal functions
                        
                        Complications:
                        
                        Pyelonephrosis - collection of pus in the calyces, pelvis and ureter

                - Chronic pyelonephritis
                    - **What is chronic pyelonephritis?**
                        
                        Chronic pyelonephritis is characterised by chronic tubulointerstitial inflammation and scarring involving the calyces and the renal pelvis
                        
                    - **Histopathology of chronic pyelonephritis**
                        1. Tubulointerstitial injury
                            
                            Interstitial inflammation with mononuclear inflammatory exudates
                            
                            Interstitial fibrosis
                            
                            Tubular damage and tubular atrophy
                            
                        2. Glomerular involvement
                            
                            Chronic pyelonephritis may result in decreasing number of functional glomeruli due to nephron loss
                            
                            This results in compensatory hypertrophy of remaining functional glomeruli 
                            
                            This compensation is maladaptive as it results in fibrosis of the glomeruli/ focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
                            
                            Glomerulosclerosis results in further decrease in number of functional glomeruli, thus initiating a vicious cycle of progressive glomerulosclerosis
                            
                    - **Treatment of chronic pyelonephritis**
                        
                        Treatment of recurrent acute pyelonephritis with antibiotic therapy
                        
                        Treatment of underlying cause
                        
                    - **Outcome of chronic pyelonephritis**
                        
                        Depends on extent of scarring
                        
                        If loss of large amounts of renal tissue, it may progress into CKD and ESRD

                90% of patients are 50 years old or older
