### **What is membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis?**

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis refers to the a pattern of injury rather than a specific disease that is manifested histologically by alterations in the GBM and mesangium and by proliferation of glomerular cells

### **Classification of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis**

- Type I MPGN
    - **Cause of Type I MPGN**
        
        Idiopathic MPGN
        
        Secondary MPGN:
        
        Due to deposition of circulating immune complex or formation of immune complex in situ with a planted antigen

    - **Pathogenesis of Type I MPGN**
        
        Subendothelial immune complex deposits, resulting in the activation of classical and alternative complement pathway
        
    - **Glomerular pathology of Type I MPGN**
        
        Light microscopy - Membranoproliferative pattern, with proliferation of mesangial, endothelial cells as well as infiltrating leukocytes, as well as GBM thickening and splitting

        Immunofluorscence microscopy - Granular IgG and C3 along GBM and mesangium
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Electron microscopy - Subendothelial deposits and basement membrane splitting
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
- Type II MPGN (Dense deposit disease)
- Type III MPGN (C3 glomerulonephritis)

### **Treatment of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis**

Treatment of underlying cause of secondary MPGN

Steroids not useful

Drug targetting complement pathway for C3 GN

### **Outcome of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis**

50% develop chronic renal failure within 10 years
