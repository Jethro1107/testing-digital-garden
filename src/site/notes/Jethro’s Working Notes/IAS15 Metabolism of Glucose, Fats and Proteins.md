Updated: June 18, 2022 11:20 AM

# Defining the questions

- Learning Outcomes
    
    Describe the characteristic of the train of events in biosynthesis
    
    Describe uniqueness of the three principal sources of supply of carbon atoms
    
    Identify the biological questions that influence the design of metabolism
    
- What is the train of events for Biosynthesis?
    
    Atoms → Simple molecules → Complex molecules → Molecular assemblies → organelles → cells → tissues → organs → human body
    
    Non-random process ⇒ energy and material required, both provided by C atom
    
- Why is carbon said to have dual functionality?
    
    Can be used for both energy release and biosynthesis
    
    - Why is there a need for balance for the two functions of carbon?
        
        Need for balance:
        
        If too much C atoms is used for energy release, not enough is left for biosynthesis
        
        if too much C atoms is used for biosynthesis, not enough is left for energy release, which would halt biosynthesis as the process requires energy

- Defining the questions
    1. How can carbon atoms be distributed for energy release and biosynthesis?
    2. What is the significance of carbon atoms in fats?
    3. How to reserve unconsumed carbon atoms for later use?

# Glucose, Fats and Proteins

- Learning Outcomes
    
    Discuss how carbon atoms from glucose can be used for energy release and biosynthesis
    
    Discuss the interplay between glucose, amino acids and fats metabolism (metabolic integration)
    
- Glucose C atoms for energy release
    - What is yielded when Glucose C atoms are used for energy release?
        
        Glycolysis: yield 2 pyruvate, 2 NADH and 2 ATP
        
        TCA cycle: yield CO2, electrons (in electron carriers) and H+
        
        ETC: Create proton gradient and electrical potential in the membrane to yield more ATP
        
- How is glucose C atoms used for biosynthesis?
    
    Intermediates of glycolysis and TCA cycle can be used for biosynthesis of amino acids
    
    Pyruvate from glycolysis is used for fatty acid synthesis and the formation of triacylglycerol by lipogenesis
    
    Glucose is also involved in the synthesis of glycogen (glycogenesis)
    
    Glucose is also involved in the synthesis of ribose to form nucleic acids
    
    To put it simply, there are two ways C atoms are used for biosynthesis:
    
    1. C atoms in glucose involved in biosynthesis of amino acids and ribose
    2. C atoms in glucose involved in building reserves in forms of triacylglycerol and glycogen
- Can glucose be our only source of C?
    - What is integrated metabolism?
        
        Idea of integrated metabolism - Glucose metabolism is unavoidably linked to the metabolism of fats and amino acids
        
    - By that logic, can glucose be our only source of C atoms?
        
        By the above logic glucose can be our only source of carbon atoms, but there are three problems arising:
        
        1. Essential fatty acids cannot be made by our cells and must be obtained from our diet
        2. Essential amino acids cannot be made by our cells and must be obtained from our diet
        3. N atom for amino acid synthesis comes from non-glucose compounds, often prevailing amino acids present in cells
        
        Functions of the three metabolites are not limited to supply C atoms
        

# Metabolic integration and its significance

- Learning Outcome
    
    Discuss the strategy used to ensure a continuous supply of carbon atoms to the human body
    
    Discuss the characteristics of a useful metabolic reserves
    
    DEscribe the concept of whole body metabolism
    
- Why is there a need for metabolic reserves?
    
    Unconsumed C atoms can be stored as reserves to provide C atoms when the supply of C atoms is interrupted
    
- Whole body metabolism in building reserves
    - How are glycogen and triacylglycerol stored in individual cells?
        
        Most cells can store reserves, triacylglycerol as small lipid droplets and glycogen as small glycogen granules
        
    - What is the problem with just storing reserves in individual cells? How can it be solved?
        
        Limited space of cells results in limited capacity for holding reserves ⇒ Solved by whole body metabolism
        
        3 major metabolic stores - liver, adipose tissues and skeletal muscles
        
    - Where are glycogen and triacylglycerol stored?
        
        ![[/Screenshot 2021-09-17 at 10.34.56 AM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-09-17 at 10.34.56 AM.png]]
        
        Interpretation:
        
        Both skeletal muscles and liver can convert glucose into glycogen by glycogenesis
        
        Muscle glycogen is reserved for muscles during contraction
        
        Liver glycogen is readily broken down into glucose and released into blood when needed
        
        Both skeletal muscles and liver can convert glucose to pyruvate by glycolysis
        
        In skeletal muscles, pyruvate is transported in blood as lactate to adipocytes, and is converted to triacylglycerol for storage
        
        In liver, pyruvate is converted to triacylglycerol, which is transported in blood as VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) to adipocytes for storage
        

# Coordinated accumulation and mobilization of metabolic reserves: Reciprocal regulation

- Learning Outcome
    
    Describe how the N atom is removed from amino acids
    
    Recognize that Insulin to glucagon ratio as a signal for the accumulation and mobilization of metabolic reserves
    
    Discuss the significance of coordinated metabolic regulation
    
- Utilization of amino acids for energy release and biosynthesis
    - When is amino acids used for energy release and biosynthesis?
        
        If glycogen reserves in liver runs out, amino acids will be used for biosynthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis)
        
    - What types of amino acids can be used for gluconeogenesis?
        
        Only glucogenic amino acids can be used for gluconeogenesis
        
    - Outline the steps for the utilization of amino acids for gluconeogenesis
        1. Skeletal muscle proteins are broken down into amino acids
        2. Amino acid undergoes transamination/deamination in the liver to remove the N atom, forming pyruvate
        3. Pyruvate is converted to Glucose-6-P in the liver by gluconeogenesis
        4. Glucose-6-P is converted to glucose by dephosphorylation
        5. Glucose is used either for energy release or biosynthesis
- Mobilization of reserves
    
    Mobilization of reserves only occur at low blood glucose level
    
    1. Pancreatic chemoreceptors detect decrease in blood glucose level and responds by decreasing insulin secretion and increasing glucagon secretion ⇒ low insulin:glucagon ratio
    2. Low ratio stimulates glycogenolysis by the liver
    3. Low ratio also stimulates adipocytes to break down triacylglycerol into fatty acids and released into the blood
    4. Liver takes up fatty acids and oxidize it into Acetyl-CoA, which is converted to ketone bodies (acetoacetone, beta-hydroxylbutyrate, and acetone), which is released into the blood
    5. Ketone bodies are taken up by our cells and converted back to Acetyl-CoA and fed into TCA cycle
    6. Skeletal muscles also pick up fatty acids and oxidize it into Acetyl-CoA for consumption by skeletal muscles
- Reciprocal regulation to separate accumulation and mobilization
    
    Reciprocal regulation of metabolism must be coordinated to avoid accumulation and mobilization to occur at the same time
    
    High Insulin : Glucagon ratio - favours accumulation:
    
    - Stimulates Glycolysis, glycogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, lipogenesis
    - Inhibits gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, Beta-oxidation of fatty acid
    
    Low Insulin : Glucagon ratio - favours mobilisation:
    
    - Stimulates gluconeogenisis, glycogenolysis, Beta-oxidation of fatty acids
    - Inhibits glycolysis, glycogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, lipogenesis

# Enzymes and Reciprocal Regulation (to favour gluconeogenesis)

- Learning Outcome
    
    Identify the control enzymes in pairs of opposing pathways
    
    Describe how the control enzymes are regulated in response to change in insulin to glucagon levels
    
- Recirpocal Regulation between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
    - Draw a diagram illustrating the opposing pathways of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
        
        ![[/Screenshot 2021-09-24 at 3.35.04 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-09-24 at 3.35.04 PM.png]]
        
- In a fasted state, what metabolic pathways are preferred?
    
    Gluconeogenesis
    
    - What are the three things to ensure that there is net gluconeogenesis?
        
        More pyruvate to commit to gluconeogenesis
        
        Discourage fructose 6-P from forming fructose-1,6-P2
        
        Facilitate more fructose 1,6-P2 convert to fructose-6-P
        
- Committing pyruvate to gluconeogenesis
    - What enzyme is responsible for converting pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate?
        
        Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)
        
    - How is commitment of pyruvate to gluconeogenesis regulated?
        
        PEPCK gene expression is dependent on insulin:glucagon ratio
        
        It is inhibited by insulin and stimulated by glucagon
        
        1. Low insulin:glucagon ratio stimulates PEPCK gene expression
        2. More PEPCK is formed to convert pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate
        3. More pyruvate is committed to gluconeogenesis
- Fructose-6-P and Fructose-1.6-P2
    - Which two pairs of control enzymes are responsible for the interonversion between Fructose 6-P and Fructose 1,6-P2?
        
        Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) is responsible for the conversion of F-6-P to F-1,6-P2 (glycolytic pathway)
        
        Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is responsible for the conversion of F-1,6-P2 back to F-6-P (gluconeogenic pathway)
        
    - How are the activity of two enzymes controlled?
        
        Their activity is affected by the same allosteric regulator - Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
        
        F-2,6-P2 activates PFK1 and inhibits Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
        
        By that logic, to promote gluconeogenesis, a low F-2,6-P2 level is required
        
    - How is the level of Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate controlled? (Write down on paper)
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Synthesis and degradation of Fructose-2,6-P2 is carried out by the same enzyme - Phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2), which has a kinase catalytic domain and a phosphatase catalytic domain
        
        Glucagon stimulates phosphorylation while insulin stimulates dephosphorylation
        
        In low insulin:glucagon ratio:
        
        1. PFK2 is phosphorylated
        2. Phosphorylated PFK2 has low kinase/high phosphatase activity, favouring the conversion of F-2,6-P2 to F-6-P
        3. Low level of F-2,6-P results in increase in fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity and a decrease in PFK 1 activity
        4. This facilitates the conversion of F-1,6-P2 to F-6-P, and prevent F-6-P from being converted to F-1,6-P2
        
        In high insulin to glucagon ratio:
        
        1. PFK2 remains in unphosphorylated state
        2. Unphosphorylated PFK2 has high kinase/low phosphatase activity, favouring the conversion of F-6-P to F-2,6-P2
        3. High level of F-2,6-P2 results in increase in PFK1 activity and decrease in fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity
        4. This facilitates the conversion of F-6-P to F-1,6-P2, and prevent F-1,6-P2 from being converted back to F-6-P
- Pyruvate kinase in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
    - How is pyruvate kinase (PK) involved in the glycolytic pathway?
        
        It is involved in the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate
        
    - How is activity of PK controlled?
        
        PK is active when unphosphorylated
        
        In fed state, high insulin:glucagon ratio allows PK to remain unphosphorylated, favouring the glycolytic pathway
        
        In fast state, low insulin:glucagon level results in phosphorylation of PK, which becomes inactive
        
- Reciprocal control of glycogen synthesis and glycogen breakdown
    - What pair of control enzymes are responsible for glycogenesis and glycogenolysis?
        
        Glycogen phosphatase is responsible of breakdown of glycogen into glucose
        
        Glycogen synthase is responsible of synthesis of glycogen from glucose
        
    - How are the activities of the two enzymes controlled?
        - Glycogen Phosphatase
            
            Glycogen Phosphatase is active when phosphorylated
            
            In fast state, low insulin:glucagon ratio results in phosphorylation of glycogen phosphatase, making it active
            
        - Glycogen Synthase
            
            Glycogen synthase is active when unphosphorylated
            
            In fed state, high insulin:glucagon ratio allows glycogen synthase to remain unphosphorylated, making it active
            
- Reciprocal control of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation
    - Describe the mechanism for reciprocal regulation of fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation
        
        Malonyl-CoA inhibits the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-xoidation
        
- Other regulatory signal for PFK1
    - Other than levels of Fructose-2,6-P2, what acts as regulatory signals for PFK1?
        
        ATP:AMP ratio
        
        [[Jethro’s Working Notes/IAS15 Metabolism of Glucose, Fats and Proteins/Concept of Energy Charge\|Concept of Energy Charge]]
        
    - How does this serve as a regulatory signal for PFK1?
        
        When ATP:AMP ratio decreases, there is a low [[energy charge\|energy charge]], which stimulates the activity of PFK1, commiting F-6-P via the glycolytic pathway such that more C atoms is available for energy release to increase ATP:AMP ratio
        
        When ATP:AMP ratio increases, there is a high energy charge, which inhibits activity of PFK1, less C atoms flow via the glycolytic pathway, less energy release as energy might be in excess
