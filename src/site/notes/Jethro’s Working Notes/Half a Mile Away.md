# Half a Mile Away

### Lyrics

Little Geo is a friend of mine

We get some money and we buy a cheap wine

Sit on the corner and have a holiday

Hide the bottle when the cop goes by

Talk about women and lie, lie, lie

Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away

Wait for mama to turn out the light

Crawl on the the roof and then hit the night

I should be sleeping, but tonight I just can't stay

I've given everybody so much time

Now I need a moment that's mine

Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away

Angelina save a place for me

I've been living someone else's life, and now I've got to be free

Turn your transistor on and let the music play

I try to keep the family satisfied

But there's gotta be more to life than just try, try, try

Oh, my other world is only half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away

It's just a half a mile away

I've given everybody so much time

Now I need a moment that's mine

Oh, my other world is just a half a mile away
