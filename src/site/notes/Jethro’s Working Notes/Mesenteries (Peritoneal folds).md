### Mesenteries as Peritoneal folds

Mesenteries are peritoneal folds that connect abdominal viscera to each other or to the abdominal wall (*Mesenteries are peritoneal formations that suspend the abdominal viscera in the abdominal cavity*). They are derived from the dorsal mesentery and ventral mesentery during embryonic development.

- **There are three types of mesenteries:**
    - Mesenteries
        
        Mesenteries are peritoneal folds that attach to the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior abdominal wall\|Posterior abdominal wall]].
        
        e.g. Mesentery of the small intestine, Transverse mesocolon, Sigmoid mesocolon
        
    - Ligaments
        
        Ligaments are peritoneal folds that connect two organs together.
        
        e.g. Splenorenal ligament, Gastrophrenic ligament
        
    - Omentum
        
        Omentum are two folds of omentum that passes from the stomach and first part of the duodenum to other viscera.
        
        e.g. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Greater omentum\|Greater omentum]] , [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Lesser omentum\|Lesser omentum]]

- **Mesenteries serve the below functions:**
    1. To suspend the abdominal viscera in the abdominal cavity
    2. To convey neurovascular structures and ducts to and away from the viscera
