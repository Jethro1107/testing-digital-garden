### Palmar aponeurosis

The palmar aponeurosis is a triangular deep fascia on the palm that anchors to the skin.

It consist of 2 types of fibres:

- Longitudinal fibres run in the longitudinal axis of the hand, and extends to the digits.
- Transverse fibres interconnect the longitudinal fibres.

The apex of the palmar aponeurosis is continuous with the tendon of the palmaris longus if present, otherwise, it anchors to the flexor retinaculum (roof of the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Carpal tunnel\|Carpal tunnel]]).
