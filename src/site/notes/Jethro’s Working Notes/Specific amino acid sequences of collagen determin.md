### Specific amino acid sequences of collagen determines its helical structure

When considering the amino acid sequences of alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains of collagen, there are two features: 1) ***************Gly-X-Y repeat***************, and 2) ***************Abundant proline and lysine.***************

- ****************************Gly-X-Y repeat****************************
    
    Alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains are characterised with a Gly-X-Y repeat, i.e. they have glycine every 3 amino acid residues.
    
    Glycine, being the smallest amino acid, enables the turn of the helical structure, and is thus important for helical folding from C-terminal to N-terminal. Hence, [[Glycine mutations underlie the pathogenesis of Type II Osteogenesis Imperfecta\|Glycine mutations underlie the pathogenesis of Type II Osteogenesis Imperfecta]].
    
- ******************************************************Abundant proline and lysine******************************************************
    
    Proline and lysine residues can be hydroxylated, where:
    
    - Hydroxylation of proline enables formation of intramolecular H bonds, promoting helical stability.
    - Hydroxylation of lysine enables intermolecular cross-link formation, maintaining fibril stability.
