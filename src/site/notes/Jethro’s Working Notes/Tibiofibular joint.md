### Tibiofibular joint

- **Superior tibiofibular joint**
    
    The superior tibiofibular joint is the articulation between the head of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femur\|Femur]]  and the lateral condyle of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tibia\|Tibia]] .
    
    It is classified as a synovial plane joint, but gliding movements is limited by the anterior and posterior ligaments of the head of the fibia.

**The interosseous border of the tibia and fibula are connected by interosseous membrane.**

- **Inferior tibiofibular joint**
    
    The inferior tibiofibular joint is a fibrous joint, or a syndesmosis. It consist of a fibrous structure that enables the distal ends of the tibia and fibula to form a notch-like structure for the insertion of the tallus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot\|Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot]]), forming a stable [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ankle joint\|Ankle joint]].
