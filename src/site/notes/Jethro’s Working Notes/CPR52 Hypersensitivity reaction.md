### Hypersensitivity reactions

- **Helper T cell subtypes, cytokines produced and function**
    
    Th1 (TNF-alpha, IL-2, LT) - responsible for viral and intracellular bacteria infections
    
    Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) - responsible for extracellular parasitic infections
    
    Th17 (IL-17) - Responsible for extracellular bacteria infections
    
    Treg (IL-10) - responsible for immune tolerance, lymphocyte homeostasis and regulating immune response
    
- **What is the nature of hypersensitivity reactions?**
    
    Antigen-driven, immune-mediated immune process, but exagerated in response magnitude or inappropriate form
    
    It can cause host tissue dammage and can be life threatening
    

### Type I hypersensitivity reactions

- **Other name for type I hypersensitivity**
    
    Immediate hypersensitivity (Allergy and Anaphylaxis)
    
- **Mediator and effector of type I hypersensitivity reactions**
    
    Mediator: IgE
    
    Effector: Mast cells
    
    - **Features of mast cells and their location**
        
        Mast cells consist of numerous pre-produced granules consisting of histamine, heparin, serotonin and protease
        
        Mast cells express high-affinity receptors for Fc region of IgE
        
        Mast cells can be found in areas exposed to external environment to capture allergens, i.e. skin, mucosa of respiratory tract, digestive tract, conjunctiva
        
    - **Signalling pathway for mast cell activation**
        
        When IgE binds to receptors for Fc region of IgE on mast cells
        
        This results in cross-linking of IgE receptors on mast cells, resulting in recruitment of tyrosine kinases, eventually resulting in increased Ca2+ influx
        
        Ca2+ influx triggers cytoskeleton rearrangement, resulting in degranulation
        
        It also activates arachidonic acid metabolism, resulting in production of lipid mediators
        
        It also results in transcriptional activation of cytokine genes

    - **Effects of mast cell activation**
        1. Degranulation of granules (Histamine, serotonin i.e. vasoactive amines and protease)
            
            Histamine and serotonin - stimulates vasodilation and smooth muscle contraction (bronchoconstriction), glandular secretion and increased vascular permeability
            
            Protease - cause proteolysis and tissue damage
            
        2. Activated arachidonic acid metabolism (prostaglandins, leukotrienes)
            
            Lipid mediators - trigger vasodilation and smooth muscle contraction
            
        3. Transcriptional activation of cytokine genes and secretion of cytokines
            
            TNF, IL-1, IL-8 for mediating inflammation and recruitment of leukocytes

        - **Pathogenesis of SLE**
            
            Production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies results in lose of immune tolerence

### Type IV hypersensitivity reactions

- **Other name for type IV hypersensitivity**
    
    Delayed-type hypersensitivity
    
    - **Why is type IV hypersensitivity ‘delayed’?**
        
        Relative to Type I hypersensitivity which occurs immediately after exposure, the response occurs 1-2 days after antigen exposure
        
- **Mediators and effectors of type IV hypersensitivity reactions**
    
    Mediator: Th1
    
    Effector: Cell-mediated inflammation by macrophages and CD8+ T cells
    
    - **Mechanism of sensitization and activation in type IV hypersensitivity reactions**
        
        Sensitization phase:
        
        Antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) present the antigen to helper T cells, releasing IL-12 to cause differentiation into Th1 phenotype
        
        Activation phase:
        
        Th1 arrives at site of allergens, releasing critical cytokines such as IFN-gamma, resulting in the activation of macrophages and CD8+ T cells
        
        Activation of macrophages results in increased MHC class II protein expression, increased phagolysosome formation, Increased NO synthase activation and increased ROS formed

- **Examples of Type IV hypersensitivity reactions**
    - Allergic contact dermititis
        - **Common allergens of contact dermititis**
            
            Poison ivy, latex, detergent, nickel
            
        - **Pathogenesis of allergic contact dermititis**
            
            Antigen presenting cells present the antigen to helper T cells, releasing IL-12 that results in activation of Th1
            
            Th1 moves to site of allergen, releasing INF-gamma resulting in macrophage activation, releasing TNF-alpha
            
            TNF-alpha activates CD8+ T cells, mediating cytotoxicity
            
            The overall effect results in inflammation, thus resulting in local edema and erythrema
            
    - Granulomatous hypersensitivity
        - **Pathogenesis of TB granulomatous inflammation**
            
            MTB infiltrate alveolar macrophages, but are not degraded by phagolysosome
            
            Dendritic cells present MTB antigen to helper T cells, releasing IL-12, resulting in differentiation into Th1 phenotype
            
            Th1, along with other immune cells (plasma cells, CD8+ T cells) reach to site of infection
            
            Th1 release INF-gamma, causing activation of macrophages, which is enabled to kill intracellular MTB to contain the infection
            
            MTB infected macrophages also continue to present antigen to Th-1, resulting in chronic inflammation and formation of granuloma
            
            Granuloma prevents dissemination of MTB and enables immune cells to contain the infection
