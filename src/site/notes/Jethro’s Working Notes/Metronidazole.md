- **MOA of metronidazole**
    
    Metronidazole is chemically reduced by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), which can only be found in anaerobic organisms. 
    
    The resulting metabolite binds to DNA to disrupt the helical structure, causing DNA break. This inhibits DNA synthesis.
    
- **Adverse effects of metronidazole**
    
    Side effects include:
    
    - GI disturbance (nausea, vomiting)
    - Metallic taste
    - Occasionally causes alcohol intolerance, seizures and sensory neuropathy
- **Resistance to metronidazole**
