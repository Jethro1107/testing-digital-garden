### **What is IGA nephropathy?**

IgA nephropathy is an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis and is the most common cause of reccurent hematuria worldwide

### **Epidemiology of IGA nephropathy**

Most common glomerular disease revealed by renal biopsies worldwide

Particularly a high prevelance of in Asia

Wide range of age presentation

### **Clinical manifestation of IGA nephropathy**

Clinically manifests as:

Often a nephritic picture - gross/ microscopic hematuria

Proteinuria - 10% in nephrotic range

Acute kidney injury

Chronic kidney injury

### **Pathogenesis of IGA nephropathy**

### **Glomerular pathology of IGA nephropathy**

Light microscopy - Mesangial proliferation (>3 cells in messangium)

### **Treatment of IGA nephropathy**

Depends on clinical setting

Corticosteroids required if massive proteinuria or rapidly progressive kidney injury

### **Outcome of IGA nephropathy**

Slow progression to CKD in 15-40% patients within 20 years

Can reccur after kidney transplant
