### Fibula

The fibula forms part of the bony framework of the leg. It occupies the lateral position with respect to the larger [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tibia\|Tibia]]. It does not partake in the knee joint and in any weight bearing activity.

The proximal end of the fibula consist of the head and the neck. The shaft of the fibula is narrow, as it is not weight bearing.

- **Distal end of the fibula**
    
    The distal end of the fibula, on the lateral side forms a projection that extends distally called the lateral malleolus (forming the lateral side of the ankle). The lateral malleolus articulates with the lateral side of the tallus, the medial large tarsal bone, which forms part of the ankle joint.
