### Absorption of carbohydrates is mediated by by Na+-dependent transport and facilitated diffusion

Glucose and galactose absorption is mediated by Na+-dependent cotransport mechanisms, while fructose absorption is mediated by facilitated diffusion.

- **On the apical membrane:**
    
    SGLT1 (Sodium-glucose linked transporter 1) co-transport Na+ with glucose and galactose down the Na+ gradient generated by Na+/K+ ATPase on the basolateral membrane.
    
    GLUT5 transports fructose from the intestinal lumen into the cytosol of the enterocyte.
    
- **On the basolateral membrane:**
    
    GLUT2 transports glucose, fructose and galactose into circulation.
    
    GLUT5 transports fructose into circulation.
