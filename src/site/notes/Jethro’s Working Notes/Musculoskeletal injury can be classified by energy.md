### Musculoskeletal injury can be classified by energy

Musculoskeletal injury can be classified into high energy injury or low energy injury.

High energy injury is usually associated with high energy causes, such as road traffic accidents, and industrial accidents.

They cause massive tissue injury, with high mortality.

- Soft tissue injury and skeletal injury (usually communicated fractures or transverse fractures) is common.

Prevention is key.

Low energy is usually associated with low energy cause, such as falls.

They cause localised tissue injury.

They can also have high mortality, especially in older people.

Prevention is relatively difficult as it relates to normal daily activities.
