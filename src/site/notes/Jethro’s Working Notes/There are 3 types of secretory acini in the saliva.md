### **There are 3 types of secretory acini**

Mucous acini:

Histologically, mucous acini cells assume the histological appearance of mucin secreting cells, with a pale-staining (clear) apical cytoplasm (due to the presence of pale-staining mucinogen granules) and a flattened nuclei at the base.

They are involved in mucus secretion (thick and slimy).

Serous acini:

Histologically, serous acini assume the histological appearance of protein-secreting cells, with a basophilic basal region (due to abundance of rER in the region) and a eosinophilic apical region (due to abundance of scretory vesicles) and a round nucleus.

They release secretions that are rich in proteins and enzymes (watery in texture).

Serous demilunes:

Serous demilunes are mixed glands containing both serous and mucous cells. There is a serous cap, superficial to mucous cells.
