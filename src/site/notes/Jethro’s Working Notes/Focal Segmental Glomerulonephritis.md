### **What is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis?**

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is characterised by by sclerosis of some (but not all) glomeruli that involves only part of each affected glomerulus

### **Cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis**

Idiopathic

Secondary:

HIV infection, Obesity, hypertension, or maladaptation to nephron loss

### **Glomerular pathology of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis**

Light microscopy - Focal and segmental hyalinosis and sclerosis:

Replacement of capillary loops with accelular amorphous material derived from plasma protein, collagen or basement membrane material

![[Untitled\|Untitled]]

Immunofluorescence microscopy - negative

Electron microscopy - effacement of foot processes with no deposits

### **Treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis**

Usually little response to steroid therapy

### **Outcome of focal segmental glomerulonephritis**

Likely progression into renal failure

Recurrence in 25-50% after transplant
