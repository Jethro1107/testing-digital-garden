### Selective COX-2 inhibitors
- ****************************************************************************Examples of Selective COX-2 inhibitors***************************************************************************
    Celecoxib, Rofecoxib, Etoricoxib

Similar to traditional [[Jethro’s Working Notes/NSAID\|NSAID]] , selective COX-2 inhibitors have a similar MOA to achieve anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects.

- ******************************************************Before understanding the rational for using selective COX-2 inhibitors, a comparison between COX-1 and COX-2 activity is to be made******************************************************
    
    COX-1 is constituitively active in many tissues, mainly in the GI tract ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Prostaglandin regulates gastrointestinal functions in the stomach\|Prostaglandin regulates gastrointestinal functions in the stomach]]), in platelets, and in the kidneys. Hence, traditional NSAID with high COX-1 selectivity may result in GI disturbances, Renal insufficiency and risk of bleeding.
    
    COX-2 is inducible in inflammatory sites. Hence, there may be a lower risk to *gastrointestinal complications*. However, COX-2 is constituitively active in the kidneys as well, such that it still can precipitate renal insufficiency. Furthermore, it is also associated with cardiovascular thrombotic events.
