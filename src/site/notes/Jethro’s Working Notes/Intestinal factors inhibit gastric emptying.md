### Intestinal factors inhibit gastric emptying

Intestinal factors, to a larger extent, inhibit [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastric emptying\|Gastric emptying]], such that gastric emptying occurs at a rate suitable for proper digestion and absorption by the small intestine.

- ************************************************************************************************Neural and hormonal intestinal factors regulate gastric emptying************************************************************************************************
    1. *****************************Duodenal enterogastric reflex***************************** *inhibits gastric emptying.*
        
        There are 2 pathways involved in the duodenal enterogastric reflex:
        
        - Local enteric reflex involving the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]]
        - Long vagovagal feedback
        
        The two feedbacks inhibit the pyloric pump, and increase the tone of the pyloric sphincter, thus inhibiting gastric emptying.
        
        The enterogastric reflex is activated by:
        
        - Distension of the duodenum
        - Acidity of the chyme
        - Irritation of the duodenal mucosa
        - Hyper- or hypo-osmotic chyme
        - Presence of partially digested proteins in the chyme (and to a smaller extent, presence of fats)
        
        It makes sense that these factors activate the enterogastric feedback:
        
        - Excessive gastric emptying results in distension of the duodenum, hence activation of the enterogastric reflex inhibits gastric emptying to prevent having too much chyme in the intestines.
        - When acidity of duodenal chyme falls too low, the enterogastric reflex temporarily inhibits gastric emptying to prevent further emptying of acidic chyme. This provides sufficient time for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pancreatic secretions\|Pancreatic secretions]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biliary secretion\|Biliary secretion]] to neutralise the acidic chyme.
        - Presence of partially digested proteins, the enterogastric reflex temporarily inhibits gastric emptying to provide sufficient time for digestion.
        - Presence of hyperosmotic or hypoosmotic chyme elicit the enterogastric reflex to inhibit gastric emptying, thus preventing fluid and electrolyte balance after intestinal absorption.
    2. *****************Hormonal factors, particularly cholecystokinin inhibit gastric emptying.*****************
        
        Under the presence of fatty chyme, cholecystokinin is released by I cells in the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa.
        
        Via circulation, it reaches the stomach and inhibits the pyloric pump and increase the tone of pyloric sphincter, thus inhibiting gastric emptying.
        
        This provides sufficient time for the digestion of fats (especially when fat digestion is relatively slower).
