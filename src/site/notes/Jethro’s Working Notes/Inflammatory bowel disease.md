### Inflammatory bowel disease

- **What is inflammatory bowel disease?**
    
    Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small and/or large bowel.
    
    It is idiosyncratic by definition, but thought to be resulting from complex interactions between gut microbiota and host immunity in genetically predisposed individuals, resulting in abnormal mucosal immune activation.
    
    There are two clinical entities that comprise of inflammatory bowel disease: 1) Crohn’s disease and 2) Ulcerative colitis. [[The distinction between Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative colitis is primarily based on morphology\|The distinction between Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative colitis is primarily based on morphology]].

    - Abdominal pain
    - Diarrhoea
    - Weight loss
    - Malaise, anorexia, fever
    - Extra-intestinal manifestations (inflammation is not isolated in the bowel):
        - eyes: Uveitis
        - Joints: Arthritis
        - Spine: Ankylosing Spondylitis
        - Liver and bile duct: Sclerosing cholangitis
    
    Ulcerative colitis

    - **Bloody diarrhoea with mucus**
    - Lower abdominal pain
    - Malaise, anorexia (less severe compared to Crohn’s disease)
    - Similar extraintestinal manifestations to Crohn’s disease
- **Complications of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis**
    
    Crohn’s disease
    
    - Strictures - resulting in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intestinal obstruction\|Intestinal obstruction]]
    - Fissures - resulting in perforation and fistula formation
    - Increased risk of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Colorectal carcinoma\|Colorectal carcinoma]]
    
    Ulcerative colitis
    
    - Toxic megacolon - severely dilated colon filled with gas, with impending perforation
