### The 3 phases of pancreatic secretion and their stimulatory mechanisms

Regulation of pancreatic secretion in the cephalic and gastric phase follows the same mechanism as in gastric secretion ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/The 3 phases of gastric secretion\|The 3 phases of gastric secretion]]).

- **In the cephalic phase:**
    
    Signals originate from the sight, smell, taste, thought of food, which stimulates the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex then stimulates the appetite centre, which then stimulate the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) and dorsal motor nucleus of vagal nerve (DMX). This stimulates the vagal efferents to release acetylcholine.
    
- **In the gastric phase:**
    
    The same long vagovagal reflex triggered by the distension of the stomach triggers the vagal efferent to release acetylcholine.
    
- **Stimulation in the cephalic phase and gastric phase results in:**
    
    Stimulation in the cephalic phase and gastric phase results in enzymatic secretion by acinar cells, as acetylcholine stimulates acinar cells more than ductal cells. Lack of ductal cell simulation leads to insufficient fluid secretion. Hence, little enzymes actually reach the duodenal lumen ([[Functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells\|Functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells]]).
    

In the intestinal phase, pancreatic secretion is mediated by the release of secretin and cholecystokinin. [[Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase\|Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase]].
