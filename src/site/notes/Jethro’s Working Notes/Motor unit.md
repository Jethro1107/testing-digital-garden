### Motor unit

Motor unit refers to the collection of muscle fibres that is innervated by a single motor neuron.

Muscles fibres of the same motor units are not bundled together within a muscle, but tend to spread evenly within a muscles, such that the force applied to the tendon is balanced regardless of which motor unit is stimulated.

    Motor units of occular muscles or other delicate muscles (e.g. those of our digits), control fewer muscle fibres than big muscles (e.g. biceps).
