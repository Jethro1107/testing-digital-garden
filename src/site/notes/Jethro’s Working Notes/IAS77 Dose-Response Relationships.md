### Introduction

- What is pharmacodynamics? What is pharmacokinetics?
    
    Pharmacodynamics (PD) - The study of the magnitude of dose response, in relations to concentration of a drug at the site of action (The study of the effects of the drug on the biological system)
    
    Pharmacokinetics (PK) - The study of drug movements into, round and out of the body, particularly in the process of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (The study of the effects of the biological system on the drug)
    
- Describe the principle of drug action.
    
    Drugs do not create new physiological functions
    
    Drugs bind to the receptors and alter the physiological function of the receptor
    
- What are the possible effects of drugs?
    
    Stimulation
    
    Repression
    
    Irritation
    
    Replacement
    
    Cytotoxic agents
    
- What are the factors affecting the drug response?
    
    By receptor occupancy theory, a response is produced by binding of the drug to the receptor to form a drug-receptor complex
    
    Hence, number of drug-receptor complex formed affects the response, which equals to occupancy times total receptor number
    
    Other than drug-receptor complex, efficacy defines the power of drug binding to a receptor to induce a response
    
    Response is thus a function of occupancy, efficacy of receptor, and receptor number

- What is potency? What are the factors controlling potency?
    
    Potency refers to the concentration of the drug to produce a given effect
    
    Clinically, the 'given effect' refers to 50% of maximum effect, and the concentration to produce such effect (potency) is known as EC50
    
    A drug is more potent if it requires a lower concentration of drug to produce the same effect
    
    Potency is controlled by:
    
    Biological system - Receptor density/number of receptors, and efficiency of stimulation-response mechanism, and amplification properties of cells
    
    Drug - Affinity and efficacy of the drug with its receptor
    
- What is efficacy?
    
    Efficacy refers to the maximum effect of an egonist if the dose is taken at the highest tolerable dose (Emax)
    
    A drug has higher efficacy if it produces a greatest response at the same concentration
    

### Agonism and Antagonism

- What is affinity?
    
    Affinity is the attraction of the drug for a receptor
    
    The bests drugs are the ones that have a high affinity for their target receptor to initiate a beneficial effect, and little or no affinity for receptors so they can have as few unwanted effects as possible
    
    Both agonist and antagonist have affinity
    
- What is efficacy?
    
    Efficacy refers to the effect of the drug
    
    If a drug binds to the receptor and has no effect, it has an efficacy of 0
    
    If a drug binds to a receptor, and at highest tolerable concentration has the same maximal effect as the endogenous ligand, it has an efficacy of 1.
    
    Agonist tends to have efficacy, but antagonist have 0 efficacy
    
- What are the different states of a receptor?
    
    Active state and inactive state
    
    In the absence of drugs equilibrium between active state and inactive state constitutes the constitutive activity
    
- What is a ligand?
    
    Ligand is any molecule that attaches selectively to a particular site
    
- What is an agonist?
    
    Agonist is an agent that activates the receptor to produce an effect similar to the endogenous ligand (similar efficacy)

- What is an antagonist?
    
    Antagonist is an agent that prevents the action of an agonist on a receptor or the subsequent response, but does not have effect on its own
    
- What is a partial agonist?
    
    Partial agonist is an agent that activates a receptor to produce submaximal effect 
    
    In presence of an agonist, a partial agonist acts as an inhibitor by occupying the receptors to prevent binding of full agonist
    
- What is an inverse agonist?
    
    Inverse agonist is an agent that activates a receptor to produce an effect in the opposite direction to that of the agonist
    
- How do inverse agonist produce opposite effects?
    
    Inverse agonist has a higher affinity to receptors in ianctive state, thus abolishing the constitutive activity
    

### Reversibility and Competition of Interaction

- How can binding of drug be classified?
    
    Drug binding can be classified into:
    
    Specific - Drug exerts effect on a single receptor
    
    Non-specific - Drug affects all receptors in the same way, often involving denaturation of protein proportion of the receptor and is thus often irreversible
    
    Specific binding can also be classified into reversible and non reversible binding
    
    Reversible - Characterised by a rapid dissociation of drug-receptor complex (High Kd)
    
    Non-reversible - Characterised by slow dissociation of drug-receptor complex (low Kd), not a good drug, unless it acts on foreign cells like bacterial cells and cancer cells
    
    Specific, reversible binding can be further classified into competitive and non-competitive binding:
    
    Competitive - Drugs and endogenous ligand cannot bind simultaneously as drug binds to the same site of endogenous ligand due to similar chemical structure, preventing the binding of endogenous ligand to the same site
    
     Can overcome inhibition by increasing the concentration of endogenous ligand
    
    Non-competitive - Drug and ligand can bind simultaneously to a receptor at different binding site, but the drug is often a negative allosteric modulator that modulates efficacy
    
    Cannot overcome inhibition by increasing concentration of endogenous ligand
    
- Give 2 examples of atypical binding.
    
    Non-classical competition - Drug and endogenous ligand bind to the different sites but cannot bind simultaneously as binding of one to receptor causes a conformational change to prevent binding of the other
    
    Uncompetitive binding - Drug initially cannot bind to receptor due to non-compatible conformation, but once ligand binds to receptor, it causes a conformational change of drug binding site and thus allows the binding to the receptor 
    
- What is desensitization?
    
    Desensitization (Refractoriness) is the condition in which continued stimulation of cell with agonist results in the diminished effect upon subsequent stimulation of cell with agonist
    
    Removal of the agonist for extended period allows the cell to reset capacity to response
    
- What are the two types of desensitization?
    
    Homologous desensitization is caused by attenuation of the stimulated receptor (can switch to drug that stimulate different receptor of the same pathway)
    
    Heterologous desensitization is caused by the attenuation of all receptors that share a common signalling pathway (switch to drug with a completely different pathway)
    
- What is therapeutic index?
    
    Therapeutic index refers to the ratio of the dose that causes toxic effect in 50% of the population and the dose that causes effective effect in 50% of the population, i.e. TD50/ED50
    
    The greater the therapeutic index, the greater the therapeutic window (The range of concentration safe for the patient)
