### Histology of the oesophagus

The oesophagus also poccess [[Jethro’s Working Notes/The common histological layers of the GI tract\|The common histological layers of the GI tract]], namely the 1) Mucosa, 2) submucosa, 3) Muscularis externa and 4) Serosa/Adventitia.

- **Features of the mucosa of the oesophagus**
    
    The oesophagus is lined with a non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium, which provides protection against abraision when delivering the bolus down the oesophagus.
    
    There is nothing distinct about the lamina propria and the muscularis mucosae in the oesophagus.

- **Features of the submucosa of the oesophagus**
    
    The oesophagus is one of 2 regions of the GI tract to poccess submucosal glands, the other being the duodenum.
    
    The submucosal glands of the oesophagus (oesophageal glands) that are responsible for mucus secretion.

    Oesophageal glands consist of a clear cytoplasm and a flatteneed nuclei, indicating it being a mucous gland ([[IAS27  Epithelial and Glandular Tissues \|IAS27  Epithelial and Glandular Tissues ]]).
    
- **Features of the muscularis externa of the oesophagus**
    
    Different segments of the muscularis externa of the oesophagus consist of different muscle types:
    
    - The upper 1/3 - is made of pure skeletal muscles
    - The middle 1/3 - consist of a mix of skeletal muscles and smooth muscles
    - The lower 1/3 - is made of pure smooth muscles
    
    ![[ICM  Spindle-shaped smooth muscles with central nucleus at the top, and Elongated skeletal muscles with peripherally-located nucleus\|ICM  Spindle-shaped smooth muscles with central nucleus at the top, and Elongated skeletal muscles with peripherally-located nucleus]]
    
    ICM: Spindle-shaped smooth muscles with central nucleus at the top, and Elongated skeletal muscles with peripherally-located nucleus
    
    ![[OLM  This histological slide shows skeletal muscles, which can be recognised by the peripherally located nucleus.\|OLM  This histological slide shows skeletal muscles, which can be recognised by the peripherally located nucleus.]]
    
    OLM: This histological slide shows skeletal muscles, which can be recognised by the peripherally located nucleus.
    
    Note that 2 sublayers can still be seen in the oesophagus, with the myenteric plexus in between the two.

    Neurons can be seen as large basophilic cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli.
    
- **Features of the serosa/adventita of the oesophagus**
    
    The oesophagus is mainly surrounded by adventitia, which is continuous with other tissue in the mediastinum.
    
    Only the distal part of the oesophagus (after entering the abdominal cavity via the oesophageal hiatus) is lined with serosa.
