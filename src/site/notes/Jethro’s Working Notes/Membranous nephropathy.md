### **What is membranous nephropathy?**

Membranous nephropathy is an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis characterised by subepithelial deposits along the glomerular basement membrane

### **Epidemiology of membranous nephropathy**

Usually occurs in 30-50 years old and follows an indolent and slowly progressive course

### **Causes of membranous nephropathy**

Primary membranous nephropathy (**70%**):

Autoantibodies against podocyte M-type phospholipase A2 receptors (PLA2R)

Secondary membranous nephropathy:

Antibodies against planted exogenous antigens (e.g. Hepatitis B and C)

Malignancies

Autoimmune diseases - SLE, rheumatoid arthritis

Drugs (especially NSAID)

Sarcoidosis

### **Pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy**

Membranous nephropathy is a form of chronic immune complex glomerulonephritis mediated by antibodies reacting in situ with endogenous (PLA2R) or planted glomerular antigens, resulting in subepithelial immune complex deposits

Immune complex deposits results in complement activation on podocytes and formation of membrane attacking complex

This results in podocyte injury and proteinuria

### **Glomerular pathology in membranous nephropathy**

Light microscopy - Diffuse thickening of capillary wall on routine H&E staining and subendothelial spike formation on silver stain

### **Treatment of membranous nephropathy**

NSAID for treating primary membranous nephropathy

Treatment of secondary cause of membranous nephropathy

### **Outcome of membranous nephropathy**

60% of patients have persistent proteinuria

10% of patients progress into renal failure within 10 years
