### Intervertebral disc

Intervertebral disc is a fibrocartilage pad between 2 adjacent *****************vertebral bodies***************** from C2 to the sacrum (there is no IV disc between C1 and C2).

Structurally, the intervertebral disc consist of the outer annulus fibrosis and the inner nucleus pulposus.

- ******************************Annulus fibrosis******************************
    
    The annulus fibrosis consist of concentric lamellae of fibrocartilage surrounding the core of nucleus pulposus.
    
    The fibres run obliquely from one vertebral body to another, which limits lateral rotation of vertebral bodies.

- ********************************Nucleus pulposus********************************
    
    The nucleus pulposus serves as the core of the intervertebral disc.
    
    It mainly consist of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cartilage matrix\|Cartilage matrix]], which consist of hydrated collagen-proteoglycan gel (mainly hyaluronic-aggrecan matrix, see [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans\|Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans]]).
    
    This provides compressive resistance, enabling it to serve as a shock absorber for vertical forces.
    
    It also permits some degree of movement between adjacent vertebrae.
