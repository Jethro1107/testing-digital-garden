### Agents that promote gastric mucosal defense

### Sucralfate

- **MOA of sucralfate**
    
    Sucralfate is a complex of sucrose sulphate and aluminium hydroxide.
    
    Upon contact with gastric acid, aluminium is released, resulting in a negative charge in the remaining compound.
    
    The remaining compound complexes with glycoprotein in the mucous gel layer, resulting in formation of a viscous gel that adheres to the epithelial cells of the stomach, including area of ulceration.
    
    This protects the stomach surface from being degraded by acid and pepsin.
    
- **Adverse effects of sucralfate**
    
    Sucralfate is generally well tolerated as it is not absorbed and is devoid of systemic effects.
    
    It may cause constipation due to the aluminium salt.
    
- **Drug interactions of sucralfate**
    
    Sucralfate is activated in an acidic environment, hence concomitant administration with [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Antacids\|Antacids]] will reduce its efficiency.
    
    It may bind to several drugs (e.g. quinolone, phenytoin and warfarin), limiting their absorption.
    
    It may bind to proteins in food, reducing its efficacy. Hence, *sucralfate is taken on an empty stomach*. 
    

### Bismuth

- **MOA of bismuth**
    
    Bismuth binds to glycoprotein in the mucous gel layer, resulting in the formation of a viscous gel that adheres to the epithelial cells of the stomach, including area of ulceration.
    
    This protects the stomach surface from being degraded by acid and pepsin.
    
    It also stimulates the secretion of mucus, bicarbonate and prostaglandins.
    
    It also has direct microbial activity against [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Helicobacter pylori\|Helicobacter pylori]].
    
- **Adverse effects of bismuth**
    
    Side effects of bismuth include:
    
    - Darkening of teeth and tongue
    - Darkening of stool - This is a problem as a complication of peptic ulcer is melena. Patients may confuse it with worsening of GI bleed and stop taking the drug.
    - Prolonged use of bismuth in patient with renal failure can cause encephalopathy (ataxia, headache, confusion and seizures)
    - Bismuth may bind to protein in bood, reducing its efficacy. Hence, *bismuth is taken on an empty stomach*.

### Misoprostol

- **MOA of misoprostol**
    
    Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analogue, and has 3 roles in treating peptic ulcers:
    
    1. It binds to PGE1 receptors on parietal cells, reducing cAMP levels. This prevents activation of H+/K+ ATPase, thus *reducing acid secretion*.
    2. It stimulates mucus and bicarbonate secretion by surface and neck mucous cells.
    3. It serves as a vasodilator and increases blood flow, facilitating healing.

- **Adverse effects of misoprostol**
    
    GI discomfort - cramps and diarrhoea (as misoprostol increases gut motility).
    
    **Misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnancy as it stimulates uterine contractions.**
