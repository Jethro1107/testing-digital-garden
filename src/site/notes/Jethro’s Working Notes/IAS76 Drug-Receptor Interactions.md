### Mechanism of Drug Action

- Describe the Mechanism of drug action.
    
    A drug interacts with macromolecular component of the organism, thus altering the function of the component, resulting in physiological changes
    
    It does not create new physiological functions
    
    The macromolecule is almost always a protein - Enzymes, ion channels, transporters, receptors
    
- How may drugs target enzymes?
    
    Drugs may bind to enzymes to increase or decrease activity
    
    In clinical use, drugs that stimulate enzyme activity is rare, as enzyme activity is often limited by substrate concentration
    
    Hence to increase activity, the common treatment is to provide the substrate
    
    In clinical use, most drugs that target enzymes are enzyme inhibitors
    
    Enzyme inhibitors tend to work by binding to the active site
    
    Chemical deficiencies can be corrected by inhibiting an enzyme that uses the chemical as a substrate
    
- Give an example of a drug targeting an enzyme.
    
    Seizures are usually caused by deficiency of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
    
    GABA is degraded by GABA-transaminase
    
    Hence, GABA-transaminase inhibitors like Valproate and Vigabatrin act as anticonvulsants
    
    Vigabatrin has a similar chemical structure as gamma-aminobutyric acid, thus occupy the binding site of of GABA-transaminase to prevent the depletion of GABA
    
- How may drugs target ion channels?
    
    Drugs may be specific for a species of ion channels
    
    Drugs may bind to binding sites on ion channels and inhibit or enhance the movement of ions, thus altering the physiological function of the ion channels
    
- Give an example of a drug targeting an ion channel.
    
    Lidocaine (pain killer)
    
    During tissue damage, the sensory nerve is stimulated and generates and conducts and action potential to the brain, resulting in the sensation of pain
    
    Depolarization phase in action potential is due to influx of Na+ via Na+ channels
    
    Lidocaine act as Na+ blockers, depolarization cannot occur, and thus action potential is not generated, thus stopping pain
    
- How may drugs target transporters?
    
    Transporters transport drugs and endogenous compounds across the membrane
    
    Transporters are involved in pharmacokinetics (in absorption), and pharmacodynamics
    
    In pharmacokinetics, drugs must be able to make use of transporters to transport across the membrane, this is by having a similar structure with the endogenous compound the transporter transports
    
    In pharmacodynamics, drugs may serve as an inhibitor of the transporter. It binds to the transporter by is not transported, thus preventing the transport of the endogenous compound
    
- Give an example of a drug targeting a transporter.
    
    Serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors - Fluoxetine (Prozac)
    
    Serotonin stimulates Serotonin receptors to produce its effect
    
    Serotonin has a short half life. After stimulation, it is inactivated and is transported back to the presynaptic neuron by Serotonin Transporters (SERT)
    
    Serotonin must be inactivated before re-uptake
    
    Fluoxetine (Prozac) inhibits inactivation of serotonin, such that it prevents the re-uptake of serotonin, thus causing accumulation of serotonin and increased stimulates of Serotonin receptors, causing increased effects
    
- How may drugs target receptors?
    
    Drugs do not usually directly bind to enzymes, ion channels or transporters, but bind to receptors as mediators
    
    There are many receptors for endogenous compounds like hormones (Endocrine, Autocrine, Paracrine), growth factors, neurotransmitters
    
    A drug can mimic the action of such endogenous compounds by binding to the receptor
    

### Receptors

- What are the different domains of a receptor? How do they interact with one another?
    
    Ligand binding/Recognition domain - For binding of endogenous molecule or drug
    
    Effector/Transduction domain - Undergoes functional conformation changes, converting signal into response
    
    Binding of ligand to ligand binding domain induces conformational change in the effector domain
    
- How does property of the drug affect its interaction with a receptor?
    
    Hydrophilic drugs bind to receptors in the hydrophilic domain of the receptor, which is on cell surface
    
    Lipophilic drugs can bind to lipophilic domain of the receptor, which is buried in the transmembrane region
    
- How can receptors be classified?
    
    Physiological receptor - Receptors with known endogenous ligand
    
    True drug receptor - Receptors with no known endogenous ligand, in which all known ligands are drugs e.g. Benzodiazepines receptor
    
- Does an effector molecule be only linked to one receptor?
    
    No, it may be controlled by multiple receptors
    
- What are the different types of effector molecules of receptors?
    
    Receptor-linked enzymes, Receptor-linked ion channels, G-proteins, Transcription factors
    
- What are the common receptor-linked enzymes?
    
    Protein Kinases, Protein Phosphatase and Cyclase
    
    Protein Kinase is the most common type
    
- Describe the structure and function of receptor-linked protein kinase and its function.
    
    Consist of a ligand binding domain (outer surface of membrane) - Binds to ligand
    
    Single membrane-spanning element (transmembrane region) - connects ligand binding domain to protein kinase domain
    
    Protein kinase domain (inner surface of membrane) - Phosphorylate tyrosine residues on  effector proteins in the inner surface of membrane
    
- What is another name for receptor-linked ion channels? How does it function?
    
    Ligand gated ion channel
    
    Ligand bind to the receptor, which may induce opening of the receptor-linked ion channel
    
    This may alter the membrane potential and ionic composition
    
- Give examples of receptors that are linked to ion channels.
    
    Nicotinic cholinergic receptors
    
    GABA receptors
    
- What is G-protein coupled receptor? What is G protein? What are their functions?
    
    G-protein couple receptors is a receptor made of 7 alpha-helix
    
    G protein is a GTP bound protein which activates adenyl cyclase, PLC, and Calcium and potassium channels
    
    GPCR acts as a ligand binding region, G Protein transduces signal to effector proteins
    
- What are nuclear receptors?
    
    They are transcription factors, present in the cytosol
    
    Ligand binding domain in the C terminal and effector domain in the central
    
    Ligand (Hormone) binds to nuclear receptors, resulting in dimerization
    
    The dimer moves to the nucleus and acts as transcription factors for certain genes
    

### Regulation of Receptors

- What are three ways that drugs can regulate receptors?
    
    Binding to receptor as an orthosteric agonist or allosteric modulator
    
    Mimick, inhibit or promote action of regulatory proteins of receptors
    
    Alter synthesis and degradation of receptors
    
- What are orthosteric and allosteric site? What are orthosteric and allosteric agonist?
    
    Orthosteric site (true site/binding site) - The binding site on a receptor for the endogenous agonist of the receptor
    
    Allosteric site (modulator) - Binding site on the receptor that is spatially distinct from the ollosteric site, but can alter conformation of the orthosteric site
    
    Orthosteric agonist - A ligand that binds to the orthosteric site of the receptor
    
    Allosteric agonist - A ligand that binds to the allosteric site of the receptor
    
- What are allosteric modulators? What are the two different types of allosteric modulators?
    
    Allosteric modulators - Allosteric agonist that bind to allosteric site on the receptor, to alter the orthosteric site, thus altering the action of the orthosteric agonist
    
    Positive Allosteric Modulator - Increase the action of orthosteric agonist (by increasing efficacy or affinity)
    
    Negative Allosteric Modulator - Decrease the action of orthosteric agonist (by decreasing affinity or efficacy)
    
- How may drugs affect regulatory proteins of receptors?
    
    Regulatory proteins of receptors regulate receptor activity
    
    Drugs can mimick, inhibit or promote action of regulatory proteins to regulate receptor activities
    
- How may drugs affect synthesis and degradation of receptors?
    
    Drugs may promote or inhibit synthesis and degradation of receptors, altering the receptor number
    

### Spare receptors

- What is spare receptor mechanism?
    
    Maximum drug response can be obtained by less than maximal occupation of the receptor
    
    A receptor is said to have spare receptor if Kd (concentration of drug for 50% occupancy) is greater than EC50 (concentration of drug to produce 50% of maximal effect)
    
- How does spare receptors affect dosage?
    
    Low concentration is required to achieve maximum drug response to reduce the toxic effects
    

### Drug Tolerance vs Drug Dependence

- What is drug tolerance?
    
    Drug tolerance is characterized by a decrease in drug response with repeated dose
    
    An increase in dose is required to maintain the same response
    
- What causes drug tolerance?
    
    Decreased concentration of drug at receptor
    
    Decrease in drug response produced by the receptor to the same concentration of drug (decreased efficacy)
    
    Decrease in number of receptors
    
- What is drug dependence?
    
    Drug dependence means that a person needs a drug to function normally
