### Asthma

- **Definition of Asthma**
    
    Paroxysmal occurrence of signs and symptoms that reflect underlying narrowing of airways, where asthmatic attacks are reversible spontaneously or by giving bronchodilators
    
    Quantitative definition of narrowed airway: FEV1/FEV ratio is reduced (<75-80%)
    
    Quantitative definition of reversibility of attacks - FEV1 increases by >12% of predicted value after bronchodilators
    
- **Classification of Asthma**
    - Extrinsic asthma
        - **What is extrinsic asthma?**
            
            Extrinsic asthma (classical/prototype/atopic asthma) refers to asthma that is mediated by IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction to a common environmental allergen
            
            It has childhood onset
            
            It is associated with family history of allergic conditions, i.e. allergy rhinitis, eczema and atopy
            
            Affects 5-10% of the population
            
        - **Pathogenesis of extrinsic asthma**
            
            Inhaled foreign antigen binds to IgE on mast cells, resulting in mast cell degranulation, releasing histamine, leukotrienes and eosinophil chemotaxic factors
            
            Histamine:
            
            Stimulates vasodilation, resulting in oedema
            
            Stimulates smooth muscle contraction, resulting in bronchospasm
            
            Stimulates mucus hypersecretion
            
            Leukotrienes:
            
            Stimulates smooth muscle contraction, resulting in bronchospasm
            
            Stimulates mucus hypersecretion
            
            Eosinophil chemotaxic factors:
            
            Results in in eosinophil chemotaxis and activation, releasing its granules (histamine)
            
            Hence, the overall effect includes:
            
            Vasodilation
            
            Oedema
            
            Mucus hyersecretion
            
            Bronchospasm

            Mucus plugs due to mucus hypersecretion
            
            Thick muscle coat due to bronchospasm
            
            Airway inflammation (inflammatory infiltrates with eosinophils)
            
            This results in airway narrowing/obstruction
            
            causing **increased airway resistance**
            
        - **Pathophysiology of asthma**
            
            Effects on ventilation:
            
            Increase in airway resistance causes impaired ventilation
            
            During inhalation, air entrance. into lungs is not impaired due to negative intrathoracic pressure, which is an active process
            
            During exhalation, air cannot leave the lungs as this depends on the elastic recoil of the lungs, which is a passive process
            
            This causes hypoxemia, but unlikely hypercapnia
            
        - **Clinical features of asthma**
            
            Clinical features:
            
            Shortness of breath (increase breathing rate)
            
            Long expiratory phase with wheezing (turbulent airflow due to mucus plugs)
            
            Cough
            
            Hyperinflation of lungs due to airtrapping
            
            Episodic attacks with full recovery of pulmonary functions between attacks
            
        - **Effects of lung volume changes in asthma**
            
            Increased in total lung capacity (hyperinflation of lungs due to airtrapping)
            
            Increased residual volume (deadspace)
            
            Decreased tidal volume
            
            Decreased vital capacity
            
            ![[9E4CF50B-9C46-4AB3-85C6-BAF40FA5AE9B.jpeg\|9E4CF50B-9C46-4AB3-85C6-BAF40FA5AE9B.jpeg]]
            
        - **Spirometry changes in asthma**
            
            Disproportionate decrease in FEV1, causing decrease in FEV1/FVC ratio (<75% predicted)
            
            Reversible by bronchodilators (>12% increase in FEV1)

        - **Outcomes of extrinsic asthma**
            
            If well-controlled childhood asthma, most likely subside in adolescence
            
    - Intrinsic asthma
        - **Etiology of intrinsic asthma**
            
            Unknown - can be caused by drugs, exercise, cold weather, viral infection, air pollution, stress
            
            Hyper-irritable airways
            
            Ref: [[Robbins  Non-atopic asthma\|Robbins  Non-atopic asthma]] 
            
        - **Onset of intrinsic asthma**
            
            Adult onset
            
        - **Reversibility of intrinsic asthma**
            
            Not fully reversible, residual decreased pulmonary functions after episode subsides
            
- **Hallmarks of asthma**
    
    Irreversible bronchoconstriction
    
    Bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy and hypereactivity
    
    Chronic inflammation with eosinophils
    
    Increased mucus secretion
    

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

- **Eitiology/risk factors of COPD**
    
    Tobacco:
    
    Around 50% of chronic smokers develop COPD
    
    Around 80% to 95% of COPD cases are attributed to smoking
    
    Other contributing factors:
    
    Occupational - coal mining, cadmium, welding, isocyanates etc.
    
    Air pollution - sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides
    
- **2 clinicopathological entities of COPD**
    - Chronic bronchitis
        - **What is chronic bronchitis?**
            
            Chronic bronchitis is the chronic inflammation of the airway
            
        - **Pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis**
            
            Repeated exposure of cigarrette smoke and irritant gas causes chronic inflammation of bronchi
            
            Eventually, chronic inflammation results in irreversible, progressive peribronchial fibrosis, where scar tissues contract, causing narrowing and obstruction of airway
            
            Cigarette smoke results in increased thickness of layer of mucous glands in the mucosa, and increase in mucin-secreting goblet cells, causing mucus hypersecretion, forming mucus plugs that obstruct the airway
            
            Mucus accumulation also predisposes to infection

        - **Pathology of chronic bronchitis**
            
            Mucus plug, due to mucus gland hypertrophy leading to small airway obstruction
            
            Chronic inflammation of the airway wall
            
            Peribronchial fibrosis

            Ref: [[West’s pulmonary pathophysiology  Pathology of chronic bronchitis\|West’s pulmonary pathophysiology  Pathology of chronic bronchitis]] 
            
        - **Diagnostic criteria of chronic bronchitis as definition of chronic bronchitis**
            
            Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed in clinical grounds
            
            It is defined by the presence of persistant productive cough with mucoid sputum (due to mucus hypersecretion) for at least 3 consecutive months in 2 consecutive years
            
            *Note: Must have history of smoking, No evidence of other lung disease accounting for the coughing
            
    - Emphysema
        - **Definition of emphysema**
            
            Defined on pathological terms
            
            Emphysema is defined as the abnormal enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by destruction of alveolar walls without significant fibrosis
            
        - **Risk factors of emphysema**
            
            Behavorial - smoking
            
            Genetic - Hereditary alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficiency
            
        - **Pathogenesis of emphysema**
            
            Cigarrete smoke causes inflammation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages
            
            Oxidative stress:
            
            Reactive oxidative species (ROS) are generated by neutrophils and macrophages, causing apoptosis tissue damage
            
            Protease-antiprotease imbalance:
            
            Protease released by neutrophils and macrophages results in increased protease activity, breaking down extracellular matrix
            
            This results in parenchymal destruction, and enlargement of airspaces

        - **Pathophysiology of emphysema**
            
            Apoptosis and destruction of alveolar tissue, results in:
            
            Diffusion impairments:
            
            Due to loss of surface area for gas exchange
            
            Airway obstruction:
            
            Due to degradation of extracellular matrix, it results in loss of elastic recoil of on small airways, resulting in decreased radial traction on small airways and premature closure of small airways during expiration
            
            This results in air trapping as well (deadspace)
            
        - **Clinical features of emphysema**
            
            Shortness of breath
            
            Chronic productive cough
            
            Barrel chest
            
            Long expiratory phase with expiratory wheeze (decrease in FEV1/FVC ratio)
            
- **Long term complications of COPD**
    
    Chronic hypoxia
    
    Pulmonary hypertension due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
    
    Cor pumonale
    
    Polycythaemia
    
    Association with cancer
