### Receptive relaxation of the stomach enables the stomach to function as a food reservoir

Receptive relaxation of the stomach is the first stage of motor functions in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastric motor functions\|Gastric motor functions]] in the fed state.

The receptive relaxation of the stomach is the **decrease in the smooth muscle tone of the gastric wall, that enables it to accomodate greater and greater amounts of food without an increase in pressure.**

- ********************************************************************************************Control of receptive relaxation of the stomach********************************************************************************************
    
    As food enters, it distends the stomach. Distension of the stomach triggers the long vagovagal reflex:
    
    - The afferent vagal pathway stimulates the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, which stimulates the vagal efferent pathways.
    - Vagal efferent pathways stimulates inhibitory neurons of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]], while inhibiting excitatory neurons of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]].
        - Stimulation of inhibitory neurons of the Enteric nervous system results in release of Nitric oxide and Vasoactive inhibitory peptide (VIP), which stimulates smooth muscle relaxation.
        - Inhibition of excitatory neurons results in inhibition of release of acetylcholine, which inhibits smooth muscle relaxation.

    This results in decrease in smooth muscle tone of the gastric wall.
