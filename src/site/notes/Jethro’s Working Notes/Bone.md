### Bone

Bone is made of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bone tissue\|Bone tissue]], which consist of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bone matrix\|Bone matrix]] and 3 cell types: [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoblast\|Osteoblast]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteocyte\|Osteocyte]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoclast\|Osteoclast]]. Bone plays many functions ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Functions of bones\|Functions of bones]].

### Gross examination of bone

On gross examination of the bone in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Skeletal system\|Skeletal system]], reveals [[Jethro’s Working Notes/5 types of bones by shape\|5 types of bones by shape]]. Gross examination of a *************cross section************* of a bone may reveal 2 bone types: Compact bones and spongy bones ([[Compact bone and spongy bone differ by the presence of cavities\|Compact bone and spongy bone differ by the presence of cavities]]).

### Histological examination of bone

[[Primary bone and secondary bone differ histologically\|Primary bone and secondary bone differ histologically]].

### Bone development

[[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteogenesis\|Osteogenesis]] occurs via 2 mechanisms: [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intramembranous ossification\|Intramembranous ossification]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Endochondral ossification\|Endochondral ossification]].

Endochondral ossification also underlies elongation of long bones, enabled by an [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Epiphyseal plate\|Epiphyseal plate]], and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bone repair\|Bone repair]].
