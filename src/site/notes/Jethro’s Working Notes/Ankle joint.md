### Ankle joint

Ankle joint is the articulation between the tallus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot\|Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot]]) and the distal ends of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tibia\|Tibia]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Fibula\|Fibula]].

- **Classification of ankle joint and its movements**
    
    It is classified as a synovial hinge joint, enabling dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.

- **Stabilization of the ankle joint**
    
    The ankle joint is stabilized by two extrinsic ligaments: the medial (Deltoid ligament) and lateral ligament.
    
    **Medial ligament**
    
    The medial (deltoid) ligament is a triangular ligament with its apex at the medial malleolus of the tibia, and is separated into 4 parts by its distal attachment:
    
    - Tibionavicular ligament
    - Tibiocalcanear ligament
    - Anterior tibiotalar ligament
    - Posterior tibiotalar ligament

    **Lateral ligament**
    
    The lateral ligament is composed of 3 separate ligaments:
    
    - Anterior talofibular ligament - which attaches to the tallus and the fibula anteriorly.
    - Posterior talofibular ligament - which attaches the tallus and the fibula posteriorly.
    - Calcaneofibular ligament - which attaches the calcaneus and the fibula laterally.

- **The ankle joint is more stable in dorsiflexion than in plantarflexion**
    
    Note when viewed superiorly, the anterior parts of the tallus is wider than the posterior part, such that in dorsiflexion, the tallus is inserted more tightly into the notch. Furthermore, the tibiofibular ligaments are taut in this position.
