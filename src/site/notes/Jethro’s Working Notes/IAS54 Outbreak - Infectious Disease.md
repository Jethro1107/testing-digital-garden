# IAS54: Outbreak - Infectious Disease

Created: January 10, 2022 8:22 PM
Updated: June 18, 2022 11:20 AM

- What are communicable diseases?
    
    A disease that can be spread, directly or indirectly, from one person to another person or from other specie to humans
    
    They are caused by pathogenic microorganisms (infectious agents)
    

### Communicable disease

- What is Koch's postulate?
    
    Koch's Postulate refers to the criteria for associating a specific pathogen with a disease
    
    The pathogen is present in every case of the disease in question and can account for the pathological changes and clinical course of the disease
    
    The pathogen occurs in no other disease as a fortuitous and nonpathogenic pathogen
    
    After being isolated from the body, the pathogen can be repeatedly grown in pure culture and can induce the disease anew
    
    The pathogen can be re-isolated from the experimentally inoculated host 
    
- What are the limitations of Koch's postulate?
    
    There is a possible state of asymptomatic infections
    
    Not all microbes can be isolated / cultured
    
    Not all microbes can be experimentally inoculated in a suitable animal model to reproduce the infection
    
- How are infectious agents classified?
    
    Prions, Viruses, Bacteria, Fungi, Parasite
    

### Modes of Transmission for Communicable Disease

- How are modes of transmission roughly classified? How is it further classified?
    
    Direct and Indirect transmission
    
    Direct transmission is further classified into Direct Contact Transmission, and Droplet transmission
    
    Direct contact transmission involves the transmission of the infectious agent from one skin/mucosal surface to another skin/mucosal surface-borne 
    
    Droplet transmission refers to the transmission of infectious agents via large aerosols that travel within a short-distance to another mucosal surface
    
    Indirect transmission is further classified into air-borne transmission, vehicle transmission and vector borne transmission
    
    Air-borne transmission refers to the the transmission of infectious agents via fine-size dust or droplet nuclei that may suspend in air for an extended period of time
    
    Vehicle transmission refers to the transmission of infectious agent via food, water, blood or fomites. The vehicle may passively carry the pathogen or provide an environment in which the pathogen multiplies or produces toxins
    
    Vector transmission refers to the transmission of infectious agents via mosquitoes, fleas or ticks. The vector can be purely mechanically, or may support replication or development of the infectious agent
    
- Use an example to show that an infectious agent may be transmitted via multiple transmission modes.
    
    When we sneeze, aerosols are expelled from our respiratory system, some are large and can only travel over a short distance before falling, some are fine and can suspend in air
    
    Large aerosols may deposit on surface
    
    Hence, this allows for droplet transmission, air-borne transmission and fomites transmission (vehicle transmission)
    
- What are portal of entry, site of replication, and portal of exit?
- What might be the targets of public health interventions?
    
    Eliminating infectious agents at the source of transmission - discarding contaminated food, quarantine
    
    Preventing the portals of entry - surgical masks, bed nets
    
    Increasing host defence - Vaccination
    

### Public Health Surveillance

- What is public health surveillance?
    
    Public health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data regarding health-relating events for use in public health action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve health
    
- What is the ultimate purpose of surveillance systems?
    
    Provide information to guide public health actions
    
- What are the different types of surveillance system? How do they differ?
    
    Passive Surveillance and Active Surveillance - depend on mode of data collection
    
    Passive Surveillance - Diseases are reported by healthcare providers (Simple, and inexpensive,  useful for routine surveillance activities, but limited to incomplete reporting and variability of quality)
    
    Active Surveillance - Health agencies contact healthcare providers seeking report (Resource intensive, more complete reporting)
    
- What are the different data sources for public health surveillance?
    
    Vital statistics
    
    Statistics on communicable disease
    
    Statutory notifiable diseases (required by law)
    
    Sentinel surveillance (not required, may consist of artefacts, variability in quality)
    
    Statistics on Antimicrobial Resistance Control
    
    Statistics on Laboratory Surveillance
    
    Registries
    

### Outbreak, Epidemic, Endemic and Pandemic

- What is outbreak?
    
    A situation when disease or health events occur at a greater frequency than normally expected within a specified period and place
    
    - The occurrence of a greater number of disease than normally occurs in the same place during the same period in past years (by comparison with baseline surveillance data)
    - A cluster of cases of the same disease that can be linked to the same exposure
    - A single case of disease that has never occurred before or might have a significant implication for public health policy and practice
- What is epidemic?
    
    Occurrence of disease or health event clearly in excess of normal expectancy in a community or region
    
- What is pandemic?
    
    An epidemic occurring worldwide or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and affecting a large number of people
    
- What is endemic?
    
    The constant presence of a disease or infectious agent within a given geographic area or population group
    
- What is an epidemic curve?
    
    An epidemic curve shows the progression of illness and magnitude of an outbreak over time
    
    Note: Inherent delay between date of illness onset and the date that the case is reported
    
- What is basic reproduction number? What is the relations of R0 and outbreak?
    
    The average number of secondary infections caused by an individual in a naive population of susceptible host
    
    When R0 > 1, an outbreak continues until there is not enough susceptible host to support onward transmission, in that case R0 < 1
    
    Potential magnitude of outbreak is based on R0 value
    
- What is herd immunity?
    
    Herd effect - The risk of infection among susceptible individuals of a population is reduced by the presence and proximity of immune individuals
    
    Immunity is required through infection or vaccination
    
- What is herd immunity threshold?
    
    A threshold proportion of immune individuals (generally via vaccination) that leads to a decline in incidence of infection
    
    Herd immunity threshold = [(R0-1)/R0]
    
- Describe the anatomy of an epidemic.
    
    Establishment - No. of infection is small
    
    Exponential growth - No. of new infections grow exponentially
    
    Exponential peak and decline - Susceptible pool has been sufficiently depleted such that the reproductive number is 1
    
    Whether the disease becomes endemic or a recurrent epidemic depends on the replenishment of the susceptible pool
    

### Outbreak Investigations

- What is the purpose of outbreak investigation?
    
    To prevent additional cases by identifying and eliminating the source off illness, i.e. to control the current outbreak
    
    Other purposes include prevention of future outbreak, to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention programs, and to respond to public, media, political and legal concerns
    
- How do we usually recognise there is an outbreak?
    
    Alert Clinicians
    
    Signals from surveillance systems
    
    Reports from local media
    
    Laboratory identifying novel pathogen
    
    Alarm is raised, but still rely on definition of outbreak to verify
    
    Greater frequency of disease or infectious agent than normally expected in the same period and place
    
- What are the problems in an outbreak investigation?
    
    Trigger for recognition may bias investigation
    
    Media and political pressure may hasten decisions, resulting in mistakes
    
- List the essential components of outbreak investigations.
    
    Confirm the existence of the outbreak
    
    Come up with case definitions to find cases
    
    Describe epidemeology (person, place and time)
    
    Determine aetiology/cause of the outbreak and test the hypothesis using an analytic study (e.g. Koch's Postulate)
    
    Identify risk factors for transmission and modes of transmission and come up with public health interventions that work
    
    Investigate and establish the origin of the outbreak (Reservoir of pathogen)
    
    Implement control and prevention measures to reduce risk of recurrence
    
    Communication 
    
- How do we confirm the existence of the outbreak?
    
    Outbreak is defined as the situation in which a disease occurs at a greater frequency than normally expected at a specific period and place
    
    Hence, use baseline surveillance data to verify if the frequency of a disease exceeds normal expectations
    
    Be aware of artefactual increases such as changes in reporting practices and changes in case definition
    
- What is a case definition?
    
    A standard set of criteria for deciding whether an individual should be classified as having the health condition of interest
    
    It tends to include clinical criteria and restrictions by time, and place, but never include the exposure or risk factor you are evaluating
    
    Early in investigation, different categories of case definitions are created e.g. Confirmed, Probable
    
- How does case definition affect history taking in a clinical setting?
    
    New questions will be asked upon clinical suspicion
    
    e.g. Taking travel history when patient has respiratory illness during COVID outbreak
    
- What is the epidemiological triangle?
    
    An epidemiological model explaining the relationship between Host, Agent and Environment and its contribution to spread of disease
    
- What is zoonosis? Do zoonotic pathogens generally cause epidemic?
    
    Zoonosis is the process in which animal pathogens cross species barrier to infect people
    
    Epidemic requires efficient transmission between humans
    
    Since most zoonotic pathogens cannot be transmitted efficiently from human to human, most zoonotic pathogens cannot cause epidemics
    
    Exceptions: 09 Swine Flu, HIV, H1N1, COVID-19
    
- What is 'One Health'?
    
    Collaborative effects of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment
    
    The main goal is to investigate zoonosis and identify emerging infectious diseases
    
- What are emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EID)?
    
    Infectious diseases that newly appear in the human population, or are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic distribution
    
- What are factors predisposing to infectious disease emergence/re-emergence?
    
    International travel /trade
    
    Consumption of wild game animals etc.
    
- When should communication occur in an outbreak investigation?
    
    Along all steps of outbreak and even before outbreak
    
    Build trust with the public in 'peacetime' such that they trust you in crisis
