### Adverse Drug Reaction

- Define Adverse Drug Reaction.
    
    Any response to a drug which is noxious, unintended and occurs at doses used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy (WHO, 1976)
    
    An adverse drug reaction is a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended (European Medicines Agency, 2010)
    
- What may be the cause of drug toxicity?
    
    Toxicity may be dose related
    
    Toxicity may be idiosyncratic - Occurs without reason
    
    Now we know idiosyncratic reactions are genetically determined abnormal reactivity to a chemical
    
- Compare serious and severe.
    
    Serious - refers to the nature of an ADR
    
    Severe - refers to the extent of an ADR
    
- What may be the difference between different toxic response?
    
    Immediate vs delayed
    
    Transient vs permanent
    
    Reversible vs irreversible
    
- What are the 6 types of adverse drug reaction. Briefly explain.
    
    Classified into Types A, B, C, D, E and F
    
    Type A (augmented)
    
    An exaggerated pharmacological response that is dose-related
    
    Type B (bizarre):
    
    Non-pharmacological response, but often an allergic response that is idiosyncratic
    
    Type C (chronic):
    
    Long term effects of drugs, often due to drug accumulation
    
    Type D (delayed):
    
    Dose-independent delayed effects, e.g. drugs leading to carcinogenesis
    
    Type E (end-of treatment):
    
    Adverse effects due to withdrawal treatments
    
    e.g. In the case of psychiatric disease
    
    Type F (failure of efficacy):
    
    No response to a drug
    
    e.g. Due to resistance to antimicrobial
    
- What is Type A ADR?
    
    Predictable pharmacological reactions that is normal but augmented, usually dose dependent
    
    Will develop in most patients given a large dose
    
    High incidence, low mortality

- What is Type B ADR?
    
    Unpredictable idiosyncratic reactions, that is normally dose-independent
    
    Low incidence, high mortality
    
- What is drug allergy?
    
    Also known as hypersensitivity to drugs
    
    A Type B ADR
    
    It results in previous sensitization to the same drug or a closely related one
    
    Unrelated to pharmacological response, but usually due to an immunological response
    
    Ranges in severity from mild skin rashes to fatal anaphylactic shock
    
- Describe the immunological basis of drug allergy.
    
    Most drugs have insufficient molecular mass to be immunogenic
    
    Drugs (hapten) are enzymatically metabolized to reactive forms that form covalent conjugates with host proteins to become immunogenic
    
    Upon first exposure to the drug, the drut conjugates with a protein and triggers an immune response, such that the person is sensitized to the drug
    
    Subsequent exposure results in hypersensitive reactions to drugs
    
- Discuss the different types of drug allergies.
    
    Type 1 - immediate, anaphylactic (mediated by IgE)
    
    Type 2 - cytotoxic antibody (IgG, IgM)
    
    Type 3 - Immune complex (IgG, IgM)
    
    Type 4 - delayed hypersensitivity (T cells)
    
    Hapten bound protein phagocytosed, and presented to T cells
    
- How is ADR prevented?
    
    Taka a careful drug history
    
    Take a careful family history in allergies and genetic diseases
    
    Avoid drugs susceptible to ADRs
    
    Patient factors - Poor renal function, resulting in poor clearance of drugs, lower dose to avoid Type A ADR
    

### Pharmacogenomics (PGx)

- What is pharmacogenomics? What is the purpose of pharmacogenomics?
    
    Pharmacogenomics is the use of DNA and amino acid sequence data to inform drug development and testing
    
    An important application of pharmacogenomics is correlating individual genetic variation with drug response
    
- What are the genetic differences relevant in drug development?
    
    Genetic differences affecting pharmacodynamics
    
    Genetic differences that affect pharmacodynamics
    
    Genes that is not related to a drug's pharmacology but can predispose toxicity such as immune reactions
    

**Pharmacogenomics in PK**

- How may genetic differences account for differences in drug metabolism?
    
    Genetic differences may result in differences in drug metabolism
    
    People who metabolize drugs really quickly cannot reach the therapeutically effective blood and tissue concentration
    
    People who metabolize drugs really slowly may experience toxic effects in usual doses
    
- What is the major CYP450 monooxygenase that plays a major role in drug metabolism?
    
    CYP2D6
    
- Draw relations to Activity Score (AS) of CYP2D6 and the metabolic phenotypes.
    
    Poor metabolizer (PM) - No functional allele 0
    
    Intermediate metabolizer (IM) - 1 reduced allele 1 non-funtional allele 0.5
    
    Extensive metabolizers (EM) - Two functional allele, 1 functional 1 reduced, 1 functional 1 non-functional 1-2 
    
    Ultrarapid metabolizers (UM) - more than 2 functional allele >2
