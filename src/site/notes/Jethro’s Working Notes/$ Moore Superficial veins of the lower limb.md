# $ Moore: Superficial veins of the lower limb

****Superficial Veins of Lower Limb****

The two major superficial veins in the lower limb are the *great and small saphenous veins* (Fig. 7.14A, B). Most of their tributaries are unnamed.

The **great saphenous vein** is formed by the union of the *dorsal vein of the great toe* and the *dorsal venous arch of the foot* (Figs. 7.15A and 7.16A). The great saphenous vein

- ascends anterior to the medial malleolus.
- passes posterior to the medial condyle of the femur (about a hand's breadth posterior to the medial border of the patella).
- anastomoses freely with the small saphenous vein.
- traverses the saphenous opening in the fascia lata.
- empties into the femoral vein.

The great saphenous vein has 10–12 valves, which are more numerous in the leg than in the thigh (Fig. 7.15A, D). These valves are usually located just inferior to the perforating veins. The perforating veins also have valves.

**Venous valves** are cusps (flaps) of endothelium with cup-like *valvular sinuses* that fill from above. When they are full, the valve cusps occlude the lumen of the vein, thereby preventing reflux of blood distally, making flow unidirectional. The valvular mechanism also breaks the column of blood in the saphenous vein into shorter segments, reducing back pressure. Both effects make it easier for the *musculovenous pump* (discussed in [Chapter 1](https://meded-lwwhealthlibrary-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacySectionId=moore8-moore-8-moore-ch001), Overview and Basic Concepts) to overcome the force of gravity to return the blood to the heart.

As it ascends in the leg and thigh, the great saphenous vein receives numerous tributaries and communicates in several locations with the small saphenous vein. Tributaries from the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh frequently unite to form an **accessory saphenous vein** (Fig. 7.15B). When present, this vein becomes the main communication between the great and small saphenous veins.

Also, fairly large vessels, the **lateral** and **anterior cutaneous veins**, arise from networks of veins in the inferior part of the thigh and enter the great saphenous vein superiorly, just before it enters the femoral vein. Near its termination, the great saphenous vein also receives the superficial circumflex iliac, superficial epigastric, and external pudendal veins (Fig. 7.15A).

The **small saphenous vein** arises on the lateral side of the foot from the union of the *dorsal vein of the little toe* with the *dorsal venous arch* (Fig. 7.15B, C). The small saphenous vein

- 
    
    ascends posterior to the lateral malleolus as a continuation of the lateral marginal vein.
    
- 
    
    passes along the lateral border of the calcaneal tendon.
    
- 
    
    inclines to the midline of the fibula and penetrates the deep fascia.
    
- 
    
    ascends between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle.
    
- 
    
    empties into the popliteal vein in the popliteal fossa.
    

Although many tributaries are received by the saphenous veins, their diameters remain remarkably uniform as they ascend the limb. This is possible because the blood received by the saphenous veins is continuously shunted from these superficial veins in the subcutaneous tissue to the deep veins internal to the deep fascia by means of many perforating veins.

The **perforating veins** penetrate the deep fascia close to their origin from the superficial veins and contain valves that allow blood to flow only from the superficial veins to the deep veins (Fig. 7.15A, D). The perforating veins pass through the deep fascia at an oblique angle so that when muscles contract and the pressure increases inside the deep fascia, the perforating veins are compressed. Compression of these veins also prevents blood from flowing from the deep to the superficial veins. This pattern of venous blood flow—from superficial to deep—is important for proper venous return from the lower limb because it enables muscular contractions to propel blood toward the heart against gravity (**musculovenous pump;** see [Fig. 1.26](https://meded-lwwhealthlibrary-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacySectionId=moore8-moore-8-moore-ch001-fig026) in [Chapter 1](https://meded-lwwhealthlibrary-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/content.aspx?legacySectionId=moore8-moore-8-moore-ch001), Overview and Basic Concepts).
