### Likelihood ratio

**Likelihood ratio**, describes the performance of the test by *relating the probability of a test result in someone with disease to someone without disease*. It is an entity that encompasses ******************************************************sensitivity and specificity******************************************************, and as a result is solely affected by the technical aspect of the test, irrespective of the population tested on.

As test results are dichotomised (i.e. positive results and negative results), a test will have 2 likelihood ratios:

- Positive likelihood ratio - How much a positive result increases the probability of disease
- Negative likelihood ratio - How much a negative result decreases the probability fo disease

Cf: [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Likelihood ratio\|Likelihood ratio]] 

### There are two use cases of likelihood ratio

1. To appraise the performance of the test, and determines its use case

2. To calculate the post-test odds using the odds likelihood approach ([[There are different methods of appraising post-test probability after the application of diagnostic tests\|There are different methods of appraising post-test probability after the application of diagnostic tests]]).
