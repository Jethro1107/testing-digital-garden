### Different loss of function mutations underlie the pathogenesis of Type I Osteogenesis Imperfecta

Type I Osteogenesis Imperfecta is caused by autosomal dominant inheritance of a loss-of-function mutation in COL1A1 or COL1A2 gene, often resulting in haploinsufficiency, i.e. reduced amount of type I collagen in bones.

    It involves nonsense mutation (base substitution that results in a stop codon):
    
    - Nonsense mediated mRNA decay, where no protein is formed
    - Truncating mutation, resulting in loss of function.
