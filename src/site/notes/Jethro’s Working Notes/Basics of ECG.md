# Basics of ECG

### What is an ECG?

An ECG is an electrical snapshot of the heart

### Recording an ECG

12-lead ECG uses 10 electrodes to produce 12 leads (leads are graphical representation of electrical activity, or electrical view of the heart), which consist of 6 limb leads and 6 chest leads/ precordial leads

- **6** **Limb leads**
    - 4 limb electrodes (RA, RL, LA, LL) are used to create 6 limb leads (Lead I, Lead II, Lead III, aVR, aVL, aVF)
    - The 4 limb electrodes are colour coded: 黃綠醫生 左手左腳 紅天黑地 右手右腳
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - Limb leads view electrical activity of the heart in a frontal plane
    - Lead I, II and III are bipolar limb leads
    - aVR, aVL and aVF are unipolar limb leads
    
    | Leads | Positive electrode | Negative electrode |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Lead I | LA | RA |
    | Lead II | RA | LL |
    | Lead III | LA | LL |
    | aVR | RA | average of LA and LL |
    | aVL | LA | average of RA and LL |
    | aVF | LL | average of LA and RA |

- 6 **Precordial leads:**
    - V1-V6 visualizes electrical activity of the heart in the frontal plane
    - V1-V2 indicates interventricular septum
    - V3-V4 indicates anterior aspect of the heart
    - V5-V6 indicates the left lateral aspect of the heart
    
    | V1 | right sternal border, 4th intercostal space |
    | --- | --- |
    | V2 | left sternal border, 4th intercostal space |
    | V3 | Between V2 and V3 |
    | V4 | Left 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line |
    | V5 | Between V6 and V6 |
    | V6 | 5th intercostal space mid-axillary line |

The ECG strip is produced at a standard chart speed of 25mm/s (i.e. 1 5 large box per second), and the voltage is 10mm/mV

### Components of an ECG

- P wave - Atrial depolarization
- PR segment - From the end of P wave to the start of the QRS complex
- PR interval (more commonly used) - From beginning of P wave to the beginning of QRS complex, it indicates the time taken for SA node to fire an action potential, spread through the atrial muscles, the AV node and bundle of His to depolarize the the ventricle
    - The PR interval is very short: 0.12-0.2 seconds only (3-5 small boxes)
- QRS complex - Ventricular depolarization (not contraction)
    - Q wave - 1st negative deflection, indicating septal depolarization from left to right
    - R wave - 1st positive deflection (regardless of the presence of Q wave)
    - S wave - 2nd negative deflection beyond isoelectric line (must follow R wave)
    - The QRS complex normally is 0.12s (3 small boxes)
- ST segment - From the end of the QRS complex and the start of T wave, indicating ventricular contraction
- QT interval - From the beginning of QRS complex to the end of T wave
    - Male <0.44s
    - Female <0.46s
    - Rate sensitive - calculate QTc (corrected QT intervals)

### Approach to ECG

An ECG should be approached in the same way (RRPWQST)

Rate - Calculated by box method (300/number of large boxes) or number of R waves

Rhythm - regular or irregular?

P wave - Is P wave present? and is each QRS complex preceded by P wave? Multiple P waves? Is it sinus rhythm

Width of QRS complex - Wide or narrow complex? - BBB, VTach

Q wave - Is there deep Q wave, indicative of old myocardial infarction

ST segment changes - isoelectric, elevated or depressed? indicating ischaemia and infarction

T wave changes - Normally inverted in aVR and lead I, inverted indicates ischaemia
