### Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction

Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction occurs in 3 steps:

1. Upon arrival of action potential to the presynaptic terminal activates L-type Ca2+ channel (which is a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. Influx of Ca2+ results in release of acetylcholine via exocytosis of synaptic vesicles.
2. ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to AChR at the postsynaptic terminal, which results in the opening of the ligand-gated cation channel.
3. This results in the influx of Na+, and a small efflux of K+. The net effect is graded depolarization to threshold, resulting in generation of muscle action potential, that can eventually result in excitation-contraction coupling.
