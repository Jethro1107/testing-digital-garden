### Antibiotics used in treating Helicobacter pylori infections

4 antibiotics are used in the treatment of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Helicobacter pylori\|Helicobacter pylori]] infections:

- Amoxicillin
- Clarythromycin
- Tetracycline
- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Metronidazole\|Metronidazole]]
    - **MOA of metronidazole**
        
        Metronidazole is chemically reduced by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), which can only be found in anaerobic organisms. 
        
        The resulting metabolite binds to DNA to disrupt the helical structure, causing DNA break. This inhibits DNA synthesis.
        
    - **Adverse effects of metronidazole**
        
        Side effects include:
        
        - GI disturbance
        - Metallic taste
        - Occasionally sensory neuropathy
    - **Resistance to metronidazole**
        
        Most strains of H. pylori is resistant to metronidazole.
        
    - **Mechanism of metronidazole resistance**
        
        Metronidazole can be caused by a *reduction in activity of pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase*, resulting in decreased activation of metronidazole.
