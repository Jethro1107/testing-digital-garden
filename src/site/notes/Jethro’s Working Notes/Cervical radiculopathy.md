### Cervical radiculopathy

Cervical radiculopathy is a pathological process involving nerve root irritation (commonly caused by degenerative changes in the intervertebral foramina).

- ****************************************************************************Pathoanatomy of cervical radiculopathy****************************************************************************
    
    Cervical radiculopathy is mainly caused by:
    
    - Cervical spondylosis - Degenerative changes in the vertebral bodies, facet joints, uncovertebral joints, resulting in osteophyte (bone spur) formation compressing onto nerve roots in the intervertebral foramina.
    - Intervertebral disc herniation ([[Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation\|Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation]]), in the foraminal area or lateral recess, is likely to compress onto nerve roots in the intervertebral foramina.
- **************************************************************************************Clinical features of cervical radiculopathy**************************************************************************************
    
    Cervical radiculopathy generally cause:
    
    - Neck and upper limb pain.
    - Muscle weakness (motor symptoms) of the upper limb in a myotomal pattern.
    - Sensory symptoms, such as parasthesia (burning and tinkling sensation), numbness, that is usually dermatomal.
- ************************Physical examination findings of cervical radiculopathy************************
    
    The aim of physical examination in cervical radiculopathy is to find sensory and motor abnormalities in dermatomal and myotomal patterns, as well as to exclude upper motor neuron lesions such as [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Cervical myelopathy\|Cervical myelopathy]]:
    
    - There may be reduced deep tendon reflex (Hyporeflexia):
        - Lower motor neuron lesions in C5 to C6 spinal levels can cause reduced biceps reflex (Biceps brachii and brachioradialis).
        - Lower motor neuron lesions in C7 spinal levels can cause reduced tricep reflex.
