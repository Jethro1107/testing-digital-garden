### Penicillin

Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic, that inhibits cell wall synthesis. It is bactericidal.

- **MOA of penicillin**
    
    Transpeptidation/Formation of peptidoglycan NAM-NAM cross-links is catalysed by penicillin binding proteins (PBP), which has Transpeptidase (TPase) activity.
    
    The Beta-lactam ring of penicillin opens and mimics the D-ala-D-ala residue on NAM units, thus covalently binds to and inhibits these TPase enzymes (PBP).
    
    However, additional NAM and NAG is added without the formation of cross-links.
    
    The integrity of the peptidoglycan layer is reduced and weakened.
    
    Cell wall synthesis inhibition activates autolysin to destroy existing cell walls, which results in cell lysis due to the osmotic pressure.
    
    Cf: [[    Mechanism of Action    \|    Mechanism of Action    ]] 
    
- **How does penicillin reach its site of action?**
    
    In Gram positive (G+) bacteria, it directly diffuses across the peptidoglycan layer and binds to PBP.
    
    In Gram negative (G-) bacteria, it requires active transport via hydrophilic channels (e.g. porin channels) across the outer membrane.

- **Classification of penicillins**
    - Natural penicillins
        - **Examples of natural penicillins**
            
            Penicillin G, Penicillin V
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Spectrum of natural penicillins and susceptibility to Beta-lactamases**
            
            Natural penicillin has a very narrow spectrum - greatest activity against gram positive cocci, gram negative cocci and non beta-lactamase-producing anaerobes.
            
            They are susceptible to beta-lactamases.
            
        - **Administration route of different natural penicillin**
            
            Penicillin G - Parenteral route
            
            Penicillin V - Oral route as it is resistant to acid hydrolysis
            
    - Antistaphylococcal penicillin
        - **Examples of antistaphylococcal penicillin**
            
            Methicillin (too nephrotoxic, no longer used), flucoxacillin, coxacillin, oxacillin
            
        - **Properties of antistaphylococcal penicillin relating to the spectrum of antistaphylococcal penicillin**
            
            Antistaphylococcal penicillin consist of a bulky side chain that block action of beta-lactamase which hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring, making them resistant against the action of penicillinase (staphylococcal beta-lactamase).
            
            - This makes them the drug of choice for treating staphylococcus infections (MSSA).
            - However, they are less effective than other penicillin due to difficulty of penetration as a result of the bulky side chain.
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Administration route of antistaphylococcal penicillin**
            
            IV route, oral route (resist acid hydrolysis)
            
    - Aminopenicillins / extended spectrum aminopenicillin
        - **Examples of aminopenicillins**
            
            Ampicilin, amoxicillin
            
        - **Properties of aminopenicillins relating to the spectrum of aminopenicillins**
            
            Addition of hydrophilic groups facilitate the uptake of aminopenicillins in gram negative bacteria via porins
            
            Thus effective against gram-negative bacteria
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Similar gram positive coverage as natural penicillin, but with increased effectiveness against gram positive bacilli
            
            Not active against pseudomonal species
            
            Susceptible against beta-lactamase
            
        - **Administrative routes of aminopenicillins**
            
            IV route
            
            Oral route (both resist acid hydrolysis, but amoxicillin has a higher oral bioavailability than ampicillin)
            
    - Antipseudomonal penicillins
        - **Examples of antipseudomonal penicillins**

            Ureidopenicillin - piperacillin
            
        - **Properties of antipseudomonal penicillins relating to the spectrum of antipseudomonal penicillins**
            
            Addition of hydrophilic groups facilitate the uptake of antipsueudomonal penicillins in gram negative bacteria via porins
            
            Thus effective against gram-negative bacteria
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Effective against many gram-negative bacilli and pseudomonas aeruginosa
            
            Susceptible to acid hydrolysis
            
            Susceptible against beta-lactamase
            
        - **Administrative routes of antipseudomonal penicillins**

- **Adverse effect of penicillin**
    
    Low toxicity
    
    Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction in 5% of patients
    
    Diarrhoea
    
    Seizures at high doses - cautious in epileptic patients
    
    Large doses of Na+/K+ salts can cause cation toxicity
    
- **Mechanism of penicillin resistance**
    1. Primary mechanism - Beta-lactamase
    2. Mutation in genes expressing penicillin binding proteins
    3. Mutations in genes expressing porins in gram negative bacteria, resulting in tight porins that limit permeability
    4. Increased efflux pumps
