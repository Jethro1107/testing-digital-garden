### Glucose reabsorption of kidneys

- **Main site of glucose reabsorption**
    
    Proximal tubules in the renal cortex
    
- **Relationship between freely filtered glucose, renal reabsorption of glucose and plasma glucose levels**
    
    Freely filtered glucose increases linearly with plasma glucose level
    
    Renal reabsorption of glucose increases linearly with plasma glucose level until renal reabsorption of glucose reaches the tubular maximal glucose re-absorptive capacity, at plasma glucose level of renal threshold for glucose excretion
    
    Once plasma glucose level exceeds renal threshold for glucose excretion, glucosuria may be seen

- **What is renal threshold for glucose excretion, tubular maximum glucose re-absorptive capacity and their values?**
    
    Renal threshold for glucose excretion (RTG) - Threshold of plasma glucose level for glucose excretion to occur (<11mmol/L in healthy individuals) 
    
    Tubular maximal glucose re-absorptive capacity (TmG) - Maximal amount of glucose reabsorbed by the tubules per unit time (375mg/min)
    
- **Factors affecting reabsorption of glucose**
    - Glomerular filtration rate
        - **Effects of increasing and decreasing glomerular filtration rate renal threshold for glucose excretion**
            
            Increasing glomerular filtration rate (e.g. pregnancy/unilateral kidney) will cause a decrease in renal threshold for glucose excretion (<11 mmol/L)
            
            Decreasing glomerular filtration rate (e.g. chronic kidney disease) will cause an increase in renal threshold for glucose excretion (>11mol/L)
            
    - Plasma glucose level
        - **Effects of increase in plasma glucose level in renal threshold for glucose excretion**
            
            DM-induced hyperglycemia increases the expression of SGLT2 in tubular cells, causing an increase in tubular maximum re-absorptive capacity (TmG), thus renal threshold for glucose excretion increase
            
- Mechanism of glucose reabsorption
    - **Channels involved in glucose reabsorption on apical membrane and basolateral membrane**
        
        Apical membrane - SGLT transports glucose from lumen into tubular cells
        
        Basolateral membrane - GLUT transports glucose from tubular cells into blood
        
    - **Different channels involved in glucose reabsorption in different segment of proximal tubules**
        
        Across luminal membrane of tubular cells:
        
        Glucose is reabsorbed by SGLT2 in S1 and S2 segment of proximal tubules (account for >90% of glucose reabsorption) and SGLT1 in S3 segment (accounts for <10% of glucose reabsorption)
        
        Across basolateral membrane of tubular cells:
        
        Glucose is transported by GLUT2 in early segments and GLUT1 in late segments
        
- **Changes of tubular maximal re-absorptive capacity and renal threshold of glucose excretion in Type 2 diabetes mellitus**
    
    Hyperglycemia in T2DM causes an increase in expression of SGLT2, increasing tubular maximal reabsorptive capacity, thus increasing renal threshold for glucose excretion

        Due to increased renal threshold for glucose excretion, urine glucose test probably wonâ€™t show glucosuria
        

### Release of glucose into blood by gluconeogenesis

- **Difference in glucose metabolism between cortex and medulla**
    
    Medulla:
    
    Rich in enzymes for glycolysis, thus mainly carries out glycolysis
    
    Cortex:
    
    Rich in enzymes for gluconeogenesis, thus mainly carries out gluconeogenesis

- **Effects of insulin, catacholamine and glucagon on renal gluconeogenesis**
    
    Insulin - inhibits renal gluconeogesis
    
    Catacholamines - stimulates renal gluconeogenesis
    
    Glucagon - no direct effect
    
- Reciprocal hepatorenal release of glucose into blood in post-pranial and post-absorptive states
    - **Hepatorenal coordinations of glucose release in postprandial state**
        
        In postprandial state, liver gluconeogenesis is inhibited
        
        Liver takes in glucose for glycogenolysis, causing a decrease in blood glucose levels
        
        In response to decrease in blood glucose levels, renal gluconeogenesis occurs to maintain blood glucose level in postpranial state (accounting for 60% of glucose released into blood)

    - **Hepatorenal coordinations of glucose release in postabsorptive state**
        
        In postabsorptive state, hepatic glucose release dominates over renal glucose release:
        
        Liver accounts for 75-80% of glucose released into blood, by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
        
        Kidney accounts for 20-25% of glucose released into blood by gluconeogenesis

### Utilization of glucose from blood for energy

- Glutamine metabolism
    - **Amino acids used for gluconeogenesis in liver and kidneys**
        
        Liver - Alanine and Glutamine
        
        Kidney - Glutamine
        
    - **Fate of amino group and carbon skeleton of glutamine in kidneys**
        
        Glutamine undergoes deamination to give NH4+ and alpha-ketoglutarate
        
        Fate of alpha-ketoglutarate:
        
        Enters TCA cycle and is oxidised to give CO2 (for de novo HCO3- synthesis)
        
        Converted into glucose by gluconeogenesis
        
        Fate of NH4+:
        
        Secreted into tubular lumen to facilitate H+ secretion
        
    - **Synthesis of glutamine**
        
        Glutamate can be converted in the cytosol to glutamine
        
    - **Fate of glutamine in normal acid-base balance**
        
        In normal acid-base balance, most of glutamine in tubular lumen is reabsorbed into blood, rather than being catabolised
        
    - **Fate of glutamine in acidosis**
        
        In acidosis, glutamine catabolism predominates over reabsorption
        
        This enables de novo HCO3- synthesis and promotes H+ secretion
        
        Increased muscle release of glutamine in acidosis conditions contribute to substrate-induced increased gluconeogenesis
        
- **Effects of T2DM on release of glucose, utilization of glucose and reabsorption of glucose**
    
    All increase

    - **Factors causing increased renal gluconeogenesis in post-prandial state in T2DM**
        
        Impaired insulin release/insulin resistance removes inhibition on renal gluconeogenesis
        
        Substrate induced renal gluconeogenesis (Free fatty acids, lactate, glutamine, glutamate etc.)
        
    - **Factors causing increased renal gluconeogenesis in post absorptive in T2DM**
        
        Enzyme activation
        
    - **Factors causing increased renal gluconeogenesis in T2DM-induced ketoacidosis**
        
        In acidosis, glutamine catabolism predominants over reabsorption of glutamine due to increased glutamine release by muscles
        
        Hence, this will contribute to increased renal gluconeogenesis
