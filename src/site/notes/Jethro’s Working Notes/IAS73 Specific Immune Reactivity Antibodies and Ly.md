### Adaptive Immunity

- What is an adaptive immune response?
    
    Adaptive immune response is an immune response that targets, 'memorizes' and mounts antigen-specific action, it includes humoral response and cell-mediated (cellular) response
    
- What are the effector cells in specific immunity?
    
    B lymphocytes - involved in humoral response
    
    T lymphocytes - involved in cell-mediated response
    
- Describe the locations for development of effector cells in specific immunity.
    
    Primary Lymphoid organs (Thymus, bone marrow):
    
    For development and maturation of lymphocytes from their precursor cells (haematopoietic stem cells)
    
    Secondary lymphoid organs (Spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer's patches in small inetestine):
    
    For lymphocytes to interact with antigen and accessory cells, and eventual differential lymphocytes into effector cells
    
- What are the characteristics of adaptive immunity?
    
    Specificity (Antigen specific) - Lymphocytes have antigen binding receptors for recognition
    
    Diversity (Diverse repertoire) - Antigen receptors must be sufficiently diverse to recognize and differentiate between many pathogens
    
    Memory (Immunological memory) - Able to 'memorize' the pathogen and mount a better response
    
    Self and non-self discrimination - To avoid autoimmune response
    

### Humoral Response

- What is humoral response?
    
    Humoral response - Adaptive immune response that protects against extracellular microbes, toxins, mediated by B lymphocytes and their specific products, antibodies/immunoglobin
    
- Describe the process of B lymphopoeisis.
    
    Haematopoietic stem cells develop and mature into B lymphocytes with antigen receptors in the bone marrow
    
    The mature B lymphocyte circulates in the blood and lymphatics, and recognizes antigens in secondary lymphoid organs, causing them to differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, and memory cells to 'memorize' the antigen to mount a better secondary response upon subsequent encounter of the same antigen
    
- What is the basic structure of an Immunoglobin (Ig)/Antibody (Ab)?
    
    Y-shaped protein consisting of of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains linked by disulphide bridges
    
    Consist of 2 Variable (Fab) region:
    
    Sequence is highly variable between antibodies even within the same isotype
    
    Fab region is for antigen binding (2 bind sites per Ab)
    
    Variations if Fab region allows for different immunoglobin to bind to different epitope on different antigen, thus making the adaptive response antigen specific
    
    Consist of 1 Constant (Fc) region:
    
    Sequence is constant within the same isotype, but varies between different isotypes
    
    Fc region is for interacting with other immune components
    
    Variations in Fc region determines the interaction with different immune components leading to different biological events
    
- What are the five major isotypes of Antibody? How do they vary?
    
    IgG, IgM, IgD, IgA, IgE, they vary in the Fc region
    
    All are soluble except IgD
    
    IgA can form a dimer
    
    IgM can form a pentamer
    
    IgM and IgD are membrane bound
    
- What are the characteristics of antibodies in terms of their Fab regions?
    
    Antibodies can recognize the epitope (antigenic determinants) of antigens
    
    Different antibodies have different variable regions which recognize different epitopes in different antigen, making the response Antigen specific
    
    Human B cells can produce 10^8 antigen-specific variable regions, producing a diverse repertoire
    
- What are the functions of antibodies?
    1. Neutralization of microbes and toxins
        
        By agglutination of microbes and precipitation of dissolved antigen
        
        Made possible as an antibody has two bind sites
        
    2. Opsonization and phagocytosis of microbes
        
        Macrophages except Fcgamma receptors for Fc region of IgG
        
        Binding of IgG to microbe opsonised the microbe, in which Fc of IgG binds to Fc receptor on phagocyte to trigger phagocytosis
        
    3. Complement activation
        
        Antigen-antibody complex triggers complement activation via the classical pathway
        
        Effects of comment activation include:
        
        1. Bacterial Lysis by formation of MAC
        2. Phagocytosis by microbes opsonised by complement fragments
        3. Induce inflammationâ€œ
    4. Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
        
        Cytotoxic NK cells and eisinophils pocess Fc receptors to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
        
- Elaborate on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
    
    NK cells express Fc receptors for binding to Fc region of IgG
    
    When IgG binds to antigen on a microbe, the Fc region on IgG binds to Fc receptor on NK cells, recruiting NK cells by mediating NK lysis by release of cytotoxic granules containing granzymes and perforin
    
    Eosinophils express Fc receptors for binding to Fc region of IgE
    
    When IgE binds to antigen on helminth, Fc region of IgE binds to Fc receptor on Eosinophils, recruiting Eosinophils to release cytotoxic granules to kill helminth
    

### Cell-Mediated Response

- What is cell-mediated response?
    
    Cell-mediated response is an adaptive immune response that acts against intracellular microbes, mediated by T cells
    
- Describe the process of T lymphopoiesis.
    
    Haematopoietic stem cell is forms T cell in the bone marrow, in which T cells mature in the thymus by producing T cell receptors and circulate in blood and lymphatics
    
    In secondary lymphoid organs, mature T cells recognize antigens, some are activated to become effector T cells, while some develop into memory cells
    
- What is the structure of T cell receptor?
    
    T cell receptors only exist in membrane bound form on T cells
    
    It generally consist of two chains, the alpha and beta chain (more than 95% of T cells)
    
    It only consist of one single variable antigen binding site

- How do T cell receptors recognize antigens?
    
    TCR always complex with a CD3 complex and a co-receptor, in which the co-receptor type depends type of T cell, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells
    
    Antigen binding is aided by the co-receptor, either CD4 or CD8
    
    TCR recognize epitope presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I or class II, on antigen presenting cells
    
- What are the two distinct cell lineages of T cells?
    
    CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells
    
- Describe the activation and function of CD8+ T cells.
    
    CD8+ T cells (Killer T cells/ Cytotoxic T cells), is activated by recognizing epitope presented by MHC class I molecules on antigen-presenting cells
    
    Activated CD8+ T cells develop cytotoxic granules to kill microbe infected cell
    
    Activated CD8+ T cells recognize target cells (virus infected cells) via TCR binding to epitope on MHC class 1 molecule on target  cells in which they will release cytotoxic granules
    
    Cytotoxic granules contain perforins (pore-forming), and granzymes (induce apoptosis)
    
    Perforins form pores in infected cells to allow entry of granzymes to induce apoptosis in targeted cells
    
- Describe the activation and function of CD4+ T cells.
    
    CD4+ T cells (Helper T cells) is activated by recognizing epitope presented by MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells
    
    Activated CD4+ T cells express additional surface proteins and cytokines for helper functions
    
    Activated CD4+ T cells express additional surface CD40 ligand (CD40L) that engages CD40 on macrophages or B cells to activate them by cell cell contact
    
    B cells antigen production also depend on cytokines such as IL-4 and TGF-beta
    
    Activated CD4+ T cells produces a variety of cytokines, namely IFN-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta, lymphotoxin, and interleukins
    
    CD4+ T cells is classified by the types of cytokines produced:
    
    Th1: IFN-gamma
    
    Th2: IL-4
    
    Th17: IL-17
    
    Cytokines released by CD4+ T cells can also modulate the proliferation and development of CD4+ T cells (IL-2)
    

### Clonal Selection Theory of Lymphocytes

- Describe the process of development of humoral response.
    
    BCR of the same B cell has the same antigen specificity
    
    Different B cells have different antigen specificity
    
    Antigens will select the B cell with the right specificity for clonal expansion, such that antibodies produced from plasma cells and memory cells have the same antigen specificity as the original B cell
    
- Describe the process of development of cellular response.
    
    TCR of the same T cell has the same antigen specificity
    
    Different T cells have different antigen specificity 
    
    Antigen will select the T cell with the right specificity for clonal expansion, such that TCR on the effector T cells and memory T cells will have the same antigen specificity as the original T cell
    
- Where does induction of adaptive immune response occur?
    
    Secondary lymphoid organs
    
- Describe the three phases of induction of specific immune response.
    
    Ag recognition (Ag select right B/T cell for clonal expansion)
    
    Activation (Clonal expansion and differentiation of B/T cells with right specificity)
    
    Reaction/Effector (Occurs at the site of infection, around 10 to 14 days after encounter of Ag)
    
    Surviving memory lymphocytes circulate in body and can readily mount an Ag-specific response upon subsequent exposure to the same antigen
    
- What are the characteristics of secondary response when compared to primary response?
    
    Faster - Shorter activation/lag phase
    
    Stronger - Greater magnitude of reaction due to qualitative (Better antibodies) and quantitative (More antibodies and T cells)
    
    Long lasting - Slower decline after reaction phase
    
- What is the function of self and non-self discrimination?
    
    To minimize autoimmunity
    
- How is self-tolerance induced?
    
    Central tolerance - Deletion (apoptosis) of self-reactive lymphocytes during lymphopoiesis in primary lymphoid organs
    
    Peripheral tolerance - Deletion (apoptosis), inactivation (anergy) and suppression of self-reactive lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs
