### Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB)

Neuromuscular blocking agents are a group of drugs used to inhibit neurotransmission across Neuromusclar junction ([[Neuromuscular junction is highly specialised in terms of its physiological anatomy\|Neuromuscular junction is highly specialised in terms of its physiological anatomy]]).

- ******Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents******
    
    Neuromuscular blocking agents are used in:
    
    - Surgery as part of general anaesthesia
    - Rapid induction sequence - As a laryngeal muscle relaxation to secure the airway in a short sequence of time
    - Critical care - In ARDS (preventing patients from fighting ventilatory apparatus), In raised intracranial pressure (to sedate patient), In therapeutic hypothermia (to prevent shivering).

- ********************************************Safe monitoring of NMB********************************************
    
    Safe monitoring of NMB is required to avoid prolonged paralysis and accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA).
    
    Prolongeed paralysis is avoided by monitoring peripheral nerve stimulator.
    
    Accidental awareness is avoided by monitoring minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) for volantile anaesthesia, and Bispectral Index (BIS) for both IV and volantile anaesthesia.
