### Anterior tibial artery

The anterior tibial artery is a branch of the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Popliteal artery\|Popliteal artery]] as it crosses the inferior border of the popliteus.

- ********************In the leg********************
    
    It accesses the anterior compartment of the leg superior to the interosseus membrane, and descends along the anterior compartment of the leg, deep to the extensor digitorum longus, similar to the [[deep fibular [[nerve\|deep fibular [[nerve]]]].
