### Anterior tibial artery

The anterior tibial artery is a branch of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Popliteal artery\|Popliteal artery]] as it crosses the inferior border of the popliteus.

- ********************In the leg********************
    
    It accesses the anterior compartment of the leg superior to the interosseus membrane, and descends along the anterior compartment of the leg, deep to the extensor digitorum longus, similar to the [[deep fibular [[nerve\|deep fibular [[nerve]]]].

- ******************************************In the ankle and foot******************************************
    
    As it crosses the ankle joint, it is renamed as the *dorsalis pedis artery,* which courses lateral to the extensor haullicus longus tendon and gives the arcuate artery.
