    Classified by catalase test
    
    Catalase+ve - staphylococcus
    
    Catalase-ve - streptococcus
    
- **Classification of catalase negative aerobic gram positive cocci**
    
    Classified by appearance on blood agar - beta-haemolytic, alpha-haemolytic, gamma-haemolytic
    
    Beta-haemolytic - Further classified by lancefield grouping by bacitracin susceptibility and biochemical reactions
    
    Alpha and gamma-haemolytic - Further classified by optochin suceptibility and bile solubility

                Eosinophilia
                
                Associated with pharyngitis, but can follow any GAS infection
                
        - Skin and soft tissue infection - impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotising faciitis, myonecrosis, myositis
            
            Impetigo - infection of epidermis, involving formations of vesicles, pustules and crusts
            
            Erysipelas, cellulitis - infection of dermis
            
            Necrotising fasciitis, myonecrosis - infection of fascia and muscles
            
        - Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome
            - **Diagnostic criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome**
                
                Diagnosis made by laboratory criteria or clinical criteria
                
                Laboratory criteria - Isolated GAS
                
                Clinical criteria - Hypotension with ≥ 2 multiorgan involvement
                
                Renal impairment

                This results in release of cytokines that eventually result in shock

        - Bacteremia
    - **Microbial diagnosis of GAS**
        1. Culture
            
            From blood and site of infection (skin swab, throat swab, tissue culture)
            
        2. Antigen detection test
        3. Serology (for anti-streptolysin O)
            
            Not useful for acute phase
            
    - **Treatment of GAS**
        
        Penicillin or similar antibiotics
        
        Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome - add clindamycin or linezolid to inhibit toxin production
        
        High resistance for clindamycin and erythromycin in Hong Kong, hence in Hong Kong, recommend linezolid and penicillin for toxic shock syndrome
        
    - **Non-suppurative complications of GAS**
        - Acute rheumatic fever
            
            
            - **What is acute rheumatic fever?**
                
                Acute rheumatic fever is the valvular damage caused by Type II hypersensitvity response to GAS infection
                
            - **Epidemiology of acute rheumatic fever**
                
                Leading cause of heart failure in children/young adults in developing countries
                
                Most frequent age group: 5-15 years old
                
                A delayed sequelae of GAS pharyngitis or skin infection (rarely)
                
            - **Occurence and latency of acute rheumatic fever**
                
                A delayed sequelae of GAS pharyngitis or skin infection (rarely)
                
                Latency: usually 3 weeks (1-5 weeks)
                
            - **Pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever**
                
                Molecular mimicry - due to similar structure of streptococcal M protein and myosin, resulting in immunity directed towards myosin
                
            - **Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever**
                
                Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is made based on serologic evidence of previous streptococcal infection in conjunction with Jones criteria: which requires 2 major criteria or 1 major criteria and 2 minor criteria
                
                Major criteria:
                
                Migratory polyarthritis, carditis (valvulitis, pericarditis, myocarditis), subcutaneous nodules (on surface of joint and spine), erythema marginatum, Sydenham’s chorea (involuntary movement, muscle weakness, emotional instability)
