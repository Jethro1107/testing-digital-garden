### Sternoclavicular joint

The sternoclavicular joint is the joint that connects the sternal end of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clavicle\|Clavicle]]  to the clavicular notch of the manubrium of the sternum.

The sternoclavicular joint is the only joint that connects the pectorial girdle to the axial skeleton.

Within the joint capsule, a fibrocartilage (articular disc) completely separates the joint cavity into two compartment, with its superior attachment to the sternal end of the clavicle, and its inferior attachment to the 1st costal cartilage.

- **Classification of the sternoclavicular joint**
    
    The sternoclavicular joint is classified as a synovial saddle joint, or a double plane joint.
    
- **Stabilization of the sternoclavicular joint**
    
    The sternoclavicular joint is surrounded by a joint capsule, but is stabilized by several ligaments.
    
    The anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments (intrinsic ligaments) are thickened parts of the joint capsule, present anteriorly and posteriorly of the joint respectively.
    
    The interclavicular ligament (extrinsic ligament) connects the two joint capsules, occupying the jugular notch of the manubrium.
    
    The costoclavicular ligament attaches superiorly to the to the costal tubercle of the clavicle and the attaches inferiorly to the 1st costal cartilage.
    
    The aforementioned ligaments still render the sternoclavicular joint rather weak. *The articular disc within the joint capsule actually provides much of the stabilization of the sternoclavicular joint.*

- **Movement of the sternoclavicular joint**
    
    The sternoclavicular joint enables movement of the clavicle:
    
    - Front and back (in an anterior-posterior plane)
    - Up and down (in a verticle plane)
    - A limited degree of rotation
