### Cartilage

Cartilage is a specialised connective tissue consisting of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cartilage matrix\|Cartilage matrix]] and chondrocytes.

- **************************************************************************************************There are 5 zones of articular cartilage**************************************************************************************************
    1. Gliding zone - Where chondrocytes are arranged parallel to articular surface.
    2. Transitional zones - Where chondrocytes are stacked on top of each other
    3. Tidemark - Which separates the non-calcified and calcified cartilage
    4. Zone of calcified cartilage - Consisting of death of loss of chondrocytes and calcified cartilage (purple)
    5. Subchondral bone

Cartilage is avascular, but chondrocytes require nutrients to maintain [[Jethro’s Working Notes/ECM homeostasis\|ECM homeostasis]].
