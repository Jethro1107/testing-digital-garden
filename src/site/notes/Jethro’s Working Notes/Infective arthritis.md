### Infective arthritis

Infective arthritis is the infection of the joint, which is usually acute, and monoarticular (90%), and rarely polyarticular (10%).

- **************************************************************Etiology of infective arthritis**************************************************************
    
    Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen causing infective arthritis.
    
    Neisseria gonorrhoeae should be considered if there is polyarticular involvement.
    
- **********************************************************************************Route of infection of infective arthritis**********************************************************************************
    
    Haematogenous spread is the most common route of spread.
    
    Direct innoculation into joints through surgery, trauma and bite wounds is also possible.
    
    Rarely, there is contiguous spread from adjacent infected soft tissue or bone ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Osteomyelitis\|Osteomyelitis]]).
    
- **********************************************************************Pathogenesis of infective arthritis**********************************************************************
    
    Intra-articular inflammation results in the destruction of articular cartilage.
    
- ********************************************************************************Clinical features of infective arthritis********************************************************************************
    
    Acute joint symptoms develop: with pain, soft tissue swelling, redness, and warmth of the joint (the cardinal signs of inflammation), and limited range of motion.
    
    There may be also systemic manifestation, such as fever and leukocytosis.
    
- ****************************************************************Etiological diagnosis of infective arthritis****************************************************************
    
    Blood culture
    
    Synovial fluid analysis reveal high white cell count, and presence of microbe on gram stain and culture.
    
    Synovial biopsy, which is rarely performed.
