### Neuromuscular junction is highly specialised in terms of its physiological anatomy

The neuromuscular junction is a peripheral chemical synapse between the motor neuron and the muscle fibre. 

The general physiological anatomy of neuromuscular junction includes:

- Presynaptic terminal (the axonal terminal of the motor neuron) - It consist of acetylcholine-filled synaptic vesicles at the active zones.
- Synaptic cleft
- Postsynaptic terminal (the membrane of the muscle fibres)
    
    The postsynaptic membrane consist of junctional folds that consist of acetylcholine receptors clusters (AChR clusters), which are ligand-gated cation channels that enable action potential generation on the muscle fibre.
    

Acetylcholine is the chosen neurotransmitter for the neuromuscular junction, such that enzymes must be present in the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminal to enable the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Synthesis and degradation of acetylcholine\|Synthesis and degradation of acetylcholine]].

There must be precise alignment of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal and the AChR at the junctional folds of the postsynaptic terminal for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction\|Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction]], which can be carried out by: [[Innervation inducts AChR clustering at junctional folds\|Innervation inducts AChR clustering at junctional folds]].
