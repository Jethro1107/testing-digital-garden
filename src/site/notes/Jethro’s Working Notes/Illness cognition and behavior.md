- May concern the difference between [[disease and illness\|disease and illness]]

- Illness cognition
    - Illness cognition is the common sense belief of their own illness
    - There are 5 components of illness cognition
        - Identity of disease (name, and associated symptoms)
        - Perceived cause of disease (may draw on multiple causal models)
        - Timeline of disease (acute vs chronic) ([[The general public has a poor concept of chronic diseases\|The general public has a poor concept of chronic diseases]])
        - Consequences of disease on their life
        - Curability or controllability (curable? controlled by who? Internal or external locus of control)

- Illness behavior
    - What is illness behavior?
        - Illness behavior is the action taken in response to signs and symptoms of an illness.
        - Health seeking behavior is a form of illness behavior
    - Leventhal's self-regulatory model of illness behavior illustrates the relationship in which illness perception may affect illness behavior
        - In the self-regulatory model of illness behavior, an assumption is made: When facing a problem, an individual will be motivate to solve the problem and re-establish a sense of normalcy
        - There are three steps to the self-regulatory model of illness behavior, triggered by a situation stimuli (e.g symptoms of illness)
            - Interpretation (making sense of a problem, or establishing [[illness cognition\|illness cognition]], or an emotional response to the illness)
            - Coping (Approach coping or avoidance coping)
            - Appraisal of the coping strategy
    - A type of illness behavior is help-seeking behavior
        - Whether an individual is going to engage in help-seeking behavior is largely dependent on two factors: Illness recognition (associated with the identity of disease) and illness danger.
