### Carpometacarpal joint of the thumb

Unlike the carpometacarpal joint for the other digits, which are hinge joints, the carpometacarpal joint actually operates independently as a synovial saddle joint.

- **Movements of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb**
    The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb enables:
    - Flexion and extension
    - Abduction and adduction
    - Rotation
    
    This enables opposition of the thumb with the other digits, which requires a combination of abduction, flexion and medial rotation.
