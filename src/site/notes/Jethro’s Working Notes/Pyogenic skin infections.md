### Pyogenic skin infections

Pyogenic skin infections include 5 groups: Pyoderma, which include impetigo and folliculitis, cellulitis, erysipelas, and skin absess (which include furuncle and carbuncle).

### Pyoderma

Pyoderma, literally means pus in the skin. There are 2 types of pyoderma: impetigo and folliculitis.

- ****************Impetigo****************
    
    Impetigo is a superficial, ***************intra-epidermal*************** unilocular vesicopustule (a collection of pus in the epidermal layer of the skin).
    
    - ********************************************************Clinical feature of impetigo********************************************************
        
        Classically, it develops as papules that form vesicles surrounded by erythema. The pus-filled vesicles then break down to form *******************golden yellow crust*******************, the defining feature of impetigo.

    - ************************************************Epidemiology of impetigo************************************************
        
        It is transmitted by contact transmission, and is quite infective.
        
        Hence, it commonly affects children (but also contact sports players).
        
    - ************************************************************Common etiological agents of impetigo************************************************************
        
        It is usually caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, or is mixed.
        
- ************************Folliculitis************************
    
    Folliculitis is the abscess formation around hair follicles.
    
    - ********Clinical features of folliculitis********
        
        It involves collection of pus involving a hair follicle, with hair passing through the lesion.

### Cellulitis

Cellulitis is an acute spreading infection involving the dermis, that extends into the subcutaneous tissue.

- **************************************************************Clinical features of cellulitis**************************************************************
    
    There are local signs of inflammation.
    
    The lesion has ill-defined margins (due to its deep location).
    
    There may or may not be local abscesses.
    
    Other systemic manifestations include fever, chills, and bacteremia.
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
- ********************************************Etiology of cellulitis********************************************
    
    Cellulitis is commonly caused by:
    
    - Beta-haemolytic streptococci (particularly Streptococcus pyogenes, GAS)
    - Staphylococcus aureus
    - Rarely, other bacteria

### Erysipelas

Erysipelas is a type of cellulitis, involving infection of the upper dermis and epidermis.

- **********************************************Clinical features of erysipelas**********************************************
    
    Erysipelas classically affects the face, but mostly affects the lower limb now.
    
    It is characterised with local signs of inflammation, where the lesion has well-defined borders.
    
- ****************************Etiology of erysipelas****************************
    
    Erysipelas is commonly caused by beta haemolytic streptococci (commonly GAS).
    

### Skin abscess

Furuncle and carbuncle are abscesses found in deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, that may have spread from the hair follicles.

A furuncle involves a single hair follicle.

When multiple furuncle coalesce, it results in a carbuncle.

- ****************************************Etiology of skin abscess****************************************
    
    It is commonly caused by:
    
    - Staphylococcus aureus
    - Beta-haemolytic streptococci is also capable of causing skin abscess
