### Chondrocyte differentiation requires activation of SOX9

Chondrocyte differentiation requires activation of SOX9 (SRY-related HMG (high mobility group) box (DNA binding region) genes, in conjunction with SOX5/6.

 SOX9 regulates the expression of chondrocyte specific genes, genes required for synthesis of cartilage matrix, such as collagen II, IX and XI and aggrecan.
