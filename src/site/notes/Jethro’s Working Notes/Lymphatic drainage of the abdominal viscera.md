### Lymphatic drainage of the abdominal viscera

Foregut derivatives (stomach, liver and proximal half of descending part of duodenum) drains into celiac lymph nodes.

Midgut derivatives (Rest of the small intestine, cecum with appendix, accending colon, and proximal 2/3 of transverse colon) drains into superior mesenteric lymph nodes.

Hindgut derivatives (rest of large intestine and rectum) drains into inferior mesenteric lymph node.

The celiac lymph nodes and superior mesenteric lymph node drains into the cisterna chyli via the intestinal trunk, whereas the inferior mesenteric lymph node drains into the cisterna chyli via the left lumbar trunk.

The cisterna chyli is a dilated portion of the lymphatic system just beneath the diaphragm, which drains into the thoracic duct.
