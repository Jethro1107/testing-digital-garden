### Intestinal obstruction

- **What is intestinal obstruction?**
    
    Intestinal obstruction is defined as *any obstruction at any level of the small or large bowel*. However, it is *commonly seen in the small bowel due to its relatively narrow lumen.*
    
    Intestinal obstruction may be mechanical or functional (paralytic ileus).
    
- **Four causes account for around 80% of intestinal obstructions:**
    
    Hernias - Protrusion of abdominal contents into an oriface (inguinal canal, femoral canal or umbilicus), or at any weakness of abdominal wall (acquired via surgical scars).
    
    Adhesions - Fibrous bands acquired from previous surgery between two bowel segments. This creates a closed loop where other viscera may slide and become entrapped (an internal herniation).
    
    Volvulus - Intestinal twisting at their mesenteric point, resulting in obstruction and strangulation (*a luminal and vascular comprimise*). Most commonly, sigmoid volvulus, and less commonly, cecal volvulus.
    
    Intussusception - A segment of bowel constricts via a peristaltic wave and slides into the immediately distal segment. After insertion, peristaltic waves in the invaginated segment further pushes it inwards, pulling the mesentery along. This results in obstruction, and compromise the messenteric vasculature.

- **Clinical features (signs and symptoms) of intestinal obstruction**
    
    Clinical features of intestinal obstruction include:
    
    - Absolute constipation with no defecation or passage of flatus (usually in cases of complete obstruction).
    - Abdominal distension - caused by distension of the bowel. Peristalsis may be visible on the abdominal wall.
    - Colicky pain - Paroxysm of cramps that comes in waves that is caused by intense peristalsis.
    - Nausea and vomiting - Often a result of duodenal and upper jejunal (proximal small intestinal) obstruction.
- **Diagnosis of intestinal obstruction requires physical examination and imaging:**
    
    On physical examination:
    
    1. Hernia may be visible.
    2. Abdominal distension with visible peristaltic waves.
    3. Hyperactive bowel sounds.
    
    On Abdominal X-ray:
    
    1. Dilated bowel loops on supine abdominal X-ray.
    2. Fluid levels on erect abdominal X-ray.
    3. Contrast follow through may delineate level of obstruction.
    
    Sigmoid volvulus is almost always visible on X-ray.
    
    If intraluminal mass is suspected, CT scan is indicated.
    
- **Complications of intestinal obstruction**
    
    *Intestinal obstruction may result in infarction and perforation of the bowel.* The bowel segment proximal to the intestine becomes increasingly **distended by fluids and gas**, causing an increased intraluminal pressure that **compress in mural blood vessels** (*This is especially common in closed-loop obstructions*). This results in ischemia (hence, intestinal obstruction is a cause of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ischaemic bowel disease\|Ischaemic bowel disease]]), infarction and eventually perforation. Intestinal perforation causes the leakage of gut microbiota into the normally sterile peritoneal cavity resulting in acute peritonitis, a life threatening condition.
    
    Distended bowel segments will also excrete fluids and electrolytes, resulting in shock and electrolyte imbalance.
