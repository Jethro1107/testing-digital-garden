### Fluid secretion by crypt cells is mediated by a Cl- dependent mechanism

Crypt cells of the [[Crypts of Lieburkuhn (intestinal [[glands)\|Crypts of Lieburkuhn (intestinal [[glands)]]]] mediate fluid secretion by a Cl- dependent mechanism.

Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pumps out 3 Na+ and pumps in 2 K+ at the expense of 1 ATP.

Basolateral NKCC channels pump in 1 Na+, 1 K+ and 2 Cl- down the Na+ gradient.

As intracellular Cl- levels builds up, apical CFTR and TMEM16A (Ca2+-activated Cl- channels) pump out Cl- into the intestinal lumen.

Active Cl- secretion creates a negative potential and osmotic gradient that drives diffusion and osmosis of Na+ and water into the intestinal lumen.

- **Fluid secretion is regulated by secretagogues**
    
    ACh released by cholinergic nerve fibres results in an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, activating Ca2+-activated Cl- channels.
    
    Secretin released by S cells of the mucosa of the duodenum and the jejunum, results in an increase in cAMP levels, activating CFTR.
