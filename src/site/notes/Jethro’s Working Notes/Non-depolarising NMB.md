### Non-depolarising NMB

A class of [[Neuromuscular blocking agents [[(NMB)\|Neuromuscular blocking agents [[(NMB)]]]].

- ******************************************************************************************Classification and examples of non-depolarising NMB******************************************************************************************
    
    Non-depolarising NMB can be classified by duration of action:
    
    - Short acting - Mivacurium
    - Intermediate acting - Atracurium, Cis-atracurium, Rocuronium, Vecuronium
    - Long acting - Tubocurarine, Doxacurium, Pancuronium, Pipercuronium
    
    They can also be classified by chemical structures:

    Note that the most commonly used non-depolarising NMB are:
    
    - Atracurium, Cis-atracurium, Rocuronium
- ******************************************************MOA of non-depolarising NMB******************************************************
    
    Non-depolarising NMB serves as competitive antagonists of nicotinic AChR in neuromuscular junction.
    
    It competitively binds to AChR, without activating the ligand-gated cation channel, preventing binding of ACh.
    
    This prevents depolarization, thus enabling muscle relaxation.
    
- ********************************************************************************Pharmacokinetics of non-depolarising NMB********************************************************************************
    
    Atracurium:
    
    - Atracurium has a relatively slow onset of action (90-120s).
    - It has a intermediate acting (30-40 minutes).
    - Its action terminates when it diffuses out from the NMJ, and is metabolised.
    - They are metabolised by ester hydrolysis and Hoffman elimination (increase elimination at higher temperatures).
    
    Rocuronium:
    
    - It has a relatively faster onset of action (45-60s).
    - It is also intermediate acting (30-45 minutes).
    - It has lower potency.
    - It is not metabolised and undergoes direct biliary excretion.
- **********************************************************Clinical use of non-depolarizing NMB**********************************************************
    
    They are usually used for:
    
    - [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Rapid sequence induction\|Rapid sequence induction]]
    - Surgery
- ****************************************************************Reversal of non-depolarising NMB****************************************************************
    
    Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors:
    
    - Neostigmine (Parenteral), Pyridostigmine (Oral, also used for the treatment of mild Myasthesia gravis)
    - It inhibits AChE within the NMJ, enabling ACh to remain with the synaptic cleft for a longer time.
    
    Sugammadex:
    
    - A reversal agent for rocuronium only.
    - It is a ring-like structure that encapsulates rocuronium, forming an inactive water-soluble complex, which is excreted by the kidneys, thus reversing action of rocuronium,
