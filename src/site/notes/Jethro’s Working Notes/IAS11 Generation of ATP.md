# Define the Molecule

- **Learning Outcomes**
    
    Define bioenergetics
    
    Relate the molecular structure of ATP to its high energy storage
    
    Explain how energy is stored in or transferred from ATP
    
- **Defining Bioenergetics**
    - Definition
        
        Bioenergetics is the branch of biochemistry that focuses on how cells transform energies by producing, storing and consuming ATP
        
    - 3 Phase of Energy Transformation
        
        Phase 1 - Breakdown of macronutrients, namely carbohydrates and lipids
        
        Phase 2 - Conversion of chemical energy from macronutrients into phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP
        
        Phase 3 - Breakdown of phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP to drive energy-required processes in cells
        
- **The Molecular structure of ATP and its high energy storage**
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    Adenosine triphosphate - contains a nitrogen containing base, a pentose, and 3 phosphate groups
    
    2 phosphate groups maintained by high energy phosphoanhydride bonds ⇒ unstable, reactive with respect to hydrolysis
    
- **Storage and Transfer of Energy in ATP**
    
    ATP ↔ ADP+Pi ↔ AMP+2Pi
    

# Synthesis of ATP

- **Learning Outcomes**
    
    Identify and compare the various molecular pathways involved in the synthesis of ATP
    
    Explain the function of ATP synthase and how it converts ADP to ATP in the mitochondria
    
- **Glycolysis**
    
    Occurs in the cytosol of the cell
    
    In investment phase, 2 ATP is consumed for the breakdown of glucose and F-6-P
    
    In payoff phase, Glucose is broken down into 2 pyruvate molecules, 2 NADH and 4 ATP
    
    Net formation of 2 ATP
    
- **Conversion of pyruvate into Acetyl-CoA**
    
    2 Pyruvate converted int 2 acetyl-CoA molecule by pyruvate dehydrogenase, yielding 2 NADH
    
- **TCA cycle**
    
    Occurs in inner mitochondrial membrane
    
    1 Acetyl-CoA can yield 1 ATP, 1 GTP, 3NADH, 1FADH2,2 CO2 and 3 H+
    
    2 acetyl-CoA generated from 2 pyruvate formed from glycolysis, so the sum of such molecules yielded in the TCA cycle includes: 
    
    2 ATP, 2 GTP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, 4 CO2 and 6 H+
    
    Purpose of TCA cycle is to convert pyruvate into reduced electron carriers (NADH, FADH2) that can be fed into the Electron transport chain to yield more ATP
    
- **Electron Transport Chain**
    
    ETC - A series of complexes that carry out redox reactions, couples electron transfer and proton transfer within the inner mitochondrial membrane to create a pH gradient and an electrical potential across the membrane 
    
- **ATP Synthase**
    
    ATP synthase is a channel (not a proton pump) located on the inner mitochondrial membrane
    
    - Anatomy of ATP synthase
        
        ![[2DE68581-DC15-4BA8-9385-55ED9C9DB3AB.jpeg\|2DE68581-DC15-4BA8-9385-55ED9C9DB3AB.jpeg]]
        
        F1 unit - located within mitochondrial matrix, consisting of alpha, beta and gamma subunit
        
        F0 unit - located in the intermembrane space, consisting of the c ring, which spins
        
        C ring spins as protons move through ATP synthase down the proton gradient, generating electrical energy to synthesise ATP
        
    - Conformation of F1 unit relating to its action
        
        ![[CD3B0994-6ECC-4275-9389-26CD70693166.jpeg\|CD3B0994-6ECC-4275-9389-26CD70693166.jpeg]]
        
        Alpha and beta subunits form the catalytic complex, where alpha is regulatory and beta is catalytic, and directly engaging with the gamma subunit
        
        Rotation of gamma subunit, due to the rotation of the F0 motor, results in the conformational change of the beta subunit: L → T → O
        
        Loose state (L) - Allows ADP and P to bind loosely
        
        Tight state (T) - Compresses ADP and P to catalyse the formation of ATP
        
        Open state (O) - Allows finished ATP to leave and ADP + P to enter
        

# Functional role of ATP

- **Learning Outcomes**
    
    Explain the role of ATP in muscle contractions
    
    Describe a number of physiological processes in the human body that utilize ATP
    
- **As an Energy Source**
    - **Active Transport**
        
        e.g Active Transport of Na+ and K+ in neurons against conc. gradient
        
    - **Biosynthesis / Reaction Coupling**
        
        De novo synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates for assembly of DNA & RNA
        
        Attachment of tRNA to amino acids for protein synthesis, requiring enzyme Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesase and ATP
        
    - **Muscle Contraction**
        - Anatomy of Sarcomere
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Sarcomere - Basic contractile unit of muscle fibre, with two types of protein filaments: actin and myosin
            
            Actin consist of tropomyosin, with troponin attached
            
            ATP is required for the power strokes. which pull actin towards Z disks during muscle contraction
            
        - Skeletal Muscle Contraction
            
            In relaxed state, tropomyosin blocks the myosin binding site on the actin
            
            When the motor neuron fires an active potential, Ca2+ binds to troponin on tropomyosin, resulting in the conformational change of tropomyosin, which moves away from the myosin binding site
            
            Myosin ATPase hydrolyse ATP on myosin heads, forming ADP + P
            
            Cross bridge formation - Myosin heads attach to the myosin binding sites on actin, and P is released
            
            Power stroke (actual muscle contraction movement) - Myosin cross bridges bend to slide actin towards Z disk, and ADP is released
            
            New ATP minds to myosin heads to detach myosin heads from actin and the muscle relaxes
            
            Rigor Mortis (dead muscles tense up) - No ATP formed to bind to myosin head for muscle relaxation
            
        - Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+ ATPase in cardiomyocytes
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR) is a specialised type of Endoplasmic Reticulum for Ca2+ storage
            
            1. When muscle is stimulated, a voltage gated L-type calcium channels (LTCC) on cell surface opens
            2. Small amount of Calcium influx is allowed from outside the cell, which induces the opening of ryanodine receptor (RYR), causing the SR to release large amounts of Ca2+
            3. Ca2+ binds to troponin to initiate the muscle contraction cascade
            4. Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) use ATP to transfer Ca2+ from cytosol back to the lumen of SR
- **Phosphorylation**
    
    Source of phosphate group for protein phosphorylation, most common post-translational modification to activate or deactivate a protein
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
- **Extracellular Signalling**
    - Carotid body in the control of breathing
        
        Contains cluster of chemoreceptor cells called glomus cells, which detect O2, , CO2 and pH levels of the blood
        
        Sense hypoxia → ATP released by vesicular exocytosis → Intercellular signaling between glomus cell and carotid sinus nerve → signal medulla oblongata → breathe faster and deeper
        
    - ATP-induced blood vessel dilation
        
        Hypoxia → Endothelial cells release ATP by vesicular exocytosis → induce synthesis of nitric oxide → blood vessel dilation
        
    - ATP-induced inflammation, wound healing and clearance
        
        Upon cell damage or cell stress, ATP is released by dead cells:
        
        1. Binding of ATP to P2X receptors (ion channels), allows Na+, K+, and Mg2+ to flow along the gradient, activation of inflammation, tumor and bacterial killing
        2. Binding of ATP to P2Y receptors trigger a whole cascade of signalling which results in inflammation and wound healing
        3. ATP acts as recruiters to the site of damage, promoting the clearance of dead cells
    - Gustatory (taste) receptor signaling
        - Some taste receptors use ATP as extracellular signaling molecule to trigger action potentials in other taste receptors cells and sensory nerve
        - The ADP converted can mediate autocrine signaling (signal back to cell that secretes the ATP itself)
