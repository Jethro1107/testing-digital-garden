### Pharmacological management of Chronic Hepatitis C

Historically, standard treatment is the use of pegylated [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Interferon\|Interferon]]s and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ribavirin\|Ribavirin]] for 24-48 weeks.

Now, [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Direct-acting antivirals for HCV\|Direct-acting antivirals for HCV]] are available for shortening duration of treatment (around 12 weeks).
