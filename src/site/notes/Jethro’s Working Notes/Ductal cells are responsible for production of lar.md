### Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic HCO3- rich fluids

- **This is achieved via 2 mechanisms:**
    
    Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pumps out 3 Na+ in exchange for 2 K+ at the expense of 1 ATP.
    
    Basolateral Na+/HCO3- cotransporter co-transports Na+ and HCO3- into the pancreatic acinar cell.
    
    This results in an increase in HCO3- levels, such that Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (SLC26A6) pumps out HCO3- in exchange for luminal Cl- ions.
    
    Apical Cl- channels (CFTR) facilitates the action of SLC26A6 by recycling Cl-.

    **Another mechanism creates an acid tide:**
    
    Carbon dioxide combines with water to give H2CO3 via carbonic anhydrase, which dissociates to give H+ and HCO3-.
    
    HCO3- is released into the lumen via apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger.
    
    H+ created from dissociation of H2CO3 is pumped into interstitium via basolateral NHE.

    The HCO3- secreted creates a negative potential and osmotic gradient that drives movement of Na+ and water into the lumen. This results in the formation of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- secretions.
