### Pneumonia

- Bacterial pneumonia
    - **Common bacteria causing pneumonia**
        
        Streptocccus
        
        Staphylococcus
        
        Haemophilus
        
        Pseudomonas
        
        Klebsiella
        
    - **Pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia**
        
        Inhalation of infectious droplets into the lung, resulting in deposition of bacteria in bronchial tree
        
        Bacteria proliferates after deposition to form a colony
        
        Alveolar macrophages detect presence of bacteria, releasing chemotaxic factors for recruitment of neutrophils into alveolar space, triggering tissue inflammation
        
    
    - **Morphological changes/pathology of bacterial pneumonia**
        
        Early stage: Congestion and oedema
        
        Congestion of capillaries and exudate filling up the alveolar space
        
        Intermediate stage: Consolidation
        
        Alveolar space fills up with neutrophils, forming solidification (replacement of air by exudates) of the lungs
        
        Late stage: Resolution or complications
        
        Resolution - infection controlled and inflammation subsides
        
        Complications - destruction of lung parenchyma/spread of infection
        
    - **2 patterns of anatomical distribution of bacterial pneumonia**
        
        Bronchopneumonia - Patchy, bilateral multifocal consolidations centered around the terminal bronchioles (when severe, can be confluent and lobar-like)
        
        Lobar pneumonia - Diffuse consolidations of whole/part of the lobe of the lung, lobe becomes liver like
        
        Ref: [[Robbins  Morphology of bacterial pneumonia\|Robbins  Morphology of bacterial pneumonia]] 
        
    - **Clinical presentation of bacterial pneumonia (signs and symptoms, CXR presentation)**
        
        Systematic signs and symptoms:
        
        Fever, malaise (due to cytokine effect e.g. IL-1, TNF-alpha)
        
        Respiratory symptoms:
        
        Productive cough with yellow-green sputum (purulent exudates)
        
        Shortness of breath in severe cases
        
        Chest pain if pleura is involved (due to presence of nerve fibres)
        
        Bronchial breath sounds (Ref: [[Bronchial and Vesicular Breath Sounds - YouTube - Stanford Medicine 25\|Bronchial and Vesicular Breath Sounds - YouTube - Stanford Medicine 25]])
        
        Crepitations on inspiration (due to air passing through exudate)
        
        CXR presentation:
        
        Patchy or diffuse whitish shadows (consolidations)

    - **Predisposing factors of bacterial pneumonia**
        
        Virulent organism exposure
        
        Immunocomprimised patients - DM patients, cancer, organ transplant patients etc.
        
        Impaired airway clearance - Smoking (immobile cilia), depressed cough reflex, immobile cilia apparatus
        
        Lung congestion and oedema, accumulation of secretions - facilitate bacterial growth
        
        General poor health and malnutrition - alcoholic, old age, malnutrition
        
    - **Outcomes of bacterial pneumonia**
        
        Uncomplicated - total resolution returning to normal lung
        
        Complications:
        
        1. Destruction of lung parenchyma
            
            Organization and fibrosis in airspace - fibroblasts grow into alveolar space, resulting in deposition of collagen

            Lung abcess formation
            
            - **What is a lung abscess?**
                
                Lung abscess refers to a localized area of suppurative necrosis within the pulmonary parenchyma, resulting in the formation of one or more large cavities

        2. Spread of infection
            
            Spread to adjacent organs - pleuritis, pericarditis, empyema thoracis
            
            Distant spread - meningitis, arthritis etc.
            
            - **What is empyema thoracis?**
                
                Empyema thoracis is the collection of pus within the pleural space due to spread of infection from lung
                
                On gross anatomy, yellowish pus covers the lung surface

- Interstitial pneumonitis
    - **Pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonitis**
        
        Virons infect epithelial cells and interstitial cells of the lung interstitium (alveolar wall, peribronchial and peribronchiolar tissue)
        
        This triggers inflammation, resulting in congestion of capillaries and infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells into interstitium(macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells)
        
    - **Morphological changes/pathology of interstitial pneumonitis**
        
        Exudate with mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrate into interstitium

    - **Clinical features of interstitial pneumonitis**
        
        Systemic symptoms:
        
        Fevers, malaise (due to cytokine effect)
        
        Respiratory symptoms:
        
        Non productive cough with minimal sputum (due to minimal exudates into alveolar space)
        
        Alveolocapillary block, causing diffusion impairments, hypoxia and shortness of breath
        
    - **Outcomes of interstitial pneumonitis**
        
        Uncomplicated - Total resolution with normal lung
        
        Complications:
        
        Organization and fibrosis
        
        - Diffuse alveolar damage (death)
            - **Pathogenesis of diffuse alveolar damage**
                
                Epithelial cell injury is detected by alveolar macrophages, which release inflammatory factors (IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-8) for endothelial activation and recruitment of neutrophils
                
                Activated neutrophils enter interstitium and alveoli, releasing destructive products (ROS, protease) that damage the epithelium and endothelium
                
                Fibrin rich exudates entering alveoli and necrotic epithelial cells reorganize into hyaline membrane
                
                Type II pneumocytes proliferate to line the alveolar wall
                
            - **Histological features of diffuse alveolar damage**
                
                Hyaline membrane consisting of fibrin-rich exudates and necrotic debris
                
                Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia lining alveolar wall
                
                Interstitial oedema with predominant mononuclear infiltrates

- Tuberculosis
    - **What is tuberculosis?**
        
        Tuberculosis is the chronic inflammation caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
        
    - **Microorganism causing tuberculosis and staining properties**
        
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis
        
        It is an acid-fast bacilli, which enables it to resist acid decolorization during Ziehl-Neelsen stain
        
    - Pathogenesis of tuberculosis
        
        Ref: [[Robbins  Pathogenesis of tuberculosis\|Robbins  Pathogenesis of tuberculosis]] 
        
    - **Histopathological hallmarks of tuberculosis**
        
        Granulomatous inflammation:
        
        A focus of chronic inflammation consisting of microscopic aggregation of activated macrophages that are transformed into epitheloid cells, and langhanâ€™s giant cell surrounded by a collar of mononucleated leukocytes, principally lymphocytes and occasionally mast cells

    - **Gross pathology of tuberculosis**
        
        Caseous necrosis - creamy white morphology, soft
        
        Cavitations
        
        Scarring and fibrosis
        
        Calcification - chalky white morphology, hard
        
    - **Types of mycobacterial infection**
        
        Primary tuberculosis:
        
        Infection of individual with no previous ontact with M. tuberculosis
        
        Results in small scar and minimal granuoma
        
        Secondary tuberculosis:
        
        Re-infection or re-activation of latent MTB in previously sensitized individual
        
        Results in type IV hypersensitivity reaction with granuloma formation
        
        Milliary tuberculosis:
        
        Systemic spread, resulting in many granuloma formation
        
- Opportunistic infections
    - **What is opportunistic infection?**
        
        Infections caused by microorganisms that are not pathogenic in healthy immunocompetent patients, but are severe and life-threatening to immunocomprimised patients
        
    - Pneumocystis jirovecii
        - **What is pneumocystis jirovecii?**
            
            A common fatal fungal infection in HIV patients
            
        - **Clinical feature of pneumocystic jirovecii**
            
            Alveolar cast - frosty sputum, with ball like exudates detected by broncho-alveolar lavage
            

### Bronchiectasis

- **What is bronchiectasis?**
    
    Bronchietasis - the permanent dilation of bronchi and bronchiioles caused by destruction of smooth muscles and supporting elastic tissue
    
- **Pathogenesis of bronchiectasis**
    
    Bronchiectasis is caused by two processes: obstruction and infection
    
    Bronchial obstruction impairs airway clearance, which predisposes to infection
    
    Infection results in weakening and scarring in bronchial wall
    
    Infection may also impair airway clearance, resulting in a obstruction
    
    During inhalation, the negative intrapulmonary pressure pulls on the weakened bronchial wall, causing segmental dilatation
    
    Ref: [[Robbins  Pathogenesis of bronchiectasis\|Robbins  Pathogenesis of bronchiectasis]] 
    
- **Morphological changes/pathology of bronchiectasis**
    
    Dilatation of airways
    
    Can be diffuse or local, depending on obstruction
    
    Local - tumor, aspirates, foreign bodies etc.
    
    Diffuse - Cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia
