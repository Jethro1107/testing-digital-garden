### Absorption of luminal oligopeptides and amino acids into enterocytes occur via different mechanisms

Absorption of luminal dipeptides and tripeptides occur via Apical Peptide transporter 1 (PepT1;SLC15A1), which co-transports peptides with H+ ions down a proton gradient generated by apical NHE.

- Basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase pumps out 3 Na+ and pumps in 2 K+ at the expense of 1 ATP.
- This creates a Na+ gradient, which drives NHE to pump in Na+ and pump out H+.
- The creation of H+ gradient drives the action of PepT1.

Absorption of amino acid occurs via a variety of Na+-dependent amino acid transport systems on the apical membrane.

They key difference between absorption of luminal oligopeptides and amino acids into enterocytes is that **oligopeptide absorption is H+ dependent, while amino acid absorption is Na+ dependent**.

- **Processing of intracellular oligopeptides and the absorption of amino acids into circulation**
    
    Oligopeptides cannot move across the basolateral membrane into circulation. Hence, oligopeptides must be broken down into dipeptidase and tripeptidase into amino acid.
    
    Amino acids (from the breakdown of intracellular oligopeptides or from absorption of luminal amino acids) move across the basolateral membrane into circulation via basolateral facilitated diffusion transporters.
