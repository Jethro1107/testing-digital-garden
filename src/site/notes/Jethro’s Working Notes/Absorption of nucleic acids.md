### Absorption of nucleic acids

Dietary nucleic acids are mainly absorbed as nucleosides via apical concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNT1-3), a Na+ dependent transpoorter, and equilabrative nucleoside transporters on the basolateral membrane.

Pentose is absorbed via the paracellular route (through the leaky tight junctions) by passive diffusion.

Phosphate is absorbed via the paracellular route (via tight junctions) and via the transcellular route, mediated by type II Na+ dependent phosphate transporters (Npt2b).
