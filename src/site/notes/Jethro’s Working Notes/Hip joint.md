### Hip joint

The hip joint is the articulation between the lunate (articular) surface of the acetabulum of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pelvic girdle\|Pelvic girdle]], and the head of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femur\|Femur]].

- **Classification of the hip joint**
    
    The hip joint is classified as a ball and socket joint.
    

When comparing to its upper limb couterpart, the [[Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)\|Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)]]]], it is designed for *stability and weight bearing* at the expense of mobility.

The lunate surface of the acetabulum and the head of the femur is lined with hyaline cartilage.

The margins of the lunate surface of the acetabulum is lined with a fibrocartilage, the acetabular labrum, where it bridges inferiorly across the acetabular notch as the transverse acetabular ligament, which deepens the socket.

The ligamentum teres connects the fosea capitis to the transverse acetabulum ligament, which conveys the artery of ligamentum teres.

- **Joint capsule of the hip joint**
    
    Compared with the [[loose fitting joint capsule of the shoulder [[joint\|loose fitting joint capsule of the shoulder [[joint]]]], the joint capsule of the hip joint is much stronger.
    
    Its proximal attachment is around the acetabular labrum and the transverse acetabular ligament, whereas its distal attachment is at the intertrochanteric line anteriorly, and the neck of the femur posteriorly, covering 2/3 of the posterior surface of the femoral neck (i.e. the intertrochanteric crest and quadrate tubercle is spared and lies outside the joint capsule).
    
    The spirally aranged fibrous membrane of the joint capsule of the hip joint is thickened to give 3 intrinsic ligaments:
    
    - Iliofemoral ligament - Located anteriorly
    - Pubofemoral ligament - located anteroinferiorly
    - Ischiofemoral ligament - located posteriorly

- **Bursa of the hip joint**
    
    Anteriorly, the synovial membrane herniates through the joint capsule to give the iliopectineal bursa.
    
    Posteriorly, the synovial membrane herniates through the joint capsule to give the bursa of the obturator externus.

- **Stabilization of the hip joint**
    
    The hip joint is a very stable joint, due to the congruency of the articular surfaces and 3 ligaments:
    
    - Iliofemoral ligament
    - Pubofemoral ligament
    - Ischiofemoral ligament
    
    The hip joint is the most stable when it is hyperextended, as it causes the ligaments to be taunt, pulling the articular surfaces together.
    
    The hip joint is most unstable when it is flexed and adducted, as ligaments are laxed.
    
- **Movement of the hip joint**
    
    The hip joint enables:
    
    - Flexion and extension
    - Abduction and adduction
    - Medial rotation and lateral rotation
    - Circumduction
- **Blood supply to the femoral head**
    
    Retinacular arteries (branches of medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries) - They pierce through the joint capsule and are held in place by retinecula (reflections of synovial membrane. They eventually enter and supply the femoral head.
    
    Artery of ligamentum teres (branch of obturator artery) - It is conveyed by the ligamentum teres to the femoral head. It is more important in children, but is obliterated in adults.
    
    Nutrient artery of the femur (within the shaft) - It contributes little blood supply to the femur head.

Associated pathologies:

- Hip fractures (common in menopausal women due to osteoporosis) - Can be classifed as intracapsular, intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric. Fractures in the neck may tear retinacular arteries, resulting in *avascular necrosis of the femoral head.*
- Dislocation of the hip joint - It usually dislocates posteriorly, which may tear the ligamentum teres and its artery, resulting in *avascular necrosis of the femoral head in children.*
