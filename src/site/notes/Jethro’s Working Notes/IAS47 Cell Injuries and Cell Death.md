### Cause of cell injury

- How are causes of cell injury roughly classified?
    
    Hypoxia
    
    Physical agents
    
    Chemical agents
    
    Biological agents
    
    Immunological reactions
    
    Others
    
- What are the different causes of hypoxia?
    
    Ischaemia (most common) - lack of blood supply due to thrombosis or embolism formation in blood vessel
    
    Anemic hypoxia - Reduced O2 carrying capacity of the blood
    
    Histotoxic hypoxia - Reduced intracellular oxidative enzymes
    
    Cf: [[Types of hypoxia\|Types of hypoxia]]
    
- What are the physical agents causing cell injury?
    
    Trauma
    
    Pressure and temperature
    
    Exposure to radiation and electricity
    
- What are the chemical agents causing cell injury?
    
    Poisons, drugs, alcohol
    
- What are the biological agents causing cell injury?
    
    Bacteria, virus, fungus, parasite
    
- What are the immunological reactions causing cell injury?
    
    Hypersensitive reactions (allergy)
    
    Autoimmunity
    
- What are the other causes of cell injury?
    
    Genetic defects
    
    Nutritional imbalance
    

### Possible responses of cell to injury

- What are the possible cellular responses to stress and noxious influences/injurious stimuli?
    
    Stress triggers cellular adaptation such as hyperplasia, metaplasia, hypertrophy and atrophy to maintain homeostasis
    
    If there are injurious stimulus, or if the cell fails to adapts, it may result in reversible cell injury
    
    If the intensity of stimulus is very strong, or if the reversible cell injury persists, it may result in irreversible cell injury and cell death

- Describe the process of pathogenesis of cell injury.
    
    All stress and noxious influence exert their effect at a biochemical level
    
    Structural changes result from biochemical changes and occur after the biochemical changes
    
    Histochemical/Ultrastructural changes are observed first, then light microscopic changes are observed, and eventually gross examination changes are observed

- What are the principal biochemical mechanisms and hence site of damage in cell injury?
    
    Mitochondria - affecting intracellular aerobic respiration
    
    Membrane damage - leakage of cellular components or release of lysosomal content
    
    Enzymatic and structural protein
    
    Genetic apparatus damage
    
- What are the factors affecting the results of cell injury?
    
    Injury - type, duration and severity
    
    Cell - type, state, adaptability
    
    - Give an example in which cell type affects result to cell injury.
        
        Different cell types have different susceptibility to ischemic injury

### Reversible Injury

- What is reversible injury and degeneration?
    
    Reversible injury is the stage of cell injury in which derranged function and morphology of the injured cell can return normal if the damaging stimulus is removed
    
    Degeneration refers to the observable morphological changes in cells caused by reversible injury

    Caused by derrangement in cell membrane, resulting in influx of isotonic fluid and accumulation and Na+ and water

### Irreversible Injury

- Apoptosis
    - **What is apoptosis?**
        
        Apoptosis is a pathway of cell death in which a cell activates enzymes to degrade its own DNA and proteins
        
        It involves death of individual cells, maintaining tissue architecture
        
        Cf: [[Robbins  What is apoptosis \|Robbins  What is apoptosis ]] 
        
    - **Causes of apoptosis**
        
        Physiological apoptosis - embryological development, normal turnover of cells
        
        Pathological apoptosis  - Cell-mediated cytotoxicity, radiation, drugs, accumulation of misfolded proteins
        
        ![[/Screenshot 2022-04-08 at 8.57.16 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2022-04-08 at 8.57.16 PM.png]]
        
    - **Mechanisms of apoptosis**
        
        Apoptosis can be mediated by the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway
        
        Intrinsic factor is regulated by a family of proteins:
        
        Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are antiapoptotic, reducing permeability of mitochondria
        
        Bak and Bax are propapoptotic, which dimerize and form channels through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial protein escape into the cytosol
        
        The expression of Bak and Bax is regulated by Bh3 sensors, which can detect cell injury
        
        Cytochrome c activates caspase
        
        Extrinsic pathway is regulated by:
        
        Receptor-ligand interaction - Fas, TNF receptor
        
        Activation of ‘death’ receptor triggers a signalling cascade that activates caspase
        
        T cell cytotoxicity mediated by perforin and granzyme
        
        Caspase activates endonuclease and protease, resulting in apoptosis
        
        Endonuclease - causes DNA fragmentation to around 200bp fragments
        
        Chromatin and cytoplasm condensation occurs
        
        Membrane blebs, resulting in formation of apoptotic bodies
        
        Apoptotic bodies are phagocytosed by phagocytes

        Cf: [[Robbins  Mechanism of apoptosis\|Robbins  Mechanism of apoptosis]] 
        
    - **Morphology of apoptosis**
        
        Apoptosis is characterised morphologically by cell shrinkage, eosinophilia, chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing
        
    - **Morphology of apoptotic bodies**
        
        Dark and shrunken
        
- Necrosis
    - **What is necrosis?**
        
        Necrosis is a form of cell death in which cellular membrane fall apart and cellular enzymes leak out and ultimately digest the cell
        
        It involves death of an entire sheet of cells, causing lost of tissue architecture
        
    - **Classification of necrosis by way of digestion of cells**
        
        Autolysis - Structural disintegration due to digestion by lysosomal hydrolase released by necrotic cells
        
        Heterolysis - Structural disintegration due to digestion by immigrate leucocytes
        
    - **Cytoplasmic and nuclear change in necrosis**
        
        Cytoplasmic change:
        
        Cells enlargement and eosinophilia (due to loss of light staining glycogen)
        
        Nuclear change:
        
        Pyknosis - nucleus shrink
        
        Karyorrhexis - Nuclear fragmentation
        
        Karyolysis - Nucleus dissapears
        
    - **5 Morphology of necrosis**
        - Coagulative necrosis
            - **Gross pathology of coagulative necrosis**
                
                Most common form of necrosis
                
                Yellowish, dull, firm, lusterless
                
            - **Histopathology of coagulative necrosis**
                
                Tissue architecture and cell outline intact, loss of nucleus
                
                Cell appears to be eosinophilic, opaque tombstone

### Autophagy

- What is autophagy?
    
    Autophagy refers to the coordinated lysosomal digestion of the cell's own components
    
- What is the mechanism of autophagy?
    
    Cellular organelles are enclosed into cytoplasmic autophagosome that fuse with lysosome to digest the enclosed material
    
    It involves digesting its own cellular components and recycling its components for nutrients and energy
    
- What is the function of autophagy?
    
    Adaptive response enhanced during nutritient deprivation
    
    Plays a role in host defense against certain microbes
    
- In what disease does dysregulation of autophagy occur?
