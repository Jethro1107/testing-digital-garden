### Full abduction of the arm requires the action of 4 muscles

Full abduction of the arm occurs from 0 to 180 degrees, and requires 4 muscles to make it happen.

From 0-45 degrees, initiation of abduction of the humerus at the glenohumeral joint is mediated by the supraspinatus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rotary cuff muscles\|Rotary cuff muscles]]). Beyond 45 degrees, and up to 150 degrees, the Middle part of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Deltoid\|Deltoid]] takes over.

Beyond 150 degrees, abduction can no longer occur at the glenohumeral joint, but rather, involves the upward rotation of the scapulae ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Full abduction involves upward rotation of the scapulae\|Full abduction involves upward rotation of the scapulae]]), which is mediated by 2 muscles. The upper fibres of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Trapezius\|Trapezius]] elevates the acromion and the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Serratus anterior\|Serratus anterior]] pulls the inferior angle laterally, which results in the upward rotation of the scapulae.
