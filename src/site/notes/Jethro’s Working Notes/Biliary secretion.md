### Biliary secretion

- **Composition of bile**
    
    Biliary secretion consist of mostly water (97-98%), electrolytes, and organic components (bile salt, cholesterol, and bilirubin).

### Regulation of biliary secretion

Similar to pancreatic secretions, bicarbonate secretion by cholangiocytes is stimulated by secretin ([[Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase\|Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase]]).

While bile is continuously secreted by hepatocytes and modified by cholangiocytes, most of it is stored within the gallbladder. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cholecystokinin controls gallbladder emptying\|Cholecystokinin controls gallbladder emptying]].
