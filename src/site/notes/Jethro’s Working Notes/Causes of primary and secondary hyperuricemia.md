### Causes of primary and secondary hyperuricemia

Hyperuricemia (clinically defined as serum uric acid levels > 6.8mg/dL) is often caused by abnormal [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Uric acid metabolism\|Uric acid metabolism]]. It can be due to excess uric acid synthesis, reduced uric acid excretion or both.

- ********************************Excess uric acid synthesis********************************
    
    There are different causes of excess uric acid synthesis that results in primary and secondary hyperuricemia:
    
    **Primary hyperuricemia:**
    
    - Idiopathic
    - Complete (Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome) or partial deficiency of Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyl Transferase (HGPRT)
    
    **Secondary hyperuricemia:**
    
    - Excess purine consumption
    - Myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders
    - Haemolytic disease
    - Tumour lysis syndrome
    - Psoriasis
    - Glycogen storage disease
- ******************************************************Reduced uric acid excretion******************************************************
    
    There are different causes of reduced uric acid excretion that results in primary and secondary hyperuricemia.
    
    **Primary hyperuricemia - Idiopathic**
    
    **Secondary hyperuricemia:**
    
    - Chronic kidney disease
    - Dehydration
    - Diuretics (particularly Loop diuretics and thiazide diuretics, see [[CPR45  Diuretics; Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors\|CPR45  Diuretics; Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors]])
- ******************************************************************************************************************************Both excess uric acid synthesis and reduced uric acid excretion******************************************************************************************************************************
    - *Alcohol use*
    - Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency
    - Fructose-1-phosphate-aldolase deficiency
