### Anatomy of the small intestine

The small intestine is the segment of the bowel that extends from the pyloric opening to the ileocecal junction.

Structural properties of the small intestines include the circular folds of the small intestine, which increase the surface area for the absorption ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Digestive and absorption\|Digestive and absorption]]). Histologically, these circular folds are the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pilcae circulares\|Pilcae circulares]] of the small intestine ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Histology of the small intestine\|Histology of the small intestine]]).

There are 3 parts of the small intestine, the duodenum, the jejunum and ileum.

- ****************Duodenum****************
    
    The duodenum is the shortest, but widest C-shaped segment of the small intestine (25cm). It is the main site of chemical digestion.
    
    The duodenum is separated into 4 parts:
    
    - 1st part (superior part) - The first part of the duodenum is also called the duodenal cap.
    - 2nd part (descending part)
    - 3rd part (inferior part)
    - 4th part (ascending part)
    
    The initial segment of the 1st part of the duodenum is intraperitoneal (and hence suspended by a mesentery), while the remaining parts are retroperitoneal.
    
    In the postero-medial wall of the 2nd part of the duodenum, the minor and major duodenal papilla are present for the passage of secretions in the accessory pancreatic duct and the **Ampulla of Vater** (the short duct formed by the union of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct).
    
- **********************************Jejunum and Ileum**********************************
    
    The jejunum and ileum together is much longer than the duodenum (6-7m in adults), and are loops of bowel that are suspended from the mesentery of the small intestine ([[Mesenteries (Peritoneal [[folds)\|Mesenteries (Peritoneal [[folds)]]]]. They run obliquely from the left upper quadrant to the right lower quadrant.
    
    They are supplied by the intestinal (jejunal and ileal) arteries, which are branches of the superior mesenteric artery ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera\|Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera]]), which develop collateral supply as a result of arterial arcade. Vasa recta enters enters the gut wall and pierces through the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/The common histological layers of the GI tract\|The common histological layers of the GI tract]].
    
    The jejunum and ileum do not have a clear demarcation, but can be differentiated by the organization of their arterial supply:
    
    - The jejunum consist of 1 layer of arcades and long vasa recta
    - The ileum consist of multiple layers of arcades and short vasa recta
