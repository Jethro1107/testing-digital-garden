### Reflux esophagitis

- **What is reflux esophagitis?**
    
    Reflux esophagitis is [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Esophagitis\|Esophagitis]]  that is caused by frequent and protracted reflux of gastric contents into the lower oesophagus. It is highly associated with the clinical condition Gastroeosophageal reflux disease (GERD). 
    
- **Pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis**
    
    Reflux of gastric juices is central to development of mucosa injury in GERD.
    
    Conditions that decrease lower esophageal sphincter tone or increase intra-abdominal pressure contributes to GERD: These include alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, CNS depressants, pregnancy, hiatal hernia, delayed gastric emptying, and increased gastric volume.
    
- **Gross pathology of reflux esophagitis**
    
    Reflux eesophagitis is characterised by mucosal injury in distal esophagus. It can be observed on endoscopy:
    
    - A loss of the whitish, shiny esophageal surface, which is replaced by eosinophilia of the oesophageal mucosa (reddish mucosa).
    - A loss of the gastroesophageal junction (OGJ) due to inflammation.

- **Histopathology of reflux esophagitis**
    
    Histological hallmarks of reflux esophagitis includes:
    
    - Hyperplasia of the stratified squamous epithelium, and
    - Neutrophils/ Polymorphs present in the esophageal mucosa.

- **Clinical features of reflux esophagitis**
    
    Reflux esophagitis commonly presents with *heartburn* and *dysphagia*. 
    
    Less commonly, regurgitation of sour-tasting gastric contents may be noticible.
    
- **Complications of reflux esophagitis**
    
    Complications of reflux esophagitis include:
    
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peptic ulcer\|Peptic ulcer]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Barrett Esophagus\|Barrett Esophagus]] and subsequent development of esophageal adenocarcinoma ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Neoplasia of the esophagus\|Neoplasia of the esophagus]] )
