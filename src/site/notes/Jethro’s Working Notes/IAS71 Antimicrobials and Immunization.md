### Classification of Antibiotics

- What are antimicrobials?
    
    Antimicrobials are substances that kills or inhibits growth of an infectious microorganism
    
- How are antibacterial agents classified?
    
    By chemical structure
    
    By target site
    
    By activity
    
- How are antibiotics classified by chemical structure? How are they further classified?
    
    Beta lactams (consist of beta lactam ring) - Penicillins, cephamyin, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactems
    
    Glycopeptide - Vancomycin, teicoplanin
    
    Fluroquinolone - Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (note: Nalidixic acid is the only quinolone in clinical use)
    
    Tetracycline (4 glycoside structures) - Doxycycline, Minocycline
    
    Aminoglycosides (3 glycoside structures) - Gentamicin, Tobramycin
    
    Macrolides (Macrocyclic ring with one or more deoxy sugar attached)
    

- How are antibiotics classified by site of action?
    
    Cell Wall synthesis - beta lactams, Glycopeptides, Bacitracin
    
    Plasma membrane - Polymyxin, Lipopeptide
    
    DNA synthesis - Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin)
    
    RNA synthesis - rifampicin
    
    30S subunit - Aminoglycosides, tetracycline
    
    50S subunit - macrolides, lincosamides, chloramphenicol, oxazolidinones
    
    Folic acid synthesis - Sulphonamides, sulphones, trimethoprim
    
    Mycolic acid synthesis - Isoniazid

- Describe the action of beta lactam.
    
    The peptidoglycan layer is synthesized by 2 reactions: 
    
    Transglycoslation and Transpeptidation
    
    The two reactions are mediated by the same protein (penicillin binding protein), which has TPase and TGase activity
    
    Beta lactam act by opening up the beta-lactam ring and bind to the catalytic site of TPase and TGase, the serine residue, thus interfering its activity and inhibiting cell wall synthesis
    
- Describe the action of vancomycin.
    
    Vancomycin works by occupying D-alanine-D-alanine portion of the tetrapeptide sequence of NAM, thus preventing formation of amino acid cross link to hold glycan layers together

### Assessment of Antibacterial Activity

- What is bactericidal? What is bacteriostatic?
    
    Bactericidal - Action of agent will kill the target microbe, >99.9% decrease in the initial inoculum
    
    Bacteriostatic - Action of agent will inhibit growth of the target microbe but will not kill it, no visible growth
    
- How is MIC and MBC assessed?
    
    First, perform a serial dilution of the antibiotic
    
    Then inoculate standardized test bacteria to the different test tubes
    
    Incubate overnight
    
    Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) is the concentration with no visible growth
    
    Then, subculture to a drug-free agar plate and incubate overnight
    
    MBC is the lowest concentration with no bacterial growth on agar
    
    Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the lowest concentration that kills the initial inoculum by >99.9% (no bacterial growth in agar after overnight inoculation
    
- What are examples of bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents?
    
    Bactericidal:
    
    - Cell wall synthesis:
        - beta lactams
        - Vancomycin
    - 30S subunit:
        - Aminoglycosides
    - DNA synthesis:
        - Fluoroquinolones
    
    Bacteriostatic:
    
    - Ribosome:
        - Macrolides
        - Tetracyclin
        - Clindamycin
        - Chloramphenicol
    - Metabolic pathways:
        - Sulphonamides
        - Trimethoprim

- Is designation of bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties absolute?
    
    No, it is arbitary
    
    May be bactericidal for one bacterium and bacteriostatic for another
    
    May be bacteriostatic at low concentration and bactericidal at high concentration
    
    May be bactericidal at low inoculum and bacteriostatic at high inoculum
    

### Vaccination and Immunization

- What is immunization?
    
    The process of artificially inducing immunity or providing protection from disease, often by vaccines
    
    Vaccines are antigenic preparation used to induce immunity
    
- What are the different types of vaccines?
    
    Live, attenuated pathogens (virus, bacteria)
    
    Inactivated pathogen - Whole, subunit, toxoids
    
- What is active immunization?
    
    Active immunization is the induction of adaptive immunity, by priming the immune system with antigen to trigger preexisting immunity to prevent infection
    
    Upon exposure, infection will be mild and subclinical
    
- What are the advantages of live, attenuated vaccines?
    
    Mimic natural infection, stimulate T-lymphocytes naturally, and induces mucosal immunity
    
    Protects the unvaccinated as vaccine strains are still infectious, resulting in herd immunity
    
- What are the potential problems of live, attenuated vaccines?
    
    Vaccines strains can cause disease:
    
    In immunocompetent recipients: revert to virulence (rare)
    
    In immunocomprimised recipients: can be from immunization before diagnosis of condition, or from person to person transmission of vaccine strain
    
- When is inactivated vaccines used?
    
    Impossible to attenuate
    
    Too risky to use attenuated vaccine due to unknown stability, as there is a risk of reversion
    
- How is inactivation of pathogen carried out?
    
    Heat
    
    Chemicals: Form aldehyde, beta-propiolactone
    
- What are the limitations of inactivated vaccines?
    
    Less imunogenic
    
    Poorer stimulation of memory cells, thus shorter duration of protection
    
- What are the ways to improve immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines?
    1. Adjuvent - Substances to boost non-specific immune response
        
        Good for inducing antibody responses but less active in inducing cell-mediated immunity
        
        e.g. Aluminium salts
        
    2. Protein conjugation
        
        Capsulated bacteria consist of capsular polysaccharides as antigens, which cannot stimulate T cells
        
        Polysaccharides may stimulate B cells to differentiate into only plasma cells, with no new memory cells production, and a depletion of the memory B cell pool. such that the subsequent response is decreased
        
        Conjugate polysaccharides to protein carriers to stimulate T cells
        
        Stimulated T cells can activate B cells by CD40L-CD40 interaction, to produce plasma cells and memory cells
        
- What constitutes the differences in vaccination programmes?
    
    Disease Burden
    
    Vaccine availability, efficacy and safety
    
    Availability of treatment
    
    Affordability 
    
- What is passive immunization?
    
    Providing temporary protection through administration of exogenously produced antibody or memory T cells
    
- What are the different types of immunoglobin products?
    
    Pooled human Immunoglobulin - Contains antibodies from unselected pools of donor blood, involving more than 1000 donor
    
    Each donor has different antibodies from different exposure, hence Pooled human immunoglobulin can cover the entire range of pathogens circulating in the community
    
    Specific Immunoglobulin - Contains antibodies against a specific disease from pre-selected pools of donor blood, which consist of high antibody content against the disease
    
- When is passive immunization used?
    
    Immediate protection required
    
    Useful for those unable to respond respond immunologically
    
    As prophylaxis or replacement therapy
    
- What are the problems of passive immunization?
    
    Short-lived effect
    
    Use of antiserum raised in animals can cause serum sickness
    
    Residual risk of blood-born infection
