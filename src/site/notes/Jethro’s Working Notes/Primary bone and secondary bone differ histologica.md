### Primary bone and secondary bone differ histologically

On histological examination, there are two different bone types: Immature primary bone and mature secondary bone.

### Primary bone

Primary bone is found during embryological development and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bone repair\|Bone repair]].

It is characterised by random deposition of collagen (hence named woven bone).

Primary bone occurs transiently, eventually, all primary bone will be remodelled into secondary bone.

### Secondary bone

Most bones are secondary bones.

It is characterised by the organised lamellae of bone tissue, either forming concentric lamellae around a harvesian canal, in an osteon, or parallel to each other (interstitial lamellae).
