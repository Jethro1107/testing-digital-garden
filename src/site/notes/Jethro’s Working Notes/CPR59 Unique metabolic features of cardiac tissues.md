### Metabolic profile of the heart

- Energy requirements of the heart
    - **Mitochondria, and fuel storage in cardiomyocytes**
        
        High mitochondrial density (occupies 1/3 volume of the cadiomyocyte)
        
        Some storage of TAG, but very little storage of Glycogen
        
    - **Source of ATP in cardiomyocytes**
        
        95% of ATP is produced from oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria
        
        5% of ATP is produced from substrate level phosphorylation via oxygen-independent reactions
        
    - **Utilization of ATP in cardiomyocytes**
        
        ATP is required for:
        
        Binding to myosin head to facilitate contractile cycle
        
        Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)
        
        Other basal metabolic activity e.g. maintaining exchange pumps on plasma membrane
        
        ![[9D0CE27A-656C-45A9-9487-2260F1AF4721.jpeg\|9D0CE27A-656C-45A9-9487-2260F1AF4721.jpeg]]
        
    - **Two important source of energy in cardiomyocytes**
        
        ATP
        
        Creatinine phosphate/phosphocreatinine (PCr)
        
        ![[8769F5E3-DAAE-4461-994A-A758182DE6D7.jpeg\|8769F5E3-DAAE-4461-994A-A758182DE6D7.jpeg]]
        
- Fuel utilization of the heart
    - **Fuel preference in a developing heart**
        
        Glucose and lactate preferred due to high oxygen efficiency
        
        Fatty acid, lactate and ketone bodies serve as fuel molecules to a lesser extent
        
        ![[21A63EFC-1623-4035-94AF-74D1527AD9D1.jpeg\|21A63EFC-1623-4035-94AF-74D1527AD9D1.jpeg]]
        
    - **Fuel preference in an adult heart**
        
        Fatty acid is the prefered fuel molecule is it yields the most ATP per fuel molecule, which is necessary for maintaining cardiac output (60-70%)
        
        Glucose is also used as a fuel molecule
        
        Amino acids and ketone bodies account for a very small proportion in normal physiological conditions
        
        ![[80290F0D-F9F6-424B-A61D-DFE4F21F1492.jpeg\|80290F0D-F9F6-424B-A61D-DFE4F21F1492.jpeg]]
        
- Metabolism of the heart
    - Fatty acid metabolism in the heart
        - **Source of fatty acid for cardiomyocytes**
            
            FA from blood supply:
            
            Released by lipoproteins
            
            FA complexed with albumin
            
            FA derived from lipolysis of TAG within cardiomyocytes
            
            Note: FA is not derived from de nevo fatty acid synthesis in cardiomyocytes
            
        - **Metabolic fates of fatty acid in cardiomyocytes**
            1. FA may undergo lipogenesis to give TAG
            2. FA enters mitochondria and undergoes beta-oxidation
            
            ![[86128E56-C3B8-4065-93E9-41E84D42D788.jpeg\|86128E56-C3B8-4065-93E9-41E84D42D788.jpeg]]
            
    - Glucose metabolism in the heart
        - **Source of glucose for cardiomyocytes**
            
            Glucose from blood supply:
            
            Insulin-dependent uptake by GLUT-1 and GLUT-4
            
            Glucose release from glycogenolysis is limited as there is an insignificant glycogen in cardiomyocytes (20% of skeletal muscle glycogen storage)
            
        - **Metabolic fates of glucose in cardiomyocyte**
            
            Glucose undergoes glycolysis to give pyruvate
            
            2 fates of pyruvate:
            
            1. Converted to lactate (anaerobic glycolysis)
            2. Enters TCA cycle and ETC in mitochondria for complete utilization (glucose oxidation)
            
            ![[1B882FBC-7F9E-4CAE-9D35-F1BD2C088818.jpeg\|1B882FBC-7F9E-4CAE-9D35-F1BD2C088818.jpeg]]
            
        - **Reciprocal suppression of glucose and fatty acid**
            
            Pyruvate and fatty acid is not simutaneously shuttled into mitochondria for oxidation
            
            This enables coordinated utilization of fuel
            
            Ref: [[Glucose fatty acid cycle\|Glucose fatty acid cycle]]
            
    - Metabolic flexibility of the heart
        - **Fuel molecules used by the heart**
            
            Fatty acid, glucose, amino acids, ketone bodies, lactate
            
            Where fatty acids and glucose are the main fuel source
            
        - **Why is the heart said to be metabolically flexible?**
            
            It is able to make fuel switches in response to signaling pathways and substrate availability
            
        - **Factors affecting fuel utilization of the heart**
            1. Substrate availability
                
                e.g. After meal → utilize glucose, prolonged fasting → utilize ketone bodies, after exercise → utilize lactate
                
            2. Signaling pathways and enzyme activation/deactivation

### Metabolic shifts of the heart

- Metabolic shift in physiological hypertrophy
    - **Occurence of physiological hypertrophy**
        
        Trained through regular physical training
        
    - **Metabolic shift in physiological hypertrophy**
        
        There is increased mitotic density:
        
        This results in increased dependence on oxidative phosphorylation
        
        This also results in dependence on fatty acid as the preferred fuel
        
    - **Function of metabolic shift in physiological hypertrophy**
        
        This serves as a protective mechanism in ischaemia reperfusion injury
        
- Metabolic shift in pathological hypertrophy
    - **Occurence of pathological hypertrophy**
        
        Occurs in in response to decreased oxygen in haemodynamic burden, e.g. hypertension, aortic stenosis
        
    - **Metabolic shift in pathological hypertrophy**
        
        Due to decreased oxygen supply, there is metabolic shift to fuels with higher oxygen efficiency
        
        Thus there is increased glucose oxidation and decreased fatty acid oxidation (assuming fetal-like fuel utilization)
        
    - **Effects of metabolic shift in pathological hypertrophy**
        
        The metabolic shift to glucose (high oxygen efficiency fuel), results in decreased ATP production, causing a decrease in energy reserve
        
        Decreased ATP production, resulting in increase in PCr:ATP ratio, indicates good prognosis for heart failure
        
- Metabolic shift in diabetic heart disease
    - **Metabolic shift in diabetic heart disease**
        
        Low insulin or insulin resistance reduces GLUT4 expression and insertion, thus reducing glucose uptake and decreasing glucose oxidation
        
        Hyperlipidemia in diabetic patients results in increased fatty acid uptake by cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased triglyceride storage and increased dependence on FA oxidation
        
        The heart becomes less flexible in metabolic shifting
        
    - **Effects of metabolic shift in diabetic heart disease**
        
        Increased fatty acid uptake results in increased triglyceride storage in cardiomyocytes, potentiating lipotoxicity
        
        Hyperglycemia in diabetics results in increased glucose uptake via GLUT1, potentiating glucotoxicity
        

### Metabolic derrangements in heart failure

- Metabolic features leading to heart failure
    - Energy deprivation
        - **Mechanisms of energy deprivation in leading to heart failure**
            
            Carbon fuels may be shuttled to other metabolic pathways such as pentose phosphate pathway, hexoamine biosynthesis pathway, autophagy and production of ROS, resulting in decreased ATP production
            
            This also results in decreased shuttling of phosphate to creatinine, resulting in a decrease in PCr:ATP ratio, which is an indicator for poor prognosis in heart failure
            
    - Deranged substrate utilization and intermediate metabolism
        - **Mechanisms of reduced fatty acid utilization in leading to heart failure**
            
            Reduced fatty acid utilization results in reduced fatty acid oxidation
            
            Thus, this results in a mismatch between fatty acid uptake and fatty acid oxidation
            
            The surplus fatty acid uptake results in:
            
            Increased TAG storage, resulting in lipotoxicity
            
            Increased formation of toxic lipid species such as ceramides and diacylglycerol
            
            This also triggers signaling cascade that results in insulin resistance, causing decreased fatty acid and glucose uptake, worsening energy deprivation
            
        - **Mechanisms of increased glucose utilization in leading to heart failure**
            
            Increased glucose uptake results in increased in rate of glycolysis
            
            This results in a mismatch between pyruvate oxidation and rate of glycolysis, resulting in:
            
            High level of toxic intermediates (glucotoxicity)
            
            FA overload may further result in insulin resistance, which results in insulin resistance, and thus decreased glucose uptake
            
    - Increased oxidative stress
        - **Cause of increased oxidative stress leading to heart failure**
            
            Derranged production of intermediates
            
            Mitochondrial damage resulting in faulting electron transport chain
