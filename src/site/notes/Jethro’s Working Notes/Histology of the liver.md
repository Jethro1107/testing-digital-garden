### Histology of the liver

The liver is the largest gland in the body.

- **The liver consist of an overarching histological architecture, that is:**
    
    The Glisson’s capsule surrounds the entire liver. The capsule forms connective tissue stroma that extends into the liver to separate the parenchyma into lobules.
    
    The connective tissue stroma consists of blood vessels, bile ducts, lymphatics and nerves.
    

Organization of the hepatic parenchyma is understood in 3 ways ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Classical hepatic lobule\|Classical hepatic lobule]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Portal lobule\|Portal lobule]] , and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatic acinus\|Hepatic acinus]]  ), each with their own emphasis.
