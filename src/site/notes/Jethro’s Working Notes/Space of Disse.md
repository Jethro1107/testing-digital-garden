### Space of Disse

The space of Disse is the perisinusoidal space between a plate of hepatocytes and the fenestrated endothelial cells that enables substance exchange.

Blood plasma is able to permeate the endothelial wall of [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Hepatic sinusoids\|Hepatic sinusoids]] and bath the microvilli on hepatocytes. This enables the exchange of material.

- Ito cells (hepatic stellate cells) are found in the space of Disse and perform several functions:
    - Vitamin A storage
    - Production of ECM (differentiation into myofibroblasts) in pathological conditions
