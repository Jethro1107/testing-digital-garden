### Interferon

### Interferons as an antiviral drug

- ************************************MOA of interferons************************************
    
    Interferons induce anti-viral state within cells:
    
    - This enables the cells to express anti-viral proteins that inhibit viral replication in many ways.
- **********************************************Pegylated interferons**********************************************
    
    Interferons used in pharmacological treatment of chronic [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Viral Hepatitis\|Viral Hepatitis]] are pegylated, i.e. conjugated with a ********************Polyethylene glycol:********************
    
    - This increases the duration of action of the drug
        
        Hence, only injection once a week for 6 months to a year is sufficient (contrasting injection 2-3 times a week without pegylation).
        
    - This also decreases the immunogenecity.
- ******************************************************************Peglyated interferon alpha-2a vs Pegylated interferon alpha-2b******************************************************************
    
    Pegylated interferons alpha-2a:
    
    - Administration of fixed weekly dose (dose adjustment by body weight is not required)
    - Relatively constant absorption after injection
    - Distributed mostly in blood and organs, such that the same concentration in liver is achieved regardless of body weight
    
    Pegylated interferons alpha-2b:
    
    - Weekly dose, with dose adjustment by body weight
    - Rapid absorption after injection
    - Wider distribution in body, such that change in bodyweight will result in change in concentration achieved in liver
- ******************************************************************************Adverse effect of pegylated interferons******************************************************************************
    
    Flu-like symptoms - headaches, fever, chills, muscle aches
    
    CNS disturbance - insomnia, depression
    
    GI disturbance
    
    Skin rash
