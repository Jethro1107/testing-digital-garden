### Implantation and Formation of Bilaminar Germ Disk (Second Week of Development)

- When does implantation start?
    
    At the end of week 1, around day 6
    
- What happens on day 8 of development?
    
    The embryoblast differentiates to two cell types: the dorsal epiblast and the ventral hypoblast
    
    This gives rise to the bilaminar germ disc
    
    Trophoblast also differentiate into two cell types: cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast
    
    Amniotic cavity is also formed
    
- How is the amniotic cavity formed? (day 8)
    
    Epiblast adjacent to cytotrophoblast and the epiblast layer encloses the amniotic cavity
    
- How is the exocoelomic cavity formed? (day 9)
    
    Cells originating from the hypoblast form the exocoelomic membrane lining the inner surface of the cytotrophoblast
    
    The exocoelomic membrane, together with hypoblast, encloses the exocoelomic cavity, otherwise known as the primitive yolk sac 
    
- Describe the formation of trophoblastic lacunae.
    
    Trophoblasts forms unfilled spaces called trophoblastic lacunae in the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms an interconnected network of hollow spaces
    
- What happens on day 9 of development?
    
    Formation of the exocoelomic cavity, and further development of trophoblast
    
    Trophoblast form unfilled spaces known as trophoblastic lacunae at the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms an interconnected network of hallow spaces
    
- How is the uteroplacenteal circulation established on day 11-12 of development?
    
    Syncytiotrophoblast further invade into the endometrial stroma, erroding maternal sinusoids
    
    Trophoblastic lacuncae becomes continuous with the maternal sinusoids, such that maternal blood flows into the lacunar system, completing the uteroplacenteal circulation
    
- What is the new layer between the inner surface of cytotrophoblast and the exocoelomic membrane? How is it further split into two layers?
    
    The new layer formed is the extraembryonic mesoderm
    
    It is further split into the visceral extraembryonic splanchnic mesoderm lining the yolk sac, and the parietal extraembryonic somatopleuric mesoderm lining the cytotrophoblast
    
    The cavity between the two layers is known as the extraembryonic cavity
    
- Describe the formation of the secondary yolk sac.
    
    Hypoblast proliferate to give more cells to line the inner surface of the exocoelomic membrane to enclose the secondary/definitive yolk sac
    
- Describe the formation of villous structures in the trophoblast.
    
    Cytotrophoblast proliferate and penetrate into the syncytiotrophoblast, forming columns covered by the syncytium
    
    These column structures are the primary villis
    

### Gastrulation and notochord formation

- What is gastrulation? When does gastrulation occur?
    
    Gastrulation is the process of establishing all three germ layers, the ectoderm, the mesoderm and the endoderm
    
    It starts at the third week of development
    
- How is the Cranial-Caudal Axis established?
    
    It is established by the formation of the primitive streak and node during gastrulation
    
    It is the movement of epiblast cells that result in the groove that forms the primitive streak and node
    
    The region with the primitive streak is the caudal region, while the region with the oropharyngeal membrane is the cranial region
    
    Thus, cranial-caudal axis is established
    
- How is Laterality established?
    
    Secretion of Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) by cells in the primitive streak and node stimulates the expression of Nodal (which reside on left side by the action of cilia of cells of the node) and Lefty2, which up-regulate the expression of transcription factor PITX2, a motor gene that establishes left-sidedness
    
    Pathway of establishment of right-sidedness is unclear, but is believed to be a result of expression of gene for Snail, the transcription factor for right-sidedness
    
- Describe the process of formation of the three germ layers.
    
    Epiblast cells migrate towards and through the primitive streak, displacing the hypoblast, and replacing it to form a new layer of cells called the endoderm
    
    Additional cells migrating through the primitive streak lies between the epiblast and endoderm to give rise to the mesoderm
    
    Cells remaining in the epiblast forms the ectoderm
    
- Describe the formation of notochordal plate and notochord
    
    Prenotochordal cells invaginate in the primative node and move along the midline cranially until it meets the prechordal plate at the endoderm to form the notochordal process
    
    The prenotochordal cells intercalate with the hypoblast to form the notochordal plate
    
    When epiblast invaginates in the primitive streak, the hypoblast is displaced and replaced by the endoderm
    
    The prenotochordal cells detach from the endoderm, the two edges of the notochordal plate come together to form a tube called the definitive notochord
    
    The conversion occurs at a cranial to caudal sequence, such that portions of the definitive notochord is formed at the cranial region first

- Describe the direction of mesoderm migration. Where is mesoderm not present?
    
    Move cranially and laterally
    
    Mesoderm is not present in the region of notochord, the oropharyngeal membrane
    
- What is the fate of the three germ layers?
    
    Ectoderm - Skin, CNS, PNS, eyes, internal ears, neural crest cells (which give rise to bones and connective tissues of the face and part of the skull)
    
    Mesoderm - bones, connective tissue, urogenital system, cardiovascular system
    
    Endoderm - Gut and gut derivatives (liver, pancreas, lungs etc.)
    

### Embryonic Period

- When is the embryonic period? What is the embryonic period characterised by?
    
    3rd to 8th week of development, it is characterised by the process of organogenesis, where the three germ layers give rise to specific tissues and organs
    
- What is neurulation?
    
    The process where neural plates form the neural tube
    
- Describe the process of neural plate induction.
    
    Notochord and prechordal mesoderm induces the overlying ectoderm to form the neural plate (neuroectoderm), thus initiating neurulation
    
    Notochord and prechordal mesoderm induces neural plate formation by secreting growth factors
    
    Prechordal mesoderm increases FGF secretion and decreases BMPS secretion, inducing forebrain and midbrain formation
    
    Notochord increases FGF and WNT3a secretion to induce formation of hindbrain and spinal cord
    
- Describe the formation of neural fold and neural groove.
    
    Elevation of the lateral edges of the neural plate forms the neural folds
    
    The depressed midline forms the neural groove
    
    Somites, formed in the mesoderm, appear along neural tube
    
- Describe the process of neural tube closure.
    
    Neural folds approach each other at the midline and fuse
    
    Fusion of neural folds first occur at the 5th somite (the neck region), and proceeds cranially and caudally
    
- What are the two neuropores? When do they close?
    
    Anterior neuropores - closes at day 25
    
    Posterior neuropore - closes at day 28
    
- What is the origin of neural crest cells?
    
    Originates from ectoderm, particularly at the lateral edges of neural tube
    
    The neural crest cells break off when neural folds fuse to give neural tube, and migrate along the side of the neural tube
    
- What are the functions of neural crest cells?
    
    Form neuroganglia
    
    Form Adrenal medulla
    
    Form melanocytes of the skin
    
    Form part of skull, dentin of teeth and some skeletal muscles
    
    Form mesenchyme
    
- Discuss the differentiation of the mesoderm to three parts, and what tissues it forms.
    
    Paraxial mesoderm (thickened layer medial to other layers) - somite
    
    Intermediate mesoderm - urogenital system and gonads
    
    Lateral plate mesoderm splits into two plates, the parietal mesoderm layer covering the amnion and the visceral mesoderm layer covering the yolk sac
    
- Describe the migration and differentiation of somites.
    
    Somites are derived from the paraxial mesoderm
    
    Somites differentiate into the sclerotome, dermatome and myotome
    
    Sclerotome move to the neural tube and eventually differentiate into vertebrae and ribs
    
    Myotome may migrate to the dorsomedial region or the ventrolateral region which eventually differentiate into muscles
    
    Some myotome may migrate to the parietal mesoderm layer and contribute to limb and body wall cavity
    
    The Dermatome sits between the ventrolateral myotome and the dorsomedial myotome and eventually differentiate into the dermis of the skin
    
- Describe the formation of the gut tube.
    
    The endoderm rolls ventrally to form the gut tube
    
- Describe lateral body folds.
    
    The visceral mesoderm layer rolls ventrally and is connected to the gut tube
    
    The parietal mesoderm layer and the overlying ectoderm move ventrally and meet in the midline to form the ventral body wall
    
- What generates the force for lateral body folding?
    
    Force is generated by proliferation in the endoderm and mesoderm, as well as migration of somite cells into parietal mesoderm layers
    
- Describe cranial and caudal body folds.
    
    The head and tail of embryo folds ventrally to allow the embryo to assume fetal position
    
    The two body folds allow the formation of the gut tube
    
- List the derivatives of endoderm.
    
    Gut and gut derivatives - pharyngeal pouches, epithelial lining of lung buds and trachea, liver, gallbladder and pancreas
