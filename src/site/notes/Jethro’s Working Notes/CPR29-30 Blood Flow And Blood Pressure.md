### Hemodynamics

- Functional parts of circulation
    - **Functions of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins**
        - Arteries - deliver oxygenated blood at high pressures to the tissues
        - Arterioles - regulate blood flow to capillaries in response to tissue needs
        - Capillaries - site of fluid and solute exchange between blood and interstitial fluid
        - Venules - Collect blood from capillary beds and converge into larger veins
        - Veins - return deoxygenated blood to the heart, accomodating a large volume of blood (64%)
- Velocity of blood flow
    - **Definition of flow rate**
        - Volume of blood flowing through a blood vessel per unit time
    - **Definition of velocity of blood flow**
        - Rate of displacement of blood in a vessel per unit time
        - Velocity of blood flow equals to flow rate divided by cross-sectional area

    - **Effect of area on velocity of blood flow**
        - Given that flow rate remains unchanged (Q is constant):
            - When cross-sectional area increase, velocity of blood flow decrease
            - When cross-sectional area decrease, velocity of blood flow increase
    - **Changes of velocity of blood flow in circulation and its significance**
        - Total blood flow at each level of circulation is the same and is equal to cardiac output
        - As aorta branches into arteries and into arterioles, total cross sectional area increases, and hence velocity of blood flow decrease
        - As arterioles branch into numerous branches of capillaries, total cross sectional area greatly increases, and hence veolocity of blood flow greatly decreases
        - This may be advantageous because the low velocity of blood flow in capillaries maximizes time for the exchange of fluid and solutes between blood and interstitial fluid
        - As capillaries converge into venules and into veins, the total cross sectional area decreases, and hence velocity of blood flow increases

- Flow rate
    - **Factors determining blood flow**
        - The driving force of blood flow is the pressure difference between two ends of the vessel, and resistance of blood vessel opposes blood flow
    - Resistance in circulation
        
        
        - **Determinants of resistance to blood flow**
            - Hagen-Poiseuille law states that the resistance of flow in an idealised system i.e. viscous fluid in a straight rigid, cylindrical, unbranched tube) is espressed by:

            - Resistance is directly proportional to viscosity of the blood and length of the vessel, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius
            - Radius of the blood vessel is the greatest determinant of resistance
        - **Limitations of Hagen-Poisseuille law in explaining haemodynamics**
            - Blood vessels are branched and are compliant and/or elastic, which does not fit the definition of an idealised system
            - Blood flow is not always laminar and steady, and can be turbulent and pulsatile
            - Viscosity of blood is not constant, but changes with velocity of blood flow. When velocity of blood flow increases, viscosity decreases as it prevents agglutination of erythrocytes
        - Serial and parallel resistance
            - **Serial arrangement of blood vessels and series resistance**
                - An organs blood vessels, i.e. arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins are arranged in series
                - The total series resistance of the system is equal to the sum of individual resistance:

            - **Parallel arrangement of blood vessels and resistance**
                - Arterioles and capillaries are arranged in parallel branches
                - The total parallel resistance of the system equals to:

                - The total parallel resistance is less than any of the individual resistances
                - Increasing the number of branches will decrease the total parallel resistance
            - **Compare total resistance of arterioles and capillaries**
                - While arterioles have a greater radius than capillaries, and thus have lower individual resistance than capillaries, the number of branches of arterioles is much less than that of capillaries, hence the total resistance of arterioles is greater than capillaries
                - Arterioles have the greatest resistance in circulation and contribute to most of series resistance to blood flow (and thus are called resistance vessels), evident by the rapid decrease in pressure in arterioles
    - Laminar flow and turbulent flow
        - Laminar flow
            - **What is laminar flow?**
                - Laminar flow has a parabolic velocity profile, where velocity of blood flow at the centre of the vessel is highest, and the velocity of blood flow at the vessel wall is lowest (zero)
        - Reynolds number and turbulent flow
            - **What is turbulent flow?**
                - Turbulent flow is when blood flow loses its parabolic velocity profile, instead the stream mix radially and axially, with irregular flow patterns such as whorls, eddies and vortices
                - Turbulent flow is also audible, as murmurs
            - **Where does turbulent flow normally occur?**
                - In blood vessels that are not perfectly cylindrical
                - Branching points of blood vessels
                - Ascending aorta in normal physiological conditions
            - Reynolds number on the tendancy of turbulent flow
                - **What is the Reynolds number?**
                    - A dimensionless number that predicts whether blood flow will be laminar or turbulent
                    - Reynolds number is directly proportional to the density of blood, the diameter of blood vessel and velocity of blood flow, and is inversely proportional to the viscosity of blood
                    - If Reynolds number (N R ) is less than 2000, blood flow will be laminar. If Reynolds number is greater than 2000, there is increasing likelihood that blood flow will be turbulent. Values greater than 3000 always predict turbulent flow
                - **Conditions that increase tendancy of turbulent flow according to Reynolds number**
                    - Decrease in viscosity of blood
                    - High velocity of blood flow
                    - Pulsatile blood flow
                    - Sudden decrease in vessel diameter (e.g. athrerosclerotic plaques, thrombi, emboli and valves) - Increase in velocity of blood flow is greater than decrease in diameter
    - Vascular tension and shear stress
        - Shear
            - **What is shear stress and its consequence?**
                - Shear is a frictional force developed from different velocity of flow between different layers of blood
                - Shear is greatest at the vessel wall, and lowest at the centre of blood vessels
                - Shear stress breaks up agglutinating red blood cells, such that red blood cells concentrate at the central axial region of vessels
        - Vascular tension
            - **Origin of vascular tension and its consequences**
                - Vascular tension develops in response to a transmural pressure gradient, causing the vessel wall to be stretched
                - According to Law of Laplace, tension is directly proportional to the transmural pressure gradient and radii of vessel, and inversely proportional to the wall thickness
                - Large vessels (with high radius) i.e. aorta are exposed to high pressure generated by the heart, and hence have to withstand with higher levels of tension, and thus must be reinforced by thick fibrous walls of collagen (Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology p. 180)
    - Pressures in cardiovascular system
        - Blood pressure is not the same at different parts of circulation, as if they are equal, blood would not flow, since flow requires a driving force (i.e. pressure difference)
        - **Pressure profile in vasculature**
            - The heart is a constant pressure generator as it produces cardiac output
            - Pressure is highest in the aorta, and decreases as blood flow through arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, veins and back to the heart
            - The pressure drop is due to energy consumed in overcoming the resistances
            - The greatest pressure drop is in arterioles, as resistance is highest in arterioles
        - Compliance of blood vessels
            - **Definition of compliance of blood vessels**
                - Compliance of blood vessels refers to its ability to increase its capacitance (volume) in response to an increase in intravascular pressure
            - **Compliance and elasticity of arteries and their origin**
                - Arteries have lower compliance than veins as arterial walls have more collagen fibres than venous walls, such that they are less able to stretch, and holds less blood at high pressure (stressed volume)
                - Arteries have high elasticity than veins as arterial walls have more elastic fibres than venous walls, such that they are more able to recoil after being stretched
            - **Compliance of veins**
                - Veins have higher compliance than arteries due to a modest amount of collagen and elastic fibre, and thus hold more blood at low pressures (unstressed volume)
- Arterial pressure
    - Pulsation of arterial pressure
        - **Origin of pulsation of arterial pressure in aorta**
            - During ventricular systole, blood is ejected from the left ventricle
            - When bood enters the aorta, a small amount of blood leaves the aorta immediately, but most of the blood remain in the aorta, stretching the compliant aorta
            - This causes an **increase in aortic pressure**
            - During ventricular diastole, the stretched aorta recoils
            - A minor backflow of blood closes the aortic valve, and a large portion blood is pushed to downstream arteries, causing a **decrease in aortic pressure**
        - **Effects of arterial compliance on pulsation of arterial pressure and blood flow**
            - As pulse pressure is determined by the ratio between stroke volume and compliance:
            - A decrease in compliance (rigid arteries, seen in arteriosclerosis or aging), will cause an increase in pulse pressure, and a decrease in blood flow during diastole (Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology p.185)
            - An increase in compliance will result in a decrease in pulse pressure, as build up of pressure is offset by stretching of arteries, and increase in blood flow during diastole

        - Transmission of pressure pulses to peripheral arteries
    - Systolic and diastolic pressure
        - **Definition of systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and pulse pressure**
            - Systolic pressure - Maximal arterial pressure attained at peak ventricular ejection
            - Diastolic pressure - minimum arterial pressure attained just before ventricular ejection
            - Pulse pressure - Difference between systolic pressure and diastolic pressure
        - **Ranges of blood pressure in normal, prehypertension and hypertension**

            - **Factors affecting mean arterial pressure**
                - Mean arterial pressure depends on [Cardiac [[Jethro’s Working Notes/CPR29-30 Blood Flow And Blood Pressure\|]] (flow rate) and total vascular resistance

### Regulation of blood flow and blood pressure

- **Key factor of regulation of blood flow and blood pressure**
    - Blood vessel radius is the key factor of regulation of blood flow and blood pressure
- Control of blood flow
    - **Function of the circulation and relations to regulating blood flow**
        - To maintain optimal environment to most tissues, hence local blood flow is regulated based on specific needs
        - In most tissues:
            - Deliver oxygen, water and nutrients
            - Deliver platelets and WBC
            - Deliver hormones
            - Remove metabolic waste
        - In kidneys:
            - To regulate fluid balance
        - In skin:
            - Thermoregulation
    - **Types of microcirculation in body**
        - Usually just arterioles ⇒ Capillaries ⇒ Venules
        - Precapillary sphincter and metarterioles (shunts) can only be found in messenteric and brain circulation
        - Arteriovenous anastamosis can only be found in skin and extremities
        The idealised microcirculatory circuit is **NOT** the norm

    - **Key factor for controlling local blood flow and the effector organ**
        - Radius of the blood vessel is the key factor for controlling local blood flow, which is determined by the contractility of vascular smooth muscle in tunica media of arterioles, i.e. Local blood flow is regulated by the contractile state of the arteriole smooth muscles
        - **Contractile mechanism of smooth muscle contraction by filament interaction**
            - Thin filament (actin) is bound to dense bodies on intermediate filaments (vimentin and desmin)
            - Thick filament (myosin) forms side-pole crossbridges with 2 different actin filaments
            - When smooth muscle contracts, myosin pull the 2 actin filaments in opposite direction, allowing them to slide past one another, bring the two dense bodies close together
        - **Molecular basis of smooth muscle contraction**
            - Smooth muscle contraction is initiated by increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, caused by influx of Ca2+, triggering CICR from sarcoplasmic reticulum
            - Ca2+ binds reversibly to calmoudulin to form calcium-calmoudulin complex
            - Calcium-calmoudulin complex acrivates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)
            - Once activated, MLCK phosphorylates myosin heads, which repititively bind to actin filaments, resulting in muscle contraction

        - **Molecular basis of smooth muscle relaxation**
            - Smooth muscle relaxation is triggered by a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ levels
            - Sequesteration of Ca2+ into SR via SERCA2a and pumping of Ca2+ into extracellular fluid via Ca2+-ATPase and Na+/Ca+ exchanger cause a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ levels
            - Ca2+ dissociate from calmoudulin, decreasing activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)
            - Myosin phosphatase dephosphorylates the myosin head, stopping actin-myosin interaction, resulting in relaxation
        - **Molecular basis of regulating smooth muscle contractility**
            - Smooth muscle contractility can be regulated by altering:
                - Intracellular Ca2+ levels - Increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels result in increased Calcium-calmoudurin complex and hence increased MLCK activity
                - Myosin light chain kinase activity - Phosphorylated MLCK is less sensitive to activation by calcium-calmoudurin complex
        - Mechanisms for regulation smooth muscle contractility to regulate blood flow
            - **Intrinsic mechanism**
                - Myogenic mechanisms
                    - **Myogenic mechanism in regulating blood flow**
                        - An increase in arterial pressure causes increase in tension on vessel wall of arterioles
                        - Stretching of vessel walls initiate stretch-induced vascular depolarization by opening stretch-sensitive ion channels
                        - This results in an influx of Ca2+ from extracellular fluid, causing an increase in intracellular Ca2+ level, causing an increase in Calcium-calnoudulin complex, an increase in MLCK activity and increased in smooth muscle contractility

                        - This decreases the radius and thus decreases the vascular tension according to Law of Laplace

                        - This also increases resistance and thus decreases blood flow
                - Tissue metabolic rate
                    - **Mechanism of tissue metabolic rate in regulating blood flow**
                        - When tissue metabolic rate increase, it results in a decrease in PO2 and a subsequent release of adenosine (from degradation of ATP), a vasodilator
                        - Decreased PO2 causes smooth muscle relaxation, allowing for vasodilation, and thus increase in tissue blood flow
                        - Adenosine causes vasodilation, and thus increase in tissue blood flow, but it causes vasoconstriction of renal afferent arterioles
                - Paracrine mediators
                    - **Examples of endothelium derived vasoactive ingredients**
                        - Nitric oxide
                            - **Production, intracellular pathway and action of nitric oxide**
                                - Production of NO by endothelial NO synthase from arginine and O2 in endothelial cells, which is promoted by shear stress due to increased blood flow, and agonist (histamine, acetylcholine)
                                - NO is lipophilic, and difuses into VSMC to activate soluble guanylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of cGMP
                                - cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase G, which phosphorylate MLCK, causing decreased activity of MLCK
                                - Protein kinase G also phosphorylate SERCA, increasing sequesteration of Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels
                                - This results in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation

                        - Prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin)
                            - **Intracellular pathway and action of prostaglandin I2**
                                - Prostaglandin I2 binds to IP receptors on vascular smooth muscles, resulting in increased adenyl cyclase activity, resulting in the increased levels of cAMP
                                - Increased levels of cAMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates MLCK, causing decreased activity of MKCK
                                - This results in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation
                        - Endothelin-1
                            - **Production, intracellular pathway and action of endothelin-1**
                                - Released of endothelin-1 by endothelial cells when they are injured
                                - Endothelin-1 binds to ETa receptors, activating phospholipase C, resulting in the formation of IP3
                                - IP3 binds to IP3 receptors on sarcoplastic reticulum, resulting in Ca2+ release, and increase Calcium-calmoudurin complex and increased MLCK activity
                                - This results in smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction, contributing to haemostasis in response to injury
            - Extrinsic mechanism
                - **Innervation of vascular smooth muscle**
                    - Unitary/single-unit smooth muscle (most blood vessels) - A unitary smooth muscle consist of many VSMC connected by gap junctions, and innervated by one autonomic neuron, as they contract as one unit
                    - Multiunit smooth muscle (elastic arteries) - VSMC are not connected by gap junctions and each synapse with their own autonomic neuron
                - **Neural and endocrine vasoconstrictors, intracellular pathway and action**
                    - Norepinephrine:
                        - Binds to alpha-1 receptors on VSMC, stimulating phospholipase C, resulting in the formation of IP3
                        - IP3 binds to IP3 receptors on sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in Ca2+ release, increasing formation of Calcium calmoudurin complex and increased MLCK activity
                        - This results in smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction
                    - Angiotensin II:
                        - Binds to angiotensin II type-1 receptors on VSMC, stimulating phospholipase C, resulting in increased IP3
                        - IP3 binds to IP3 receptors on sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in Ca2+ release, increasing formation of Calcium calmoudurin complex and increased MLCK activity
                        - This results in smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction
                - **Neural and endocrine vasodilators, intracellular pathway and action**
                    - Epinephrine:
                        - Binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors, activating adenyl cyclase, resulting in formation of cAMP
                        - This activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylate MLCK, causing decreased MLCK activity
                        - This results in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation
                    - Acetylcholine:
                        - Binds to M3 receptors on endothelial cells of blood vessels in erectile tissues, increasing NO production
                        - NO diffuses into VSMC and binds to guanylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of cGMP
                        - This activates protein kinase G, phosphorylating MLCK, decreasing MLCK activity
                        - It also phosphorylate SERCA, increasing SERCA activity and decreasing intracellular Ca2+ levels
                        - This results in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation

### Special circulations

- Splanchnic circulation
    - **Proportion of blood flow to splanchnic circulation**
        - 15%
    - **Effects of sympathetic activity to blood flow to splanchnic circulation**
        - When sympathetic activity, norepinephrine wil bind to alpha-1 receptors on smooth muscles, resulting in smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction, diverting blood flow from splanchnic circulation
    - **Effects of a meal to to blood flow to splanchnic circulation**
        - When an individual thinks about food, the CNS initiates an anticipatory response to increase blood flow
        - During digestion, there is increased parasympathetic activity, resulting in increased GI metabolism, resulting in decreased PO2 and adenosine production
        - This causes vasodilation and increases splanchnic blood flow
- Coronary circulation
    
    
    - **Effects on systole on coronary blood flow in the 2 periods of a heart beat**
        - During systole, coronary vessels (intramural arteries) are compressed, resulting in decreased blood flow in systole
        - Hence, coronary blood flow is higher in diastole

    - **Effects of sympathetic activity on coronary blood flow**
        - Sympathetic activity results in increased heart rate, resulting in shortening of diastole, decreasing time for maximal coronary perfusion
        - However, metabolic rate of cardiac muscles increase in increased heart rate, resulting in decreased PO2 and increased adenosine production, resulting in vasodilation, and increased coronary blood flow
        - The net effect is increased coronary blood flow
        - Prolonged sympathetic activity will result in further vasodilation, as epinephrine released from adrenal medulla arrive at coronary circulation
    - **Response to coronary artery narrowing resulting in reduced blood flow**
        - Collateral coronary vessels develop to increase blood flow
- Skeletal muscle circulation
    - **Effects of exercise on skeletal muscle blood flow**
        - During exercise, increased sympathetic activity results in vasoconstriction of blood vessels, resulting in reduced blood flow to inactive muscles
        - Active muscles increase their metabolic rate, resulting in decreased PO2 and increased adenosine production, resulting in vasodilation, which outweighs vasoconstriction effects caused by increased sympathetic activity
        - As a result, this results in increased blood flow to active muscles
        - Further more, increased sympathetic activity diverts blood flow from splanchnic circulation, resulting in further increase in skeletal muscle blood flow
- Control of blood flow to special circulations during exercise
    - Decreased splanchnic blood flow
    - Increased coronary blood flow
    - Increased blood flow to active muscle and decreased blood flow to inactive muscle

### Response to changes in blood pressure/volume

- Response to acute change in blood pressure
    - [**Baroreceptor [[Jethro’s Working Notes/CPR29-30 Blood Flow And Blood Pressure\|]]  response to increase in blood pressure**
        - Increase in blood pressure stimulates baroreceptors, stimulating parasympathetic activity and inhibiting sympathetic activity
        - This results in a decrease in heart rate and stroke volume, and hence a decrease in cardiac output
        - The decreased sympathetic activity also results in decreased arterial vasoconstriction via stimulation of alpha-1 receptors on VSMC, or vasodilation, and hence a decrease in total peripheral resistance
        - Hence, mean mean arterial pressure decreases
    - **Chemoreceptor reflex response to decrease in blood pressure**
        - A decrease in blood pressure results in decreased blood flow to the aortic bodies, carotid bodies and the brain, stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors
        - This results in increased sympathetic activity
        - Cardiac output and total vascular resistance increase
        - Mean arterial pressure increase
- Response to acute change in blood volume
    - **Bainbridge reflex response to increase in blood volume**
        - Increase in blood volume would increase venous return, resulting in increased preload and stretching of the right atrium
        - Volume receptors on right atrium are stimulated, which results in increased heart rate (to increase heart rate and increase renal perfusion for fluid excretion)
        
        Boron & Boulpaep Chapter 23:
        [Low-pressure baroreceptors in the atria respond to increased “fullness” of the vascular system, triggering tachycardia, renal vasodilation, and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/CPR29-30 Blood Flow And Blood Pressure\|]]
        
    - **Baroreceptor reflex response to increase in blood volume**
        - Increase in blood volume would result in increase venous pressure, resulting in increased preload and increased cardiac output
        - Increased cardiac output results in increase in mean arterial pressure, stimulating baroreceptors
        - When baroreceptors are stimulated, it results in decreased sympathetic activity and hence decreased heart rate
    - **Net effect of baroreceptor reflex and bainbridge reflex in response to increase in blood volume**
        - When initial heart rate is low, bainbridge reflex predominates, such that the net effect is increased heart rate
        - When initial heart rate is high, baroreceptor reflex predominates, such that the net effect is decreased heart rate
    - **Response to chronic increase in blood pressure**
        - Inward eutrophic remodelling:
        For arteries that undergo vasoconstriction, chronic hypertension results in high vascular tension, will result in prolonged vasoconstriction to reduce tension (myogenic theory)
        Under prolonged vasoconstriction, the VSMC will rearrange around the constricted lumen
        Vessel wall thickens, resulting in decreased compliance and elasticity of the vessel, and hence increased resistance
        - Outward hypertrophic remodelling:
        If vasoconstriction is not sufficient to reduce vascular tension, it results to hypertrophic remodelling
        VSMC increase in size
        There is deposition of extracellular matrix
        Vessel wall thickens, resulting in decreased compliance and elasticity of the vessel, and hence increased resistance
