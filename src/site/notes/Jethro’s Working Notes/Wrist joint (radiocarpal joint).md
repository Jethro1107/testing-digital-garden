### Wrist joint (radiocarpal joint)

The wrist joint involves the articulation between the distal end of the ardius and the articular disc at the distal end of the ulna (triangular fibrocartilage), to the scaphoid, lunate and triquetral (proximal rows of the carpals, [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Bones of the hand and the arches of the hand\|Bones of the hand and the arches of the hand]]).

- **Classification of the wrist joint**
    
    The wrist joint is classified as a synovial ellipsoid joint.
    
- **Movement of the wrist joint**
    
    The wrist joint enables:
    
    - Flexion and extension - facilitated by midcarpal joints

    - Abduction and adduction
        
        Note that adduction can occur at a greater angle than that of the abduction as the styloid process of the radius extends more distally, and blocks abduction.
