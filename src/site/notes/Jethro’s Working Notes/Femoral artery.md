### Femoral artery

The femoral artery is the continuation of the external iliac artery as it emerges from the mid-inguinal point into the thigh.

- ************************In the thigh************************
    
    The femoral artery is found in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femoral triangle\|Femoral triangle]], and forms the lateral border of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femoral sheath\|Femoral sheath]].
    
    - ************************************************In the thigh, the femoral artery gives off an immediate branch called the deep femoral artery.************************************************
        
        The deep femoral artery gives rise to the medial and lateral circumflex femoral artery which anastamose at the femoral neck, and 4 perforating arteries.
        
        Particularly, the circumflex femoral artery and 1st perforating branch of deep profundus artery partakes in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hip joint anastamosis\|Hip joint anastamosis]].
        
    
    It leaves the femoral triangle by passing through a muscular space, the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Adductor canal\|Adductor canal]].
    
    It then leaves the adductor canal through the adductor hiatus, between the insertion of the 2 portions of the adductor magnus muscle, emerging posteriorly.
