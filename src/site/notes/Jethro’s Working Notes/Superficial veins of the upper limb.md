### Superficial veins of the upper limb

Venous drainage of the subcutaneous tissue of the upper limb is provided by 2 superficial veins: 1) *****Cephalic vein,***** 2) *************Basilic vein.*************

- **************************Cephalic vein**************************
    
    The cephalic vein arises from the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomical snuffbox\|Anatomical snuffbox]], on the dorsolateral side of the base of the thumb, where it courses back onto the anterior side of the forearm and arm. The cephalic vein courses along the deltopectoral groove and triangle, where it drains into the axillary vein (a deep vein).
    
- ******************Basilic vein******************
    
    The basilic vein arises from the ulnar side of the hand, where it courses back onto the anterior side of the forearm and arm. It continues its course along the medial side of the arm, and joins the brachial vein to form the axillary vein.
    
- ****************************************In the Cubital fossa****************************************
    
    In the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cubital fossa\|Cubital fossa]], the cephalic vein and basilic vein communicate via a the medial cephalic vein.
    

Along their courses, superficial veins may communicate with each other via communicating veins, or penetrate the deep fascia and drain into deep veins by perforating veins.
