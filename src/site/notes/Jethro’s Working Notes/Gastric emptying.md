### Gastric emptying

Gastric emptying is the ****************************************************************************************slow, controlled release of chyme from the stomach into the duodenum, at a rate suitable for proper [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Digestive and absorption\|Digestive and absorption]] by the small intestine**.

- **Gastric emptying is is promoted by the pyloric pump and the relaxation of the pyloric sphincter**
    
    Pyloric pump is the intense constricting ring of contraction in the antrum (much stronger than the peristaltic contractions in [[Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme\|Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme]]), that pressurize the chyme, and squeezes the food through the pyloric opening into the duodenum.
    
    Pyloric sphincter, the thickened inner circular muscle layer in the stomach ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Histology of the stomach\|Histology of the stomach]]), is normally tonically contracted, but its degree of contraction can be altered by gastric factors and intestinal factors, which regulate gastric emptying.

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intestinal factors inhibit gastric emptying\|Intestinal factors inhibit gastric emptying]]
