### Infective endocarditis

- **What is infective endocarditis?**
    
    Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the heart valves or the mural endocardium that leads to the formation of vegetations composed of thrombotic debris and organisms, often associated with destruction of the underlying cardiac tissue
    
- **Risk factors of infective endocarditis**
    
    While infective endocarditis can occur in previously normal valves, cardiac abnormalities and diseased valves predispose to such infections
    
    Congenital heart disease:
    
    Septal defect
    
    Valvular defect (e.g. congenital bicuspid valves)
    
    Acquired diseases:
    
    Degenerative valve diseases
    
    Rheumatic heart disease
    
    Mitral valve prolapse
    
    Prosthetic valve
    
    Host factors such as neutropenia, immunodeficiency, malignancies, diabetes mellitus and **Intravenous Drug Abuse** also predispose to infective endocarditis
    
- **Clinical presentation of infective endocarditis**
    
    
    Non specific:
    
    Fever
    
    Malaise
    
    Weight loss
    
    Night sweat
    
    Clubbing
    
    Emboli/Metastatic infections:
    
    Myocardial infarction
    
    Stroke (most important complication, accounts for 10-20% of IE)
    
    Splenic infarct (presents with left upper abdominal pain)
    
    Mycotic aneurysm
    
    Osteomyelitis (commonly involve vertebrae, presenting with back pain)
    
    Damaged valves:
    
    Heart failure
    
    Murmur (constantly changing as vegetation continuously grows)
    
    Immunological reactions:
    
    Glomerulonephritis
    
    Classical signs (rare, but extremely indicative of IE):
    
    Splinter haemorrhages
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    Osler’s nodes - Tender subcutaneous nodules on tip of fingers and toes
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]

    - Staphylococcus
    - Viridans streptococci
    - Streptococcus bovis (S. gallolyticus/Biotype I)
    - Enterococci
    - Fastidious (slow growing on traditional culture) gram negative bacilli - HACEK group
        
        **H**aemophilus
        
        **A**ctinobacillus
        
        **C**ardiobacterium hominis
        
        **E**ikenella corrodens
        
        **K**ingella kingae/**K**ingella denitrificans
        
    
    Prosthetic valves:
    
    Early onset (Within 12 months) - Coagulase negative staphylococcus
    
    Late onset (beyond 12 months) - similar etiology of native valves
    
    - **Rare etiology of infective endocarditis**
        
        Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) - farm animal

- Treatment of infective endocarditis
    - Antibiotics
        - **Principles of antibiotic treatment against infective endocarditis**
            
            To effectively treat infective endocarditis. it requires:
            
            1. Effective antibiotic (i.e. bactericidal)
            2. High dose intravenous route (to penetrate vegetations)
            3. Long duration (to kill dormant bacteria in infective foci)
            
            Short term therapy is associated with relapse
            
        - **Why is treatment of infective endocarditis difficult?**
            
            Bacteria are embedded in biofilm, such that they are protected from exposure from antibiotics and phagocytes
            
            There is high bacterial load within vegetations
            
            Bacteria remain dormant with low metabolic activity and cell division, such that a long duration therapy is required
            
        - **Common antibiotics used for treatment against infective endocarditis**
            
            Viridans streptococci - Penicillin G
            
            Staphylococcus (methicillin sensitive) - cloxacillin
            
            Staphylococcus (methicillin resistant) - vancomycin
            
            Enterococcus - ampicillin and gentamycin
            
            If Enterococcus faecalis and ampicillin sensitive, can also consider ampicillin and ceftriaxone
            
            If prosthetic valve endocarditis due to staphylococcus - Add rifampicin for added penetration through biofilm 
            
    - Surgery
- Prevention of infective endocarditis
    
    Good dental hygiene
    
    Some countries make use of antibiotics prophylaxis before procedures
