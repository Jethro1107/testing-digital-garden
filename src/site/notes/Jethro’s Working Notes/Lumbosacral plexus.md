The lumbosacral plexus is a somatic nerve plexus where some branches provide motor and sensory innervation to the lower limb. ************************************************************************It is classified into the lumbar plexus and the sacral plexus.************************************************************************

### Lumbar plexus
The lumbar plexus are formed by the anterior rami of L1 to L3, and part of the anterior rami of L4.
The lumbar plexus lies deep to the psoas major.
Most branches supply the lower limb and the anterolateral abdominal wall.

### Sacral plexus
Sacral plexus is formed by the remaining part of the anterior rami of L4, and the anterior rami of L5, together forming the **********************lumbosacral trunk**********************, and the anterior rami of S1 to S3.

The sacral plexus is found in the pelvic cavity, largely *anterior to the piriformis*.

Most branches of the sacral plexus supply the lower limb, and is hence considered a true plexus of the lower limb. 

Some branches also supply the perineum (pudendal nerve), while the pelvic splanchnic nerve provides parasympathetic outflow to the the inferior hypogastric plexus.
