### Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans

Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans are soluble fibres of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cartilage matrix\|Cartilage matrix]].

- **********************************Glycosaminoglycan**********************************
    
    Glycosaminoglycan is a linear polymer consisting of a disaccharide subunit:
    
    - One subunit is either N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine,
    - The other is D-glucuronic acid or L-iduronic acid.
    
    They may exist freely, e.g. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hyaluronic acid\|Hyaluronic acid]], or as GAG side chains in proteoglycans, e.g. Chondroitin sulphate, heparan sulphate, keratan sulphate, dermatan sulphate.
    
- ************************Proteoglycan************************
    
    Proteoglycan consist of a core protein with Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains covalently attached.
    
    There are in general 2 groups of proteogycans:
    
    - Lecticans (large proteoglycans) - Aggrecans, Brevican, Neurocan, Versican
        
        Many GAG attach to a protein core.
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - Small leucine repeat proteoglycans - Decorin, Biglycan, Lumicans
        
        These are small proteoglycans with few GAG side chains attached to the protein core.

- ********************************************************It is the glycosaminoglycan moiety that serves mechanical functions for cartilage: [[Jethro’s Working Notes/EditLater\|EditLater]] (how compressive resistance translates to shock absorption: also correlate to IV disc notes somehow, not that important)**
    
    The hydroxyl group of amine sugars of glycosaminoglycan can be sulphated, resulting in predominant negative charge of glycosaminoglycan.
    
    GAGs can hence attract cations, which in turn makes them hydrophilic, providing swelling pressure.
    
    This provides compressive resistance, and shock absorption in cartilage.
