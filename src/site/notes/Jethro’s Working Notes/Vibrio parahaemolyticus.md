### Vibrio parahaemolyticus

- **Epidemiology of Vibrio parahaemolyticus**
    
    Vibrio parahaemolyticus is transmitted via foodborne transmissions (seafood), and is associated with community outbreaks.
    
    It is a common cause of food borne bacterial GI infections in Hong Kong, even more common in the summer.
    
- **Pathogenesis of Vibrio parahaemolyticus**
    
    It is usually mediated by enterotoxins, and sometimes an inflammatory response.
    
- **Clinical presentation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection**
    
    Incubation period of around 12-24 hours (relatively short incubation period).
    
    It usually presents with watery diarrhea, rarely results in dysentery.
    
    It is accompanied with Abdominal pain and fever (Abdominal and systemic symptoms).
    
- **Diagnosis of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection**
    
    Bacterial diagnosis is made by stool culture on TCBS medium ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/TCBS medium differentiates Vibrio species\|TCBS medium differentiates Vibrio species]]), which results in green colonies.
