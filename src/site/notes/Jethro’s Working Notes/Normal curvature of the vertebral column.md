### Normal curvature of the vertebral column

The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Vertebral column\|Vertebral column]] is not a straight structure, but consist of curvatures at different regions, notably: cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, sacral kyphosis.

Kyphosis refers to the curvature that concaves anteriorly, while lordosis refers to the curvature that concaves posteriorly.

Thoracic kyphosis and sacral kyphosis are considered to be ************************************primary curvatures************************************, as they develop during fetal period.

Cervical lordosis and lumbar lordosis are considered to be **secondary curvatures**, as they develop during infancy and childhood (from the extension of flexed fetal positiosn). This is why people consider the first time babies raise their heads or sit up to be major achievements.
