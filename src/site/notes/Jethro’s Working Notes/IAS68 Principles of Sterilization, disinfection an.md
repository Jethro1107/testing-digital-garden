### Infection Control

- What is infection control?
    
    Preventing or stopping the spread of infection in healthcare settings
    
- What are the three common vehicles of transmission in hospital setting?
    
    Contact, Droplet, Airborne
    
- How is droplet transmission and airborne transmission distinguished?
    
    Droplet transmission - Transmitted by respiratory droplets (>5 microns in diameter)
    
    Airborne transmission - Transmitted by droplet nuclei of evaporated aerosols (<5 microns)
    
    However, size cut off may not be accurate for predicting transmission route 
    
    Airborne transmission is facilitated by:
    
    - Activities of infected person (singing)
    - Activities on infected patients (intubation, CPR)
    - Environment
    - The pathogen
- How does infection control work?
    
    A two-tier system of precaution
    
    Tier 1 - Standard precaution for all patients
    
    Tier 2 - Transmission based precautions for patients suspected or confirmed to have a type of infectious diseases with risk of transmission
    
    Three types of transmission based precautions based on the possible transmission route:
    
    1. Contact Precaution
    2. Droplet Precaution
    3. Airborne Precaution
- What is the assumption in standard precaution? What does it include?
    
    **Assumption: Blood, Mucosa and body fluid of all patients should be considered infectious**
    
    Package includes:
    
    1. Hand hygiene
    2. Use of PPE when exposed to infectious material, medical mask usage in patient contact
    3. Proper handling of needles and other sharps
    4. Respiratory hygiene/Cough etiquette
    5. Appropriate patient placement
    6. Cleaning and disinfection of patient environment and equipment
    7. Handling of textiles and laundry
    8. Safe injection practice
- What are the two types of hand hygiene?
    1. Disinfecting soap and water:
        
        Used with visibly soiled hands (by blood, body fluid or stool)
        
        Or after contact with patient with C. difficile colitis and norovirus infection
        
        Surgical antisepsis used
        
        Time consuming
        
    2. Alcohol based hand rub
        
        Used when hands are not visibly soiled
        
        WHO-approved formulations with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol used
        
        Less time consuming
        
- What are the 5 moments of hand hygiene according to the WHO?
    
    Before touching patient
    
    Before anticeptic procedure
    
    After body fluid exposure risk
    
    After touching patient
    
    After touching patient surroundings
    
- What are the components of personal protective equipment?
    
    Gloves + Gown (Minimum requirement)
    
    Surgical Mask
    
    Goggles
    
    Face shield
    
    Hairnet
    
- Describe the precautions of contact precaution.
    
    **Patient placement:**
    
    - In single room with closed door
    - Cohorting with patients with the same infection
    - Limited movement or transfer of patients
    - Dedicated equipments
    
    **PPE:**
    
    - Glove and gown always required
    - Goggles, face shield and hairnet if exposure to body fluids is anticipated
    
    **Environment:**
    
    - Regular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and equipment
    - Terminal cleaning after patient leaves

- Describe the precautions in droplet precaution.
    
    **Patient Placement:**
    
    - Single room with closed doors, but cohorting with patients with the same infection is possible
    - Patients should wear masks
    - Educate patient on cough etiquette
    
    **PPE:**
    
    - Wear mask upon entry into patient space
    - Gown and gloves required for some respiratory viral infections (RSV)

- Describe the precautions in Airborne precaution.
    
    **Patient Placement:**
    
    - Patients must be placed in an airborne infection isolation room with negative pressure relative to surroundings (preventing air to flow out of the room)
    - Instruct patients to wear masks and follow cough etiquette
    - Limited patient transports
    
    **PPE:**
    
    - Fit-tested N95 mask in addition to other PPE
    - Staff should be immune to measles and Varicella Zoster Virus

### Sterilization and Disinfection

- Define Sterilization, Disinfection (All three levels), Cleaning and Decontamination.
    
    Sterilization - A physical or chemical procedure to completely eliminate or destroy all microbial life including spores
    
    Disinfection - A physical or chemical procedure performed on inanimate objects that destroys most pathogenic microbes:
    
    High-level disinfection - Kill all microbes except a large number of bacterial spores
    
    Intermediate-level disinfection - Kill mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, most fungi and most viruses
    
    Low-level disinfection - Kill most vegetative bacteria, some fungi and some virus
    
    Cleaning - Removal of visible soil achieved by manual or machanical means, a necessary prerequisite for sterilization and disinfection
    
    Decontamination - Procedures that remove pathogenic microorganisms from objects such that they are safe to handle, use or discard
    
- Separate germicide, antiseptic and disinfectants.
    
    Germicide - Agents that can kill microorganisms
    
    Antiseptics - Germicides applied to living tissue and skin
    
    Disinfectants - Germicides applied to inanimate objects
    
- What is the Spaulding's classification of sterilization and disinfection of equipment?
    
    Non-critical devices (contact with intact skin) - Requires low level or intermediate level disinfection
    
    Semi-critical devices (contact with non-intact skin or mucous membranes) - Requires high-level disinfection
    
    Critical devices (Contact with sterile area of body including blood) - Requires sterilization 
    
- What are the different ways of killing microbes?
    
    Physical:
    
    Heat, radiation, filtration (remove, not kill)
    
    Chemical:
    
    Disinfectant or sterilant depends on concentration and exposure time
    
- What is the most common sterilant?
    
    Heat
    
- What are the different chemical sterilants and disinfectants?
    
    Aldehyde:
    
    Glutaraldehyde (high-level disinfectant, irritating, higher exposure time makes it a sterilant)
    
    Formaldehyde (higher concentration makes it a sterilant)
    
    Ortho-phthalaldehyde (high-level disinfectant, better than glutaraldehyde for inactivating mycobacteria)
    
    Halogens:
    
    Chlorine releasing agents (Environmental disinfectants)
    
    Iodine (Antisepsis)
    
    Iodophore (Antisepsis, same activity as iodine but no irritant and does not stain skin)
    
    Chlorhexidine - Highly active against G+ bacteria, and less active against G- bacteria, fungicidal, but limited activity against mycobacteria, spores and non-envoloped virus (Skin antiseptic, residual effect after washing away)
    
    Alcohols - Non-sporucidal, poor penetrative powers, no residual effect, for disinfection of clean surfaces and skin)
