Pulmonary physiology refers to how our respiratory system carries out its main function: gas exchange, i.e. the exchange of O2 and CO2 between the body and the external environment.

Other than gas exchange, [[the respiratory system also performs other functions.\|the respiratory system also performs other functions.]]

To understand pulmonary physiology, it is best to first visualize the route O2 takes when it moves from the atmosphere into our body cells. O2 first has to move from the atmosphere into the alveoli by means of ventilation, where it has to diffuse across the respiratory membrane to reach the blood. O2 then travels via blood and reach peripheral cells. CO2 travels in the opposite direction. One should also understand how breathing is controlled.
