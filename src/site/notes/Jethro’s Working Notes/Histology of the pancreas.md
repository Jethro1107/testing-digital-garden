### Histology of the pancreas

The overall histological architecture of the pancreas is described below:

- A thick connective tissue capsule surrounds the parenchyma.
- The capsule forms extended septa that extends into the parenchyma, separating the the parenchyma into lobules.

The pancreas parenchyma consist of the exocrine pancreas (occupies much of the bulk of the parenchyma) and the endocrine pancreas.

### Histological architecture of the exocrine pancreas parenchyma

The parenchyma is made of pancreatic acini and the ductal system.

Pancreatic acini

- The pancreatic acini consist of serous cells (protein-secreting cells) and a small lumen.

Ductal system

- Central acinar cells - Centrally located nucleus with pale cytoplasm, located at the centre of the pancreatic acini, is involved, in producing a bicarbonate-rich secretion
- The ductal system starts with the intercalated ducts, which is lined with a simple squamous to low cuboidal epithelium, which is also involved in producing a bicarbonate-rich secretion. ([[Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids\|Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids]]).
- The intercalated ducts drain into the intralobular duct, interlobular ducts and eventually into the main pancreatic duct that drains into the duodenum. Histologically, there is a change from simple cuboidal to simple columnar epithelium.

### Histological architecture of the endocrine pancreas parenchyma

The endocrine pancreas are made of cluster of cells called islet of Langherans.

The islet of Langherans consist of 4 cell types:

- Alpha cells
    
    Alpha cells usually locate around the periphery of the islet, accounting 15-20% of islet population.
    
    Alpha cells are involved in production of glucagon.
    
- Beta cells
    
    Beta cells are usually located at the centre of the islet, accounting 60-70% of the islet population.
    
    Beta cells are involved in production of insulin.
    
- Delta cells
    
    Delta cells account for 10% of the islet population. 
    
    Delta cells are involved in secretion of somatostatins, which affect GI functions and inhibit insulin and glucagon secretions.
    
- Pancreatic polypeptide cells
    
    Pancreatic polypeptide cells secret pancreatic polypeptides, which affect GI functions.
