### Brachial plexus

The brachial plexus is the bundle of nerves (a somatic nerve plexus) that innervate the muscles and skin of the upper limb. The brachial plexus originates from the anterior rami of C5-T1 (C5, C6, C7, C8 and T1), *************these origins form the roots of the Brachial plexus.*************

- **********Roots**********
    
    The roots are formed by the ventral rami of C5-T1. They are located within the prevertebral musculature, between the middle and anterior scalene muscles to be exact.
    
    Branches of the root - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Dorsal scapular nerve\|Dorsal scapular nerve]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Long thoracic nerve\|Long thoracic nerve]] 
    
- **********Trunks**********
    
    ***********************************The roots converge to form trunks.*********************************** The trunks are located within the posterior triangle of the neck, an anatomical position with its base at the clavicle, is anterior border marked by the sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. and the posterior border marked by the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Trapezius\|Trapezius]].
    
    There are three trunks of the brachial plexus:
    
    - Superior trunk - formed by the convergence of the roots of C5-C6.
    - Middle trunk - a continuation of the root of C7.
    - Inferior trunk - formed by the converge of the roots of C8 and T1.
    
    The only branches from the trunk arises from the superior trunk (C5-C6), as it is the convergence of the roots of C5 and C6. There are 2 branches arising from the trunk:
    
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Suprascapular nerve\|Suprascapular nerve]]
    - [[Subclavian nerve (Nerve to [[subclavius)\|Subclavian nerve (Nerve to [[subclavius)]]]]
- ******************Divisions******************
    
    All three trunks divide into the anterior and posterior divisions, i.e. 6 divisions arise from the 3 trunks. These divisions sit behind the clavicle.
    
    Note that the anterior divisions of all 3 trunks supply the anterior flexor compartments of the arm (and the forearm?), while the posterior divisions of all 3 trunks supply the posterior extensor compartment. ******************This is self-explanatory, as [[the posterior divisions converge to form the posterior cord, which sits in a posterior position in the upper limb.\|the posterior divisions converge to form the posterior cord, which sits in a posterior position in the upper limb.]]*
    
- **********Cords**********
    
    ****************************************************************************************************The 6 divisions from the three trunks converge in the 3 cords at the upper half of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axilla\|Axilla]]:*
    
    - The anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunk converge to give the lateral cord ([[The lateral cord of the brachial plexus gives off 3 branches\|The lateral cord of the brachial plexus gives off 3 branches]]).
    - The anterior division of the inferior trunk continues to give the medial cord ([[The medial cord of the brachial plexus gives off 5 branches\|The medial cord of the brachial plexus gives off 5 branches]]).
    - The posterior divisions of all the trunks converge to give the posterior cord ([[The posterior cord of the brachial plexus gives off 5 branches\|The posterior cord of the brachial plexus gives off 5 branches]]).

**********Branches**********

Branches of the brachial plexus can be present at the roots, cords and at the terminal branches.
