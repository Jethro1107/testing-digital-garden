# IAS03: Molecular Biology and its relevance to Medicine 1

Created: January 10, 2022 8:22 PM
Updated: June 18, 2022 11:20 AM

## Learning Outcomes

To illustrate how problems in transcription and translation can lead to disease through specific examples

Use Nature Education as a Resource for Extended reading

## Examples for Clinical Relevance

- Sickle cell disease
- Thalassaemia
- Cystic fibrosis

## Molecular Biology and Sickle Cell Disease

- Symptoms of Sickle Cell Disease

- Sickle Cell Disease - An classic in the link of DNA sequence to protein function to cell function

    Haemoglobin is a tetramer (4 subunits), 2 of them alpha subunits, and 2 of them beta subunits
    
    Alpha protein subunit HBA2 is coded by *HBA1* and  *HBA2* genes
    
    Beta protein subunit HBB1 is coded by HBB gene
    
    Haemoglobin abbreviations - Hb, Hgb, HbA
    
    Proteins do not have a fixed structure, when something binds to it, there is a conformational change of the protein, explaining the cooporativity in the binding of oxygen

    Glutamic acid consist of the carboxyl group (proton donor), thus negatively charged and hydrophilic, thus tends to point outwards
    
    Valine is a hydrophobic amino acid, thus tends to point inwards
    
    ![[B4321F5C-3307-419D-95AE-962A35DE158D.jpeg\|B4321F5C-3307-419D-95AE-962A35DE158D.jpeg]]
    
    Valine is hydrophobic, and doesn't like to face the outside environment, and thus stick with one another, as hydrophobic molecules tend to stick with one another, and since it is an alpha2beta2 structure, it allows them to stick to each other repeatedly, forming strands and eventually fiber

- Persistence of sickle cell disease

    Most people in Africa are Heterozygous for sickle cell disease, can still carry oxygen normally, but have reduced risk of severe malaria, higher chance of survival
    
    Homozygous of HBB normal (no mutation), are counter selected by malaria
    

## Molecular Biology and Thalassaemia

- Thalassaemia general information

4 functional alpha genes - normal

3 functional alpha genes - still normal, 'silent' alpha-thalassaemia

2 functional alpha genes - problematic, thalassemia trait, maybe anaemic?

0 functional alpha genes - fatal in utero

- Genetic Origin of Thalassaemia

    CFTR involved in transport chloride across membranes
    
    75% or CF patients gave this mutation on both genes - autosomal ressesive
