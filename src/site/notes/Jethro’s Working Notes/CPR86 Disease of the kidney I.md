# Principles of renal diseases and Clinical Manifestation of renal diseases

### **Classification of renal disease**

Renal diseases are classified into those that affect the four major morphological component of our kidney: glomeruli, tubules, interstitium and the blood vessels

Hence, renal diseases can be classified into:

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Glomerular Disease\|Glomerular Disease]]
- Tubulointerstitial diseases
- Vascular diseases

### Diagnosis of renal diseases

Can be diagnosed via clinical diagnosis, pathological diagnosis or on both the clinical and pathological basis

### **Common clinical manifestation of renal diseases**

- Nephrotic syndrome
    - **Clinical presentation of nephrotic syndrome**
        
        Massive proteinuria - ≥ 3.5g per day
        
        Hypoalbuminemia
        
        Generalized oedema - due to hypoalbuminemia, thus results in reduced capillary oncotic pressure, thus resulting in increased fluid flux and oedema
        
        Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) - a maladaptation of the body to maintain osmolality
        
    - **Which group of disease entities is nephrotic syndrome associated with?**
        
        Associated with glomerular disease:
        
        Membrane nephropathy
        
        Minimal change disease
        
        Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
        
        Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
        
        Amyloidosis
        
    - **Complications of nephrotic syndrome**
        
        Hypercoagulability - risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism
        
        Hyperlipidemia and lipiduria
        
        Decreased serum binding proteins - raise plasma drug levels e.g. warfarin
        
        Increased risk of infection - due to loss of immunoglobin, complements and impaired neutrophil phagocytic functions
        
        Progressive renal failure
        
- Nephritic syndrome
    - **Clinical presentation of nephritic syndrome**
        
        Acute onset of gross haematuria (visible red blood cells in urine) or microscopic haematuria (red cell casts in urine on microscopy)
        
        Subnephrotic proteinuria
        
        Deminished glomerular filtration rate/ GFR - manifested as oliguria, azotemia
        
        Hypertension - as a result of fluid retention
        
    - **Which group of disease entities is nephritic syndrome associated with?**
        
        Associated with glomerular disease:
        
        Post infectious glomerulonephritis
        
- Acute kidney injury (AKI)
    - **Clinical presentation of acute kidney injury**
        
        Defined as the rapid reduction of glomerular filtration rate in hours to days
        
        The abrupt onset of renal dysfunction is reflected by an acute onset in serum creatinine and urea and is associated with oliguria or anuria in severe forms of acute kidney injury
        
    - **Which group of disease entities is acute kidney injury associated with?**
        
        Associated with glomerular, tubular, interstitial and vascular diseases
        
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
    - **Clinical presentation/definition of chronic kidney disease**
        
        Also known as chronic renal failure
        
        Defined as the persistent decline of GFR (≤ 60 ml/min/1.73m2) for 3 months
        
    - **Which group of disease entities is chronic kidney injury associated with?**
        
        Associated with glomerular, tubular, interstitial and vascular diseases
        
- End stage renal disease (ESRD)
    - **Definition of end stage renal disease**
        
        ESRD is the final and irreversible stage of renal dysfunction defined as when GFR is less than 5% of normal
        
    - **Treatment of end stage renal disease?**
        
        Renal replacement therapy - dialysis and kidney transplant

### **What is azotemia and uraemia?**

Azotemia - the biochemical abnormalities (i.e. elevated blood urea nitrogen/ BUN and serum creatinine) that is largely related to the a decrease in GFR

Uraemia - When azotemia manifests as clinical signs and symptoms, it is called uraemia

Cf: [[ Azotemia  is a biochemical abnormality that refers to an elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and is related largely to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Azotemia is a consequence of many renal disorders, but it also arises from extrarenal disorders. It is a typical feature of both acute and chronic kidney injury.  Prerenal azotemia  is encountered when there is hypoperfusion of the kidneys that impairs renal function in the absence of parenchymal damage. It may be caused by hypotension, excessive fluid losses from any cause, or if the effective intravascular volume is decreased due to shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis of the liver.  Postrenal azotemia  is seen whenever urine flow is obstructed distal to the kidney. Relief of the obstruction is followed by correction of the azotemia.\| Azotemia  is a biochemical abnormality that refers to an elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and is related largely to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
