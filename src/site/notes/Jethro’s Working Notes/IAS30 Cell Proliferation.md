### Regulation of Cell Divisions - Whole Body Perspective

- What are the changes in cell number and complexity during development?
    
    Increase in cell number and complexity
    
    By active proliferation and differentiation of cells
    
- What happens to the developmental potential and ability to proliferate of cells during development?
    
    Decrease in potency of cells and ability to proliferate as they differentiate
    
    Totipotent → Pluripotent → Multipotent → Limited potential
    
    Proliferative → Non-proliferative
    
- Do cells proliferate in adult state?
    
    Yes, turnover of cells is replaced by differentiated progeny of proliferative stem cells
    
    Allowing continuous regeneration of cells, with no net increase in cell number
    
- Describe the process of continuous regeneration in the crypt (below the villi)
    
    Multipotent adult stem cells at the base of the crypt divides mitotically to give two daughter cells, one daughter cell renews as stem cells, while the other becomes the precursor cell
    
    The precursor cell divides and is pushed up along the crypt to the villus and eventually becomes a terminally differentiated cell
    
- Compare the potency of adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells
    
    Potency of embryonic stem cells (pluripotent) is much greater than adult stem cells (multipotent)
    
    Embryonic stem cells in the inner cell mass can differentiate into different lineages of cells
    
    Adult stem cells can only differentiate into limited cell types
    

### Regulation of Cell Division - Single Cell Cycle

- What are the different phases in a cell cycle? How are these phases catagorised?
    
    G1 (Gap) → S (Synthesis) → G2 (Gap) → M (Mitosis) → G1 (Gap)
    
    Division comprised of M phase
    
    Interphase comprised of G1, S G2 phase
    
- What are the different cell cycle checkpoints?
    
    G1 checkpoint before entry into S phase - Is environment favourable, Is cell size large enough, Is there DNA damage
    
    G2 checkpoint before entry into M phase - Is cell large enough, Is all DNA replicated, Is there DNA damage
    
    M checkpoint - Are chromosomes properly attached to mitotic spindles
    
- What functions do cell cycle checkpoints serve?
    
    To stop cell cycle upon sensing unfavorable signals, e.g. intrinsic and extrinsic factors
    
- What are Cyclin-Cdk complexes?
    
    Cdk - Cyclin-dependent kinase, the catalytic subunit that cyclically activate to phosphorylate different target proteins, at serine/threonine residue
    
    Cyclin - regulatory subunit of the complex, produced in a periodic manner
    
- How is S phase entry regulated by Cyclin-Cdks?
    
    Regulated by Cyclin D - Cdk4/6
    
    Cyclin D - Cdk 4/6 phosphorylate Retinoblastoma (RB) protein, releasing and activating RB bound E2F to turn on genes for DNA synthesis (Enzymes for DNA synthesis)
    
    ESF also results in synthesis of Cyclin E, which combines with Cdk2 to give Cyclin E - Cdk2 complex, further phosphorylation of RB
    
    This further activates E2F as transcription factors for gene involved in DNA synthesis
    
    A positive feedback loop is established
    

### Regulation of Cell Divisions - Regulation of cyclin-dependent of protein kinases

- How is Cdk activities regulated?
    
    Periodic synthesis (regulated transcription) and degradation (regulated proteolysis) of cyclins
    
    Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by other kinases and phosphatases e.g. explosive activation of Cyclin B-Cdk1
    
    By Cdk inhibitors CIP/KIP and INK4 proteins that mediate the DNA checkpoint control
    
- How is M phase entry regulated by Cyclin-Cdk?
    
    Explosive activation of Cyclin B-Cdk1 
    
    M-Cdk is inactive
    
    It is phosphorylated twice by inhibitory kinase and activating kinase, such that it is still inactive
    
    The inhibitory phosphate is removed by activating phosphatase Cdc25, thus activating M-Cdk
    
    Activated M-Cdk phosphorylates inactive Cdc25 phosphatase, which can activate M-Cdk explosively
    
    This positive feedback loop accounts for the explosive activation of Cyclin B-Cdk1
    
- What are the two types of Cdk inhibitors?
    
    INK4 protein - Inhibit Cdk4 and other G1 phase inhibitors
    
    CIP/KIP - Cdk-interacting protein / Kinase inhibitory protein, they are universal Cdk inhibitors
    
- How does DNA damage-induced p21 synthesis lead to inhibition of Cyclin-Cdk Activities?
    
    DNA damage results in activation of kinases that phosphorylate p53 transcription factor, stabilising and activating it
    
    p53 is a transcription factor for p21 CIP gene
    
    p21 is synthesized to inhibit cyclin-Cdk activities
    
- How can mutations of cell cycle regulators in cancer cells result in cancer cells?
