    - Health promotion - A process that enables indiviudals to gain control over their lives and to improve their health
    - 3 aims of health promotion:
        - Informed choice - increase knowledge and awareness
        - Empowerment - encourage individuals to take actions to improve their health
        - Creating opportunities - ensure the circumstances for individuals to make health choices is always an easy choice
    - Approaches to health promotion:
        - Medical approach - identify high risk individuals
        - Behavorial change approach - aims to encourage individuals to make behavoriar changes and take action to improve their health (Behavorial change may be guided by state of change model or health belief model (illness cognition and behavior))
        - Education approach (informed choice)
        - Empowerment approach
        - Social change approach

- [[Factors affecting health behavior\|Factors affecting health behavior]]
    
    
    | Cognitive factors | Societal factors |
    | --- | --- |
    | Vulnerability (to a disease) | Social norms |
    | Cue to action | Situational barriers (consider ecological model of health and disease) |
    | Pros and cons of health behavior |  |
    | Health motivation |  |
    | Perception of control (external or internal) |  |
    | Self efficacy |  |

- Transtheorectical model of behavorial change
    - Changes does not occur in an instant, rather it involves many steps
    - There are 5 states of change as described by the TTM of behavorial change
        - Pre-contemplation - not intending to make changes
            - Aim:
                - Increase awareness for the need of change (any concerns of current behavior)
                - Envision possibility of change
        - Contemplation - considering a change
            - Aim:
                - Analyze the pros and cons of the current behavorial patterns (hopefully they see that the cons outweigh the pros)
        - Preperation - preparation of changes, or making small changes
            - Aim:
                - Increase commitment
                - Create an actionable plan
        - Action - actively engaging in a new behavior
            - Aim:
                - Implementing strategies for change
                - Sustain commitment to change in face of difficulty
        - Maintainence - sustaining the change over time
            - Aims
                - Sustaining change over time and in different situations
                - Avoid relapse to old behavior

[[Jethro’s Working Notes/Illness cognition and behavior\|Illness cognition and behavior]] 

- May concern the difference between [[disease and illness\|disease and illness]]

- Illness cognition
    - Illness cognition is the common sense belief of their own illness
    - There are 5 components of illness cognition
        - Identity of disease (name, and associated symptoms)
        - Perceived cause of disease (may draw on multiple causal models)
        - Timeline of disease (acute vs chronic) ([[The general public has a poor concept of chronic diseases\|The general public has a poor concept of chronic diseases]])
        - Consequences of disease on their life
        - Curability or controllability (curable? controlled by who? Internal or external locus of control)

- Illness behavior
    - What is illness behavior?
        - Illness behavior is the action taken in response to signs and symptoms of an illness.
        - Health seeking behavior is a form of illness behavior
    - Leventhal's self-regulatory model of illness behavior illustrates the relationship in which illness perception may affect illness behavior
        - In the self-regulatory model of illness behavior, an assumption is made: When facing a problem, an individual will be motivate to solve the problem and re-establish a sense of normalcy
        - There are three steps to the self-regulatory model of illness behavior, triggered by a situation stimuli (e.g symptoms of illness)
            - Interpretation (making sense of a problem, or establishing [[illness cognition\|illness cognition]], or an emotional response to the illness)
            - Coping (Approach coping or avoidance coping)
            - Appraisal of the coping strategy
    - A type of illness behavior is help-seeking behavior
        - Whether an individual is going to engage in help-seeking behavior is largely dependent on two factors: Illness recognition (associated with the identity of disease) and illness danger.
