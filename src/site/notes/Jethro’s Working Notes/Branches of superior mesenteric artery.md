### Branches of superior mesenteric artery

The superior mesenteric artery is an anterior [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Major branches of abdominal aorta\|Major branches of abdominal aorta]], at (L ). It gives off several branches that supply the small intestines ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the small intestine\|Anatomy of the small intestine]]) and parts of the large intestine ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the large intestine\|Anatomy of the large intestine]]).

    **Intestinal arteries** (15-18 jejunal and ileal arteries) - *passes through the mesentery of the small intestine*, and develop collateral blood supply by forming arterial arcades, with straight arteries vasa recta, supplying the gut wall.
    
    ********************************************Middle colic artery******************************************** - Ascends retroperitoneally and ****************************************passes through the transverse mesocolon**************************************** to supply the proximal 2/3 of the transverse colon.
    
    ************************************Right colic artery************************************ - Passes to the right retroperitoneally to supply the ascending colon.
    
    ********************************Ileocolic artery******************************** - The terminal branch of superior mesenteric artery. Descends to the right of the root of mesentery, where it branches into the colic branch and ileal branch.
    
    - The Colic branch supplies the ascending colon and the cecum.
    - The Ileal branch supplies the terminal ileum, and gives rise to the appendicular artery, which passes through the mesoappendix to supply the appendix.
