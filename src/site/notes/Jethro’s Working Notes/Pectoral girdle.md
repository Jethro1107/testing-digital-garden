### Pectoral girdle
The pectoral girdle consist of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clavicle\|Clavicle]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Scapulae\|Scapulae]] (joined at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Acromioclavicular joint\|Acromioclavicular joint]]). It forms part of the bony framework of the shoulder ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Regions of the upper limb\|Regions of the upper limb]]).

#### Movement of the pectoral girdle
The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Acromioclavicular joint\|Acromioclavicular joint]] holds the clavicle and scapulae together, such that the clavicle and the scapulae move as a unit.
- Elevation and depression
- Protraction and retraction - During protraction, the medial borders of the scapulae move apart. During retraction, medial borders of the scapulae move together.
- Scapulae rotation (Upward rotation and downward rotation)
