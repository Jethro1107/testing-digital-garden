# Anatomy of the Abdominal Wall

### What is the abdominal wall?

The abdominal wall is a multi-layered ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Layers of the abdominal wall\|Layers of the abdominal wall]] ), musculo-aponeurotic* framework of the trunk, superiorly bordered by the bony framework of the inferior aspect of the thorax (costal margin), posteriorly bordered with the lumbar region of the vertebral column and inferiorly bordered by the upper aspect of the pelvis.

*Aponeurosis are a thin sheath of connective tissues that connects muscles to bones. It is similar to a tendon (when the connection is concerned), but differs as it is not rope-like as a tendon.

The abdominal wall can be separated into the *1) [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterolateral abdominal wall\|Anterolateral abdominal wall]]* and *2) [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior abdominal wall\|Posterior abdominal wall]]* .

This is how you should review the abdominal wall:

- Understand the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Layers of the abdominal wall\|Layers of the abdominal wall]]
- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterolateral abdominal wall\|Anterolateral abdominal wall]]
    - List and denote the features of its muscles ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Flat muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall\|Flat muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall]], [[Vertical muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall\|Vertical muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall]])
    - Describe the origins of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rectus sheath\|Rectus sheath]] and its associations with the [[rectus abdominis\|rectus abdominis]]
    - Describe the [[  Arterial supply and venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall  \|  Arterial supply and venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall  ]]
    - Describe the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall\|Innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall]]
    - Describe the [[Lymphatic Drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall\|Lymphatic Drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall]]
- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior abdominal wall\|Posterior abdominal wall]]
