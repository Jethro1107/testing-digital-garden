### Shock

- **Definition of shock**
    
    Shock is a state of circulatory failure in which diminished cardiac output or reduced effective circulating blood volume causes generalised hypoperfusion of tissues and leads to cellular hypoxia
    
    - **Outcome and reversibility of shock**
        
        At onset, reversible cell injury occurs
        
        Prolonged shock causes irreversible cell injury and can be fatal
        
    
    Cf: [[Robbins  Shock\|Robbins  Shock]] 
    
- **Types of shock**
    - Hypovolemic shock
        - **What is hypovolemic shock?**
            
            Hypovolemic shock results from low cardiac output due to insufficient effective circulating blood volume
            
        - **Cause of hypovolemic shock**
            
            It is caused by:
            
            Hemorrhage - external (chop wound, hematemesis, melena), internal (Hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, ruptured ectopic pregnancy etc.)
            
            Fluid loss - Dehydration, excessive loss (vomiting, diarrhea, burns)
            
        - **Stages of hypovolemic shock**
            1. Asymptomatic stage ( <10% loss)
            2. Compensated shock (10-25% loss)
                
                Results in compensated hypotension, in which the loss of blood volume causes a drop in cardiac output, but maintains blood pressure via compensatory mechanisms
                
                - Compensated hypotension
                    - **Compensatory mechanisms activated during compensatory shock**
                        
                        Loss of blood volume results in activated baroreceptor reflex, vasopressin release, activation of RAAS and generalised sympathetic stimulation
                        
                        Baroreceptors reflex causes tachycardia
                        
                        Sympathetic stimulation results in the release of catecholamines, resulting in peripheral vasoconstriction, increased total peripheral resistance and maintained blood pressure
                        
                        Renal vascular constriction activates RAAS thus increases
                        
                        Vasopressin release and RAAS activation results in fluid retention in the kidneys to restore blood volume
                        
                        Vasopressin and angiotensin also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, causing increased total peripheral resistance and maintained blood pressure
                        
                        Impaired renal perfusion and perfusion to other organs, and peripheral vasoconstriction with every efforts to maintain perfusion to the brain and the heart
                        
                        ![[/CBB3835A-2F1C-455B-8D8D-5BF0DC08C65F.png\|/CBB3835A-2F1C-455B-8D8D-5BF0DC08C65F.png]]
                        
            3. Progressive shock 
                
                Results when no therapeutic intervention is provided for the early stage, and autoregulation breaks down
                
                - **How does compensated shock precipitate into progressive shock?**
                    
                    Involves breakdown of autoregulation
                    
                    Continuous hypoperfusion of the kidneys and other vital organs causes irreversible injury to the organs
                    
                    Necrotic cells release vasodilators, causing vasodilation and increased exudation, thus causing further decrease in circulating volume
                    
                    This eventually results in multi-organ breakdown and death
                    
            4. Irreversible shock
                
                Irreversible hypoxic injury to vital organs
                
            
            Cf: [[Guyton and Hall  Shock caused by hypovolemia - Hemorrhagic shock\|Guyton and Hall  Shock caused by hypovolemia - Hemorrhagic shock]] 
            
    - Anaphylactic shock
        - **Cause of anaphylactic shock**
            
            Involves exposure to an allergen, resulting in a systemic type I hypersensitivity reaction
            
        - **Pathogenesis of anaphylactic shock**
            
            Involves a sensitization phase and activation phase
            
            In the activation phase, histamine, prostaglandin and complement activation results in vasodilation
            
            This results in blood pooling and blood extravastation, thus causing reduced circulating blood volume 
            
            Cf: [[Anaphylaxis\|Anaphylaxis]], [[  Effects of mast cell activation  \|  Effects of mast cell activation  ]], [[  Process of sensitization to allergen  \|  Process of sensitization to allergen  ]] 
            
    - Septic shock
        - **Cause of septic shock and risk factors**
            
            Caused by gram-negative endotoxin producing bacteria and gram-positive bacteria
            
            Predisposing factors include:
            
            Debilitating disease
            
            Complications of instrumentation and treatment
            
            Burns
            
            Anything that comprimised immunity, especially during hospitalization (septic shock is the second most frequent cause of shock related death in hospitals)
            
        - **Pathogenesis of septic shock**
            
            Inflammatory reactions - vasodilation mediated by histamine and complements
            
            Endothelial activation and damage - due to endotoxins
            
            Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Common clinical conditions associated with septic shock**
            1. Peritonitis
                
                From genital tract
                
                From ruptured guts

            3. Gangrenous infections
            4. Bacteremia from urinary tract infection (E. coli)
    - Cardiogenic shock
        - **What is cardiogenic shock?**
            
            Cardiogenic shock results from low cardiac output as a result of myocardial pump failure
            
        - **Causes of cardiogenic shock**
            1. Acute MI
            2. Ventricular arrhythmia
            3. External compression (cardiac tampaonade)
                
                Caused by ventricular rupture, ruptured dissecting aorta aneurysm, penetrating injury to the heart
                
            4. Outflow obstruction (pulmonary embolism)

### Heart Failure

- **Definition of congestive heart failure**
    
    Heart failure, or congestive heart failure is defined as the condition in which the heart cannot pump blood to adequately meet the metabolic demands of peripheral tissues, or can only do so only at elevated filling pressures.
    
- Compensation to heart failure
    
    Cf: [[Guyton and Hall  Circulatory Dynamics in Cardiac Failure\|Guyton and Hall  Circulatory Dynamics in Cardiac Failure]] 
    
- **Classification of heart failure by side**
    
    Heart failure can be divided into left heart failure and right failure
    
    Note that the classification is artificial, as failure of one side often puts excessive strain on the other, terminating in global heart failure
    
    - Left heart failure
        - **Cause of left heart failure**
            
            IHD
            
            Hypertension
            
            Aortic and mitral valvular disease
            
            Primary myocardial disease
            
        - **Clinical presentation of left heart failure**
            
            Dyspnea - due to pulmonary edema
            
            Orthopnea - dyspnea that occurs in supine position and is relieved by changing to a sitting or standing position
            
            Cough - due to pulmonary edema and fluid transudation into alveoli
            
            On physical examination:
            
            Bibasilar rales/crackles - due to pulmonary edema
            
            Tachycardia - due to increased sympathetic stimulation
            
            Shift of apex beat - due to cardiomegaly
            
    - Right heart failure
        - **Most common cause of right heart failure**
            
            Left heart failure
            
        - **Clinical presentation of right heart failure**
            
            Peripheral oedema - due to venous congestion
            
            Hepatomegaly/ Hepatic congestion
            
            Elevated JVP
            
- **How does the heart fail?**
    
    Less able to pump:
    
    Myocardial infarction, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy
    
    Pump is less coordinated:
    
    Valvular disease, arrhythmia
    
    Physically prevented from pumping:
    
    External compression force - tension pneumothorax, compressed bodies in accidents (e.g. stampede, falling buildings)
    
    Cardiac tamponade - ventricular rupture, ruptured dissecting aortic aneurysm, stab wound to heart
    
- Ejection fraction
    - **What is ejection fraction? What is ‘normal’ and ‘reduced’?**
        
        Ejection fraction refers to the fraction of blood in the left ventricle which is pumped out with each ejection
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Normal ejection fraction is 55-70%
        
        Reduced ejection fraction is <40%
