### Big data in healthcare

Big data is the use of data ***********************************************************************************************************at high volume, which moves at high velocity, with many sources and highly variable in structure and nature***********************************************************************************************************. It is the cornerstone to [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Precision Medicine\|Precision Medicine]].

### Ethical concerns of big data in healthcare and its ethical concerns

Using [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Principlism\|Principlism]], we can identify certain ethical concerns of big data in healthcare:

- ****************Autonomy****************
    
    ******************************Informed consent in big data research******************************
    
    It is difficult to obtain informed consent for big data research. Some research use opt-out systems, that assume consent from participants.
    
    Broad consent is used in biobanking.
    
    ******Confidentiality******
    
- ******************************Non-maleficence******************************
    
    **************Continuous monitoring and privacy**************
    
    Continuous monitoring may promote better self management, but have privacy implications.
    
    ****************************************Extragenous findings****************************************
    
    Extragenous findings with data use
    
    ************************************************************Data security and exploitation************************************************************
    
    Data collected is susceptible to leaks by hacks, cyber attacks and covert data sales, which have privacy implications.
    
    These data leaks may affect insurability and employability.
    
- **************Justice**************
    
    Big data may result in widening of health divide both globally and locally:
    
    - From a global perspective: it may result in health inequalities within and between countries.
    - Locally: It might not be the best use of funding and resources.
