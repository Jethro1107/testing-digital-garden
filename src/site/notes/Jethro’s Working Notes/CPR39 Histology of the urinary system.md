### Organization of the urinary system

- **Main function of the urinary system**
    
    The urinary system is involved in production and elimination of urine, allowing for water, electrolyte, and acid-base homeostasis
    
    Ref: [[Junqueira’s Histology  Function of the urinary system\|Junqueira’s Histology  Function of the urinary system]] 
    
- **Gross anatomy and main functions of the urinary system structures**
    
    The urinary system consist of paired kidneys and ureters, a urinary bladder and urethra
    
    - **Anatomical structures/Gross anatomy of the kidneys**
        
        Kidney (a bean shaped organ with a hollow renal sinus medially) consist of an outer cortex and an inner medulla
        
        Renal cortex - consist of renal corpusules of the nephron
        
        Renal medulla - consist of renal tubules
        
        Extensions of renal cortex into inner aspect of kidney, the renal columns separates the medulla into renal pyramids
        
        Each renal pyramid and its cortical tissue at its base and sides (renal columns) constitute a renal lobe
        
        The apical tip of renal pyramids, the renal papilla consist of openings of collecting ducts that drain into the minor calyx
        
        In the renal sinus, several minor calices unite to form a major calyx, where 2 or 3 major calices unite to form the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped superior end of ureter, connecting with ureter at ureteropelvic junction

    Kidneys - Responsible for filtering blood and controlling its composition and urine production, and also hormone production (renin, erythropoietin, calcitriol)
    
    Ref: [[Function of the kidneys\|Function of the kidneys]]
    
    Ureters - Responsible for transport of urine from kidneys to urinary bladder
    
    Urinary bladder - Responsible for storing and voiding urine
    
    Urethra - Responsible for transport of urine from urinary bladder to the external environment
    

### Functional histology of the kidneys

- Microanatomy of the kidneys
    
    
    - **Microanatomy of a renal corpuscle**
        
        Renal corpuscle consist of a glomerulus and the bowman’s capsule
        
    - **Microanatomy of a nephron**
        
        A nephron consist of a bowman’s capsule, which extends into the proximal convulated tubule in the cortex, then the Loop of Henle into the medulla and distal convoluted tubules back into the cortex
        
        Bowman’s capsule - A blind-ended dilated portion of the kidney tubule
        
        Proximal convulated tubule - Continuous from the Bowman’s capsule and located primarily in the cortex
        
        Loop of Henle - Consist of a thin descending limb that descends into the medulla, and a thick ascending limb that ascends into the cortex
        
        Distal convoluted tubule - continuous with junctional tubules and collecting tubules

    - **2 types of nephrons**
        
        Cortical nephron (80-85%) - primarily located in the cortex, with a short loop of Henle
        
        Juxtamedullary nephron (15-20%) - renal corpuscle close to the medulla, but remains in cortex, with a long loop of Henle

    - **Microanatomy of a urineferous tubule**
        
        Urineferous tubules involve all kidney tubules from Bowman’s capsule to collecting tubules
        
        Bowman’s capsule → Proximal convoluted tubule → Loop of Henle → Distal convoluted tubule → Junctional tubule → Collecting tubule
        
        Note that collecting tubule converge into a collecting duct courses down the renal pyramid towards the renal papilla to drain urine into minor calyces
        
    - **Number of urineferous tubules in each adult kidney**
        
        around 1 million
        
- Functional histology of uriniferous tubules
    - **Epithelium of the urineferous tubules and cell types**
        
        Urineferous tubules is lined with simple epithelium, but with different cell types in different parts of the tubules due to different functions
        
    - **Adaptive features of epithelium of urineferous tubules to protect kidney interstitum from urine**
        
        The urine becomes hyperosmotic and is dangerous for the kidney interstitium, thus complete separation of lumenal side and kidney interstitium, achieved by:
        
        Tight junctions between epithelial cells
        
        Progressively thicker basement membrane
        
    - Renal corpuscles
        - **Location of renal corpuscle in kidneys**
            
            The renal corpuscle can only be found in the cortex of the kidneys
            
        - **Function of renal corpuscle**
            
            Responsible for blood filtration
            
        - **Structures making of renal corpuscle**
            - Glomerulus
                
                
                - **What is the glomerulus?**
                    
                    A tuft (20-40 loops) of fenestrated capillaries surrounded by a double-layed epithelial Bowman’s capsule 
                    
                - **Blood flow to and from glomerulus**
                    
                    Blood flows from afferent arteriole to efferent arteriole 
                    
                    Blood pressure of afferent arteriole is greater than that of efferent arteriole to increase blood pressure in glomerulus for ultrafiltration to take place
                    
            - Bowman’s capsule
                
                
                - **What is the bowman’s capsule?**
                    
                    Blind-ended dilated portion of the kidney tubule enclosing the bowman’s/urinary/capsular space
                    
                
                - **2 layers of bowman’s capsule**
                    - Parietal layer - outer layer lining outer surface of the Bowman’s capsule
                        - **Epithelial lining of the parietal layer**
                            
                            The parietal layer is lined with simple squamous epithelium supported by an external basement membrane
                            
                            At the tubular pole of the renal corpuscle, the epithelium changes to the simple cuboidal epithelium characteristic of the proximal convoluted tubule

                            Cell body of podocytes give rise to several projections, which give rise to smaller branches called pedicles
                            
                            The cell body do not contact the basement membrane of the capillary, but each pedicle is in direct contact with the basement membrane
                            
                            Pedicles of a podocyte interdigitate with pedicles from other podocytes

        Each kidney receives blood from a renal artery, which branch into two or more segmental artery at the hilum
        
        At the renal sinus, the segmental artery branches into interlobar arteries extending between renal pyramids towards the corticomedullary junction
        
        Interlobar arteries at corticomedullary junction branch into arcuate artery which travel in an arc along this junction at the base of renal pyramids
        
        Smaller interlobular arteries branch off at right angles from arcuate arteries and enter the cortex
        
        Interlobular arteries give rise to afferent arterioles, which supply blood to the glomerulus, which is drained by efferent arterioles
        
        Efferent arterioles branch again to give peritubular capillaries to supply covoluted tubules in cortical nephrons, and into vasa recta in juxtaglomerular nephrons
        
        Peritubular capillaries drain into interlobular veins, which then drains into arcuate veins, whereas vasa recta can drain directly into arcuate veins or into interlobular veins
        
        Arcuate veins drain into interlobar veins, then into segmental veins and into the renal veins

            - **What are extraglomerular mesangial cells and their function?**
                
                They are modified fibroblas/mesangial cells
                
                They provide support, and are interconnected with macula densa cells and JG cells with gap junctions, allowing passage of signals from macula densa cells to JG cells, releasing Ca2+ in order to decrease GFR ([[CPR41  Proximal and distal tubular transport\|CPR41  Proximal and distal tubular transport]])

### Functional histology of the ureters

- Excretory pathway
    - **Epithelial lining of excretory pathway**
        
        Excretory pathway is lined with transitional epithelium (uroepithelium), except for the distal part of urethra
        
        The transitional epithelium is stratified, with around 3-6 layers of cells
        
        When contracted, the cells assume a more columnar shape, when distended, the cells assume a squamous shape
        
        ![[/CPR39_Histology of the urinary system.png\|/CPR39_Histology of the urinary system.png]]
        
    - **Cell types of the epithelial lining**
        
        Basal cells - multipotent stem cells sitting on the basement membrane
        
        Intermediate cells - several layers, where cells are columnar at base and cuboidal at surface
        
        Umbrella cells - highly differentiated, large, dome-shaped, multinucleated cells to protect underlying cells from cytotoxicity of hyperosmotic urine
        
        - **Specialization of umbrella cells**
            
            Extensive junctional complex complex at apical surface (tightest epithelium in the body), prevents leakage of urine into underlying tissue, protecting underlying tissue from hyperosmotic effects

- Ureter
    - **Microstructure of ureter**
        
        Mucosa - innermost layer:
        
        Uroepithelium - lines lumen
        
        Lamina propria - Dense collagenous and elastic connective tissue
        
        Muscularis - middle layer:
        
        Inner longitudinal layer of smooth muscles
        
        Outer circular layer of smooth muscles
        
        (Outermost longitudinal layer in distal third ureter)
        
        Adventitia - outmermost layer of loose connective tissue with autonomic nerve plexus, blood vessels and lymphatics
        
    - **Mechanism to maintain urine flow to urinary bladder**
        
        By peristaltic waves of contraction by the muscularis layer of ureters
        

### Functional histology of the urinary bladder

- **Microstructure of urinary bladder wall**
    
    Mucosa - lined with transitional epithelium (uroepithelium) and lamina propria (dense connective tissue)
    
    Thick layer of muscularis:
    
    Smooth muscles arranged longitudinally, circularly and transversely, forming detrussor muscles
    
    Inferiorly, detrussor muscles forms sphincter vesicae
    
    Adventitia/serosa (superior surface of bladder)
    

### Functional histology of the urethra

- Male urethra
    - **Function of male urethra**
        
        15-20cm (highly variable) for conducting urine and semen to the external environment
        
        Offers protection from abraision, caustic chemicals, water loss and infection
        
    - **4 segments of male urethra and its epithelial lining**
        
        Intramural urethra - lined with uroepithelium
        
        Prostatic urethra - upper prostatic urethra is lined with uroepithelium, lower prostatic urethra transitions into a stratified or pseudostratified columnar epithelium
        
        Membranous urethra - lined with stratified or pseudostratified columnar epithelium
        
        Spongy/penile urethra (longest) - lined with stratified columnar or pseudostratified epithelium proximally, and a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium distally
        
- Female urethra
    - **Length of female urethra**
        
        Relatively short, 4cm long
        
    - **Transition of epithelial lining in female urethra**
        
        From transitional epithelium to stratified columnar or pseudostratified epithelium, to non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium when proceeding distally
