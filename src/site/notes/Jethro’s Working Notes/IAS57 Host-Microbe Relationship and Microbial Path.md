### Stages of Infection

- What are the five stages of infection. Illustrate the stages with a diagram.
    
    Incubation period - The time interval between exposure and appearance of symptoms
    
    Prodromal period - The period when nonspecific symptoms occur, not all infection have a prodromal period
    
    Specific illness period - The period when characteristic signs and symptoms of an infectious disease occur
    
    Decline period - The period when symptoms are resolving as immunity comes in
    
    Convalescence - The period when the patient has recovered from the illness, with no signs and symptoms, but some organisms can cause latent infection or the infection may become chronic after recovery
    
- What are the features of the stages of infection in dengue fever?
    
    Lack of prodromal period
    
    Characteristic symptoms like rash immediately start patient becomes vireamic
    
- What are the features of the stages of infection in measles?
    
    Presence of prodromal periods - Nonspecific symptoms like fever and respiratory tract symptoms occur
    
    Specific Illness period - Marked by the appearance of a characteristic rash
    
- Are incubation periods uniform in all diseases?
    
    No, incubation periods range from a few hours to months
    
- What are the factors affecting incubation period?
    
    Microbial inoculum (dose)
    
    Route of inoculation
    
    Rate of replication of the microbe
    
    Host succeptibility
    
    Host immune response - For immunocomprimised patients, microbe replication is uncontrolled, thus generally a shorter incubation period
    
- What is a latent infection? Give examples of latent infection.
    
    Latent infection - The phase during the course of an infection during which the pathogen is dormant or inactive in different cells and tissues (not detectable). Overt disease is not produced, but the microbe is not eradicated.
    
    Examples:
    
    Herpesviridae
    
    Mycobacterium tuberculosis
    
- Draw a diagram illustrating the stages of infection of an acute viral infection followed by latent infection and periodic reactivation. Why does reactivation of virus occur?
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 3.13.48 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 3.13.48 PM.png]]
    
    Viral levels is 0 during latent infection as the virus remains dormant in different cells and tissue
    
    Reactivation of virus occurs as immune system decline, giving the virus an opportunity to cause disease
    
- Draw a diagram illustrating acute viral infection followed by chronic infection.
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 3.15.32 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 3.15.32 PM.png]]
    
    The microbe persists in the patient, causing slow damage of tissues
    
- Draw a diagram of chronic infection leading to subacute sclerosing panecephalitis by persistent measles virus infection.
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 3.16.27 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 3.16.27 PM.png]]
    
    After measles infection, the virus moves to the brain and replicates slowly, causing chronic infection.
    
- What happens to TB infection in an immunocompetent adult?
    
    After recovery, most (90%) infected individuals have latent infection. The bacteria remains dormant in the tissues, but never manifest into disease. Yet they have a lifetime risk of reactivation
    
    In 5-10% of patients, reactivation of TB bacteria occurs when the immune system is weakened.
    

### Host-Microbe Interactions

- How are microbes classified by their virulence?
    
    Pathogen (virulent) - Disease causing microbes
    
    Non-pathogen/Commensals (non-virulent) - Non-disease causing microbes
    
- How are hosts classified?
    
    Normal host - Intact innate and adaptive immune defenses
    
    Abnormal host - Abnormal innate and/or adaptive immune defenses
    
- From the above classification, describe 4 types of host-microbe interactions and the outcomes.
    
    Pathogen + Normal host ⇒ Infection
    
    Non-pathogen + Normal host ⇒ No infection
    
    Pathogen + Abnormal host ⇒ Infection
    
    Non-pathogen + Abnormal host ⇒ Infection
    
- How does probability of disease manifestation and severity of disease depend on the microbe and host?
    
    It depends on the balance between ability of the pathogen to invade, and the ability of the host to defend
    
- What are syndromes?
    
    Syndromes refer to a specific group of signs and symptoms that correlate with each other
    
    Some infections are subclinical and do not manifest into disease syndromes
    
    The same syndrome may be caused by a variety of microbe
    
    The same microbe may produce a variety of disease syndrome in different individuals
    
- How do is the ability of host to defend classified?
    
    Innate immunity and Adaptive (Acquired) immunity
    
    Innate is further classified into
    
- What are examples of infections due to changes in specific host defects? (BAD Q)
    
    Innate:
    
    Mechanical Barriers - Catheter, mucositis, burns and surgery compromise integrity of the barriers, causing invasion of normal flora
    
    Cell-mediated immunity (Polymorphs, macrophages) - Neutropenia, Chronic Granulomatous Disease increase risk of Pyogenic infections and Fungal infections
    
    Adaptive:
    
    Complement, Antibody - Congenital deficiencies may weaken adaptive immune system
    
    Cell-mediated immunity (T-lymphocytes) - HIV may compromise T lymphocytes
    
- Define virulence or pathogenicity.
    
    Virulence/Pathogenicity - The degree or ability of a pathogen to cause disease
    
- What are the characteristics of a virulent microbe?
    
    Low infective dose
    
    High attack rate (Most infected people develop disease)
    
    No. and potency of virulence factors
    
    High morbidity & mortality
    
- What are virulence factors?
    
    Virulence - Microbial factors that enhance the organism's ability to colonize, invade and multiply inside the host (攻) or evade the host's defense mechanisms (守）
    
- Give examples of virulence factors.
    
    Offensive VF - Adherence, Invasion, Toxins
    
    Defensive VF - Antiphagocytosis, antiproteolysis, complement protease
    
    Non-specific virulence factors - iron update system
    
- What are the 6 basic steps of pathogenesis of an infection?
    
    Encounter, entry, spread, multiplication, damage, outcome
    
    Damage can be caused by tissue destruction from the agent, and from host response
    

### Chain of Infection

- Describe the chain of infection.
    
    Reservoir ⇒ Portal of exit ⇒ Transmission ⇒ Portal of entry ⇒ Host outcome
    
- What is the natural reservoir of infectious agents?
    
    Natural reservoir is the natural habitat where the infectious agent lives, grows and multiplies
    
    There can be endogenous and exogenous reservoirs
    
    Endogenous reservoirs (inside hosts) - natural flora
    
    Exogenous reservoirs (outside hosts) - Humans, Animals, Environment
    
- What is the portal of exit? Give examples.
    
    Portal of exit - The path by which the pathogen leaves the reservoir/host into a suceptible host, usually referring to where the pathogen usually localize
    
    Examples:
    
    Respiratory viruses exit from the respiratory tract
    
    Pathogens in animals may exit through animals themselves, excreta or food items
    
    Pathogens may exit through arthropods via bites
    
    Pathogens may exit through donated organs (rare due to screening)
    
- What are different mode of transmissions.
    
    Inhalation (Direct or indirect), Contact (direct or indirect), ingestion, Insect/arthropod bites, Wounds, Iatrogenic (Transplantation or transfusion)
    
- What are different portals of entry.
    
    Contact, ingestion, inhalation, insect bites, Iatrogenic
    
- Does infection always have to manifest at the portal of entry?
    
    No
    
    Enteroviruses for example can enter circulation and cause viraemia, and enter target tissues and cause infections at a different site
    
- What are the factors affecting host outcomes?
    
    Host-Microbe interaction
    
    Microbe dosage
    
    Mode of inoculation
    
    Availability and timeliness of medical treatment
