### Fidaxomicin

Fidaxomicin is a first in class macrocyclic antibiotic. It has a narrow spectrum, only active against gram positive bacteria. It is bactericidal.

- **MOA of fidaxomicin**
    
    Fidaxomicin binds to the DNA-RNA polymerase complex, inhibiting the initial separation of DNA strands during transcription.
    
    This inhibits mRNA synthesis.

- **Pharmacokinetics of fidaxomicin**
    
    It is minimally absorbed, and is excreted almost entirely throughout the faeces.
    
    This is actually a good thing, as drugs can concentrate within the colon during the treatment of C. difficile colitis.
    
- **Usage of fidaxomicin**
    
    It is especially useful in the treatment of [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Clostridium difficile colitis\|Clostridium difficile colitis]].
    
- **Adverse effects of fidaxomicin**
    1. GI disturbance - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea
    2. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, anaemia and neutropenia is rare.
- **Mechanism of fidaxomicin resistance**
    
    Resistance can develop with the modification of RNA polymerase binding site. However, fidaxomicin resistance is rare.
