A class of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB)\|Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB)]].

- **Example of depolarising NMB**
    Suxamethonium
- **********************************************MOA of depolarising NMB**********************************************
    Chemically, suxamethonium consist of 2 acetylcholine (ACh) covalently linked together.
    
    It binds to nicotinic ACh receptor at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, triggering depolarization, and clinically, fasciculation, a phase of contraction before the onset of relaxation.
    
    Presistent depolarization results in inactivation of the voltage-gated Na+ channels, thus preventing propagation of action potentials, resulting in muscle relaxation.
- **Pharmacokinetics of depolarising NMB**
    Suxamethonium has a rapid onset of action (30-45s), with around 15s of fasciculation followed by relaxation.
    
    It has a short duration of action, lasting for roughly 8-12 minutes.
    
    It has poor bioavailability, with roughly 10% only reaching the NMJ, as it is hydrolysed by plasma pseudocholinesterase.
    
    Its action terminates when it undergoes dissociation and diffuses away the NMJ.
- **Clinical use of depolarising NMB**
    Due to its rapid onset and short duration of action, it is commonly used for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rapid sequence induction\|Rapid sequence induction]].
- **Adverse effects of depolarising NMB**
    - **Bradycardia**
        This is due to the muscarinic effects on SA node, and affects neonates especially.
        Bradycardic effects can be avoided by use of atropine (competitive antagonist).
    - **Hyperkalaemia**
        As activation of AChR triggers release of small efflux of K+ ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction\|Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction]]).
    - **Increased intracranial pressure, intraoccular pressure, intragastric pressure**
        This is due to increased muscle contraction.
    - **Myalgia, masseter spasm**
    - **Anaphylaxis**
    - **Malignant hyperthermia**
        This is an inherited autosomal dominant condition, where depolarising NMB can trigger a hypermetabolic state, with hyperthermia, muscle rigidity and increased ETCO2 (end tidal CO2).
