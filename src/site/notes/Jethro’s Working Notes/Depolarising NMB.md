### Depolarising NMB

A class of [[Neuromuscular blocking agents [[(NMB)\|Neuromuscular blocking agents [[(NMB)]]]].

- ******************************************************Example of Depolarising NMB******************************************************
    
    Suxamethonium
    
- **********************************************MOA of depolarising NMB**********************************************
    
    Chemically, suxamethonium consist of 2 acetylcholine (ACh) covalently linked together.
    
    It binds to nicotinic ACh receptor at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, triggering depolarization, and clinically, fasciculation, a phase of contraction before the onset of relaxation.
    
    Presistent depolarization results in inactivation of the voltage-gated Na+ channels, thus preventing propagation of action potentials, resulting in muscle relaxation.
    
- ******************************************************************************Pharmacokinetics of depolarising NMB******************************************************************************
    
    Suxamethonium has a rapid onset of action (30-45s), with around 15s of fasciculation followed by relaxation.
    
    It has a short duration of action, lasting for roughly 8-12 minutes.
    
    It has poor bioavailability, with roughly 10% only reaching the NMJ, as it is hydrolysed by plasma pseudocholinesterase.
    
    Its action terminates when it undergoes dissociation and diffuses away the NMJ.
    
- ****************************************************************Clinical use of depolarising NMB****************************************************************
    
    Due to its rapid onset and short duration of action, it is commonly used for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rapid sequence induction\|Rapid sequence induction]].
    
- **********************************************************************Adverse effects of depolarising NMB**********************************************************************
    - **Bradycardia**
        
        This is due to the muscarinic effects on SA node, and affects neonates especially.
        
        Bradycardic effects can be avoided by use of atropine (competitive antagonist).
        
    - **Hyperkalaemia**
        
        As activation of AChR triggers release of small efflux of K+ ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction\|Neurotransmission across a neuromuscular junction]]).
        
    - **Increased intracranial pressure, intraoccular pressure, intragastric pressure**
        
        This is due to increased muscle contraction.
        
    - **Myalgia, masseter spasm**
    - **Anaphylaxis**
    - **Malignant hyperthermia**
        
        This is an inherited autosomal dominant condition, where depolarising NMB can trigger a hypermetabolic state, with hyperthermia, muscle rigidity and increased ETCO2 (end tidal CO2).
