### Gain of function mutations in FGFR3 underlie Achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia and Thanatophoric dysplasia

Gain-of-function mutations in FGFR3 results in increased activity of FGFR3 as a tyrosine kinase.

This results in increased phosphorylation of STAT-1 into phospho-STAT-1.

Phospho-STAT-1 results in expression of p21, that inhibits Cdk-2/3 complexes.

This inhibits cell cycle progression from GI to S, and hence inhibits chondrocyte proliferation in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Epiphyseal plate\|Epiphyseal plate]].

This retards bone growth via endochondral ossification, resulting in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Dwarfism\|Dwarfism]].

- **********************These gain-in-function mutations may be due to:**********************
    - A mutation in the transmembrane domain that stabilizes the dimer (ligand-dependent activation of FGFR)
    - A mutation that results in dimerization of FGFR via disulphide bridges (ligand-independent activation of FGFR)
    - A mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain, such that it remains active without undergoing dimerization (ligand independent activation of FGFR)
