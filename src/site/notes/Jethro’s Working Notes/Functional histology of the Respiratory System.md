### Introduction: Functions of the Respiratory System

- What are the main functions of the respiratory system?
    1. **Gas Exchange**
        
        Bilateral diffusion of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) across the respiratory membrane
        
        Occurs in the exchange portion of the respiratory system - Respiratory bronchioles to alveoli
        
    2. **Air supply**
        
        Supply air to the delicate respiratory membrane (gas exchange site)
        
        Condition the air by filtering, warming and humidifying the air
        
        Occurs in the conducting portion of the respiratory system - Nasal cavities to terminal bronchioles
        
    3. **Pulmonary ventilation**
        
        Respiratory movements responsible for air movements into and out of the gas exchange sites
        
        Provided by the ventilating portion of the respiratory system - thoracic wall, diaphragm and pleura
        
- What are the secondary functions of the respiratory system?
    1. **Phonation**
        
        Process of sound production by vocal cords due to movement of air
        
    2. **Olfaction**
        
        The act of smelling allowed by the olfactory epithelium
        
    3. **Regulation of acid-base balance**
        
        Due to the exchange of CO2, keeping proper balance of acid and bases in the extracellular fluid
        
- How is the respiratory system functionally divided?
    
    The respiratory system is functionally divided into the **exchanging portion, the conducting portion and the ventilating portion**
    
    **Exchanging portion** (site of gas exchange) - Respiratory bronchioles to alveoli
    
    **Conducting portion** (respiratory tract/airway) - [[Nasal cavities to bronchial tree in lungs\|Nasal cavities to bronchial tree in lungs]]
    
    **Ventilating portion** - Thoracic wall, pleura, diaphragm
    

### Exchanging Portion of the Respiratory System

- What is the main function of the exchanging portion of the respiratory system?
    
    The main function of the exchanging portion is for **gas exchange**, the bilateral diffusion of gases between the air in alveoli and the blood in capillaries, across the air blood barrier that is the respiratory membrane
    
- Describe the microstructure of the exchanging portion of the respiratory system.
    
    **Respiratory Bronchioles**
    
    Each **terminal bronchiole** subdivides into two or more **respiratory bronchioles**, which serve as a region of transition between the conducting and exchanging portion of the respiratory system
    
    Structurally, the respiratory bronchiolar mucosa is identical to that of the terminal bronchioles, except that their walls consist of evaginating pouches known as alveoli, where gas exchange occurs
    
    Histologically, the respiratory bronchioles is also lined with ciliated cuboidal epithelial cells and Clara cells, but at the rim of the alveolar opening, the respiratory bronchiolar epithelium becomes continuous with the squamous alveolar cells (Type I pneumocytes)
    
    [[(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 386-387)\|(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 386-387)]]
    
    **Alveolar duct**
    
    The **respiratory bronchioles** further branches into **alveolar ducts**, which is completely lined with the opening of alveoli
    
    [[(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 388-389)\|(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 388-389)]]
    
    **Alveolar sacs**
    
    **Alveolar sacs** refer to the group of alveoli at the end of the alveolar ducts
    
- What are the cells present in an alveolus?
    
    Type 1 pneumocytes
    
    Type 2 pneumocytes
    
    Alveolar dust cells/Alveolar macrophages
    
- What is the histological features of a type I pneumocyte?
    
    A simple squamous epithelial cell
    
    Quite flat, with a buldging nucleus
    
- What is the histological features of a type II pneumocyte?
    
    More cuboidal cells
    
    Cytoplasms consist of distinctive multilamellar bodies (MB)
    
    MB - A protein, carbohydrate phospholipid complex expelled from type II pneumocytes to form surfactant
    
- What is the function of surfactant?
    
    To **reduce surface tension** in the alveoli and has some **bactericidal effects**
    
- What are alveolar macrophages? What are their functions?
    
    Also called dust cells, they are macrophages in alveolar septum and alveoli derived from circulating monocytes
    
    Function:
    
    Protect the alveolar space by scavenging the surface
    
    Phagocytose dust and other foreign particles that has entered alveolar space during inspiration
    
    After phagocytosis, they move up the bronchial tree, where they are carried by cilia and are eventually swallowed or coughed out with mucus
    
- What is the alveolar septum? What cells and fibres does it contain?
    
    A connective tissue between alveoli
    
    Cells - Endothelial cells of blood vessels, interstitial cells, smooth muscle cells, immune cells
    
    Fibres - Type 1 collagen, elastic fibres
    
- What is the respiratory membrane?
    
    The air-blood barrier - Consisting of a type I pneumocyte, an endothelial cells of the blood capillary and a fused basal laminae
    
- What are heart failure cells?
    
    In patients with left heart failure or chronic pulmonary edema, their lungs are congested with extravasated blood
    
    The high pulmonary blood pressure causes rupturing in endothelial cells and type I pneumocytes, allowing **erythrocytes to pass into the alveoli**
    
    Alveolar macrophages phagocytose the erythrocytes
    
    **These alveolar macrophages are now called heart failure cells, which are present in lungs and sputum**
    
    [[(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 392)\|(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 392)]]
    

### Conducting Portion of the Respiratory System

- What is the main function of the conducting portion of the respiratory system?
    
    To provide a **conduit** through which air moves to and from the gas exchange site
    
    To **condition air** for contact with delicate respiratory membrane, by filtering, warming and moistening incoming air
    
- Briefly list the gross structures of the conducting portion of the respiratory system. Describe how the respiratory tract is separated into the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract.
    - 2 Nasal Cavities and the paranasal sinuses
    - Pharynx (Nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx)
    - Larynx
    - Trachea
    - Bronchial Tree
    
    The respiratory tract is separated into the **upper respiratory tract** and the **lower respiratory tract** at the laryngeal inlet
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 9.38.42 AM.png\|/Screenshot 2022-01-06 at 9.38.42 AM.png]]
    
- Describe the structure of the nasal cavity and their correlating functions.
    
    **The two nasal cavities are covered by mucous membrane**
    
    The left and right nasal cavity each has two components - The **external vestibule** and the **internal nasal cavities (or fossae)**
    
    The **vestibule** is the most anterior part of the nasal cavity, and consist of **vibrissae (hair)** to filter out lager particulate matter present in the inspired air
    
    Within the **vestibule**, the epithelium loses itâ€™s keratinised layer and undergoes a transition into typical respiratory epithelium before entering the nasal fossae
    
    The **nasal septum** separates the left and right nasal cavity
    
    The **superior, middle and inferior conchae** are extension of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity
    
    The **middle and inferior conchae** are lined with respiratory epithelium, while the **superior conchae** are lined with olfactory epithelium
    
    The **nasal septum** and the **conchae** increase the surface area for conditioning incoming air
    
    Below each conchae, are the corresponding **meatus**, which are narrow passage to **increase turbulence of airflow**, which further increase contact of air with the mucous membrane to condition the air
    
    [[(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 377)\|(Junqueira's Basic Histology - Text and Atlas 12th Ed,2010 p. 377)]]
    
- Describe the structure of the mucous membrane and its function in preparation of incoming air.
    
    The **mucous membrane** consist of the **mucosa** and the **submucosa**
    
    The **mucosa** consist of the **respiratory epithelium** and the **lamina propria**
    
    The respiratory epithelium consist of **goblet cells** that secret mucus to trap debris in air
    
    The **submucosal glands** also secret mucus that line the respiratory epithelium and trap debris in air
    
    The **cilia** on the surface of the respiratory epithelium sweep the mucus towards the pharynx where it could be swallowed and neutralised by stomach acid, thus filtering incoming air
    
    The **submucosa** has rich vascular supply for exchanging heat between blood and incoming air, thus warming incoming air
    
    Evaporation of water from mucus humidifies incoming air
    
    Glands in the submucosa also secret mucus and water secretions to coat and moisten the respiratory epithelium
    
    Lymphoid elements are found in the lamina propria to eliminate foreign antigens
    
- How does nasal conchae affect air flow?
    
    Nasal conchae creates **turbulent air flow**, thus increasing the likelihood that incoming air will come in contact with mucous membrane
    
- What is epistaxis? Why does it occur?
    
    Epistaxis refers to nosebleed
    
    It occurs as the nasal cavity has a rich vascular supply with plexuses in the submucosa
    
- What are the four paranasal air sinuses?
    
    The four paranasal air sinuses have openings into the nasal cavity
    
    Frontal sinuses, ethmoid cells, sphenoid sinus, maxillary sinus
    
    ![[/image.png\|/image.png]]
    
- Describe the lining of the the paranasal air sinuses. What functions do they serve?
    
    It is also lined with mucosal membrane, which is also continuous with the lining of the nasal cavity
    
    Hence, they are also involved in conditioning air by filtering, warming and moistening of air
    
- What is the pharynx? How is it separated?
    
    The pharynx is the common chamber for the digestive and respiratory system, separated into three parts, the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and the laryngopharynx
    
    Posterior to the nasal cavity, the nasopharynx is the first part of the pharynx
    
    Proceeding caudally, is the oropharynx, which is posterior to the oropharynx
    
    The last part of the pharynx is the laryngopharynx, which is posterior to the larynx
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
- What is the larynx?
    
    The larynx is a rigid, short passage for air between the pharynx and the trachea
    
- Describe the structures in the larynx.
    
    The **laryngeal wall** is supported by the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage
    
    The lumen of the larynx is separated into three cavities: **the vestibule, the ventricle and the infraglottic cavity**
    
    The **epiglottis** is present on the upper rim of the larynx
    
    Beneath the laryngeal vestibule, the lateral walls bulge to form a pair of **vestibular folds or false vocal cords**, and below another pair of lateral folds known as the [[  true vocal cords  \|  true vocal cords  ]]
    
    The space between the false vocal cord and the true vocal cord is **the ventricle**
    
    The space between the two true vocal cords form **the glottis** 
    
- Describe how laryngitis results in hoarse sounds.
    
    Normally, vocal folds open and close smoothly, forming sounds as air passes by them, causing them to vibrate
    
    During laryngitis, the vocal folds become inflamed and they swell, resulting the creation of hoarse sound
    
    Inflammation often caused by viral infection or vocal strain and are not serious
    
- Describe the process of the cough reflex.
    
    Cough reflex is initiated by particulate matter or irritants in the conducting portion of the respiratory system
    
    It begins with a large volume of air being inhaled, causing the closing of the glottis and the epiglottis, followed by a powerful contraction of the muscles of expiration and then an immediate opening of the glottis and epiglottis
    
    The last event permits a powerful rush of air to force the irritant out of the respiratory passage
    
- What is the trachea?
    
    Trachea is a short passage of air between the larynx and the main bronchi, **surrounded by 15-20 C-shaped pieces of hyaline cartilages**
    
    The **open ends of the cartilage** are on the posterior surface, which are bridged by an elastic ligamentous membrane with smooth muscles (trachealis muscles)
    
    The entire organ is surrounded by **adventitia** [[(surrounding the cartilages)\|(surrounding the cartilages)]]
    
- What is the carina?
    
    The carina is the **tracheal bifurcation** (the branching of the trachea into the two main bronchi)
    
    It located at the **sternal angle**
    
    The carina is extremely sensitive to mechanical stimulation as everything that moves down the respiratory tract will hit the carina
    
- Describe the structure of the respiratory epithelium.
    
    The respiratory epithelium consist of a **ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with goblet cells**
    
- What are the 3 cell types present on the respiratory epithelium?
    
    **Ciliated columnar cells** - predominate in the respiratory tract, with around 300 motile cilia on its apical surfaces
    
    **Mucous goblet cells** - Secrets mucus that lines the respiratory epithelium to trap and remove bacteria and other particulate matter from inspired air
    
    **Basal cells** - Small round cells that lie on the basal lamina but do not reach the lumen, are stem cells that give rise to other cell types
    
- Describe the branching of the bronchial tree in lungs.
    
    Trachea â†’ Primary/Main bronchi â†’ Secondary/Lobar Bronchi â†’ Tertiary/Segmental bronchi â†’ 16-20 geerations of branching â†’ Bronchioles â†’ Terminal bronchioles
    
    The trachea branches into **two primary bronchi** that enter each lung at the hilum, along with the vascular and lymphatic structures
    
    After entering each lung the primary bronchi course anteroinferiorly, where it branches into the secondary bronchi
    
    - In the **right lung**, the primary bronchi branches into three secondary bronchi, supplying the superior, middle and inferior lobe
    - In the **left lung**, the primary bronchi branches into two secondary bronchi, supplying the superior and inferior lobe
    
    The secondary bronchi then divide into **tertiary bronchi**, which give rise to smaller and smaller bronchi, whose terminal branches are bronchioles (less than 1mm in diameter)
    
    **Bronchioles** further divide into five to seven terminal bronchioles
    
- Describe the structural similarities and difference between larger bronchi and smaller bronchi.
    
    The mucosa of the primary bronchi is similar to that of the tracheal mucosa, except for the arrangement of cartilage and smooth muscles
    
    Instead of having C-shaped cartilages, the primary bronchi consist of a **circular ring of cartilage encircling the lumen**, and smooth muscle also surround the primary bronchi
    
    As bronchial diameter decrease, the **cartilage rings is replaced by isolated plates of hyaline cartilages**, but retain a similar ring of smooth muscles
    
    [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Functional histology of the Respiratory System/Histological slides of bronchi\|Histological slides of bronchi]]
    
- Describe the structural differences between bronchi and bronchioles.
    
    Tertiary bronchi further branch into smaller and smaller branches, 15-20 generations of branching result in bronchioles (<5mm in diameter)
    
    Bronchioles lack cartilages and glands in their mucosa
    
    In **larger bronchioles**, the epithelium is still ciliated pseudostratified columnar, but the epithelial height and complexity decreases to become ciliated simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium in **terminal bronchioles** (loss of pseudostratification) 
    
    In this transition, globlet cells are lost, but are replaced by another exocrine cell, called the **Clara cells**
    
- What are C cells? What are their functions?
    
    C cells are known as Clara cells or Club cells
    
    They are **non-ciliated, columnar cells with a dome shaped apical surface, which consist of many secretory vesicles**
    
    Functions of C cells:
    
    - Secretion of surfactant lipoprotein which reduce surface tension and prevent the collapse of bronchioles
    - Secretion of mucin
    - Detoxification of inhaled xenobiotic compounds by P450 enzyme system on smooth ER
    - Secretion of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines for local immune defense
- Discuss the pathophysiology of asthma.
    
    Caused by chronic inflammation of the bronchial tree, characterised by **bronchospasm**, the sudden constriction of the smooth muscles in the bronchioles, causing difficulty of breathing
    
    Bronchospasm (asthmatic attacks) is triggered by **mast cell degranulation** by the presence of specific antigens
    
    Epinephrine and other sympathetic drugs relax the muscles to increase bronchiole diameter as a treatment for asthmatic attacks
    

### Ventilating Portion of the Respiratory System

- What is ventilation?
    
    Ventilation refers to the mechanisms of creating pressure differences to trigger air movements into (inspiration) and out of (expiration) the lungs
    
    It involves the thoracic cage, the diaphragm, abdominal muscles and lung elastic connective tissues
    
    Inspiration is active and involves muscle contractions
    
    Expiration is passive and involves relaxation of muscles and retraction of elastic fibres, thus allowing contraction of lungs
    
- Describe the histology of pleural cavities.
    
    The pleura consist of a thin squamous mesothelium attached to the surface of thoracic wall or lungs via connective tissue
    
    Bordered by mesothelial cells, the pleural cavity lies between the visceral and parietal pleura
    
    Within the pleural cavity is a thin film of pleural fluid, which reduces the friction between the two pleural layers during respiratory movement
    
- Discuss pleural effusion, itâ€™s pathology and its effects on breathing.
    
    Pleural effusion refers to the pathological change in the pleural cavity in which it contains liquid or air
    
    It may be caused by inflammation of the pleura, a condition called pleuritis or pleurisy, caused commonly by an acute viral infection or pneumonia
    
    It results in shortness of breath
    
- Discuss the histology of the olfactory epithelium.
    
    The olfactory epithelium is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium comprised of three types of cells
    
    **Basal cells** - Small round cells that lie on the basal lamina but do not reach the lumen, are stem cells that give rise to other cell types
    
    **Sustentacular cells** - Columnar cells with microvilli on their apical surfaces
    
    **Olfactory neurons** - Bipolar neurons in which the dendritic ends of the neurons consist of chemoreceptors that respond to odoriferous substances by generation an action potential along the axons of the neurons
    
    Olfactory neurons are protected by sustentacular cells, and are distinguished by position of nuclei
    
- Describe the histology of the vestibular folds and true vocal cords and their relations to phonation.
    
    Vestibular folds - Lined with respiratory epithelium, consist of glands whose dicts open into the ventricles
    
    True vocal cord - Lined with stratified squamous epithelium, consist of vocalis ligament and vocalis muscles running front to back
    
    Air forced through larynx by ventilating mechanism vibrates the true cord, allowing phonation
