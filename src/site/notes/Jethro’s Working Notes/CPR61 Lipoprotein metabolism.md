### Lipoprotein metabolism

- General structure of lipoproteins
    - **What are lipoproteins?**
        
        Lipoprotein - A spherical transport vehicle for lipids to travel in aqueous circulation
        
    - **General structure of lipoproteins**
        
        Outer shell of lipoprotein consist of:
        
        1. Phospholipid monolayer with nonesterified cholesterol 
        2. Apolipoprotein for lipoprotein recognition
        
        Inner core of lipoprotein carries different lipids:
        
        Triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl ester
        
    - **Types of lipoproteins**
        
        Chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL)
        
        They vary by size and density, lipid/protein composition, and site of origin
        
- Functions of apolipoproteins and their associations with different lipoproteins
- Lipoprotein metabolism
    - **Exogenous pathway of lipoprotein metabolism**
        
        Dietary lipids are packaged into chylomicrons
        
        Nascent chylomicrons packaged in the intestine consisting of ApoB48 are rich in in TAG and low cholesterol, and is released from epithelial cells by exocytosis
        
        Chylomicrons are returned into circulation via the thoracic duct, which drains into the subclavian vein
        
        Once entering plasma, Apo CII and ApoE are transferred from HDL into chylomicrons, where ApoCII is for activation of Lipoprotein C lipase (LPL), and ApoE is used for recognition by hepatic receptors

        In periphheral tissues, lipoprotein C lipase on capillary endothelial cell is activated by ApoCII on chylomicrons, which hydrolyze TAG in chylomicrons into fatty acids and glycerol, where FA is uptake by peripheral tissue, mainly adipocytes for accumulation of TAG, and glycerol is transported to liver

        90% of TAG in chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by LPL, causing decrease in size and increase in density as it remodels into chylomicron remnants
        
        ApoCII is returned to HDL when it is remodelled into chylomicron remnants
        
        In the liver, ApoE on chylomicron remnants activates ApoE receptors on hepatocytes, resulting in ApoE receptor-mediated endocytosis of chylomicron remnants
        
        Endosome fuses with lysosome and is hydrolysed, releasing amino acids, cholesterol and FFA
        
        ApoE receptor is recycled

    - **Endogenous pathway of lipoprotein metabolism**
        
        Endogenously produced lipids in liver are packaged into nascent VLDL and released into blood
        
        Nascent VLDL packaged in liver consist of ApoB100, are rich in TAG and low in cholesterol
        
        Once entering plasma, ApoCII and ApoE is transferred from HDL to VLDL, where ApoCII is for activation of Lipoprotein C lipase (LPL), and ApoE is used for recognition by hepatic receptors
        
        In periphheral tissues, lipoprotein C lipase on capillary endothelial cell is activated by ApoCII on VLDL, which hydrolyze TAG in chylomicrons into fatty acids and glycerol, where FA is uptake by peripheral tissue, mainly adipocytes for accumulation of TAG, and glycerol is transported to liver

        Most of TAG in VLDL is hydrolysed, causing a decrease in size and increase in density, such that it remodels into IDL
        
        ApoCII and ApoE are returned to HDL, while ApoB100 is retained, such that it remodels into LDL
        
        ApoB100 bind to LDL receptors on hepatic and extrahepatic tissues, resulting in LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL

            Consist of ApoA, ApoC, Apo E
            
        - **Function of high density lipoprotein (HDL)**
            1. As circulating reservoir for ApoCII and ApoE
            2. Uptake free cholesterol from peripheral cell membrane and convert them to cholesterol ester by LCAT (licithin cholesteryl acyltransferase) reaction
            3. Exchange lipids with other lipoprotein by CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) mediate transfer, which transfers TAG from VLDL into HDL, and transfers cholesteryl ester from HDL to VLDL

- Composition of lipoproteins (including size and density)
    - **Composition of chylomicrons**
        
        High in TAG, low in cholesterol

    - **Composition of LDL**
        
        Lower TAG and more cholesterol than VLDL

    - **Effects of meals on blood samples and its implication**
        
        Diet can affect postprandial plasma lipoprotein composition:
        
        Low lipid diet (rice and beans) - serum remains clear
        
        High lipid diet (fats and oils) - serum becomes turbid

        Hence, in lipid analysis must be carried out when fasting to minimize variation in lipids
        
    - **Effects of plasma elevated chylomicrons, LDL and VLDL on serum appearance**
        
        Chylomicron - creamy layer at the top

        VLDL - turbid appearance

    - **Lipoprotein migration in gel eletrophoresis**
        
        Separates lipoprotein by size and charge
        
        Smaller lipoproteins move faster
        
        Distance travelled: chylomicrons (none when fasting) < LDL < VLDL < HDL
        
        VLDL travel faster than LDL despite larger size due to the negatively charged Apolipoproteins
