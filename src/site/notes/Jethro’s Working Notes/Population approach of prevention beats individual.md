### Population approach of prevention beats individual approach of prevention

Individual approach of prevention involves actions or interventions applied to at risk individuals or groups.

Population approach of prevention involves shifting the curve of exposure towards a favourable direction.

It makes sense that population approach of prevention beats individual approach of prevention because it reduces exposure to certain risk factors at a community level.

- ****Population approach of prevention is limited by the prevention paradox****
    
    Individuals may perceive little benefit of the intervention, even though the intervention may benefit the entire population.
