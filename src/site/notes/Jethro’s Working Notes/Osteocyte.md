### Osteocyte

When [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoblast\|Osteoblast]]s are trapped in the organic matrix they synthesize, they become osteocytes.

- **Location of osteocytes**
    
    Osteocytes are found within lacunae surrounded by the bone matrix, where they maintain the surrounding bone matrix. Osteocytes also produce cytosolic processes that come in contact with each other, forming cannaliculi in the bone matrix that enables communication and nutrition chain of up to 10 osteocytes. i.e. Osteocytes and their processes are located in cavities of the bone matrix, lacunae and the cannaliculi radiating from it.

Osteocytes are incapable of division, but enjoy a half-life of 25 years, where they maintain the surrounding bone matrix: Death of osteocytes means subsequent resorption of surrounding bone matrix.
