        They are often polar, thus are repelled by the non-polar region of the phospholipid bilayers
        
    - What transporters are used to transport glucose from intestinal lumen into enterocytes?
        
        SGLT1 (active transport) - Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1 co-transports glucose and galactose with Na+ down the Na+ gradient generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase Pump
        
        GLUT5 (facilitated transport) - Glucose Transporter 5 transports fructose from the lumen into the cytosol
        
    - What transporters are used to transport monosaccharides out the enterocytes at the basolateral side?

        Galactose convert into glucose and stored as glycogen in liver
        
        Fructose most convert to glucose, glycogen and lactate in liver. Some may be oxidized or converted to fatty acids. Only small amount of fructose in bloodstream
