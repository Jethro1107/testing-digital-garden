        - What are the two types of glucose and how do they differ?
            
            Alpha and beta glucose differ from the orientation of OH group in C1, affecting angles of bonds, 3D structure and whether they are recognized by enzymes

        Disaccharides such as lactose and sucrose is not cleaved during the process
        
    - Does digestion occur in the stomach?
        
        No, low pH in the stomach stops the action of alpha-amylase

    - Describe the digestive process near intestinal villi
        
        Mucosal cell membrane bounded enzymes and small intestinal disaccharidase converts dietary disaccharides and products of starch digestion into monosaccharides
        
        - Where are such enzymes found?
            
            On the membrane of brush borders of enterocytes
            
- Uptake of monosaccharides by enterocytes
    - Why are transporters used for the uptake of monosaccharides into enterocytes?
        
        They are often polar, thus are repelled by the non-polar region of the phospholipid bilayers
        
    - What transporters are used to transport glucose from intestinal lumen into enterocytes?
        
        SGLT1 (active transport) - Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1 co-transports glucose and galactose with Na+ down the Na+ gradient generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase Pump
        
        GLUT5 (facilitated transport) - Glucose Transporter 5 transports fructose from the lumen into the cytosol
        
    - What transporters are used to transport monosaccharides out the enterocytes at the basolateral side?
        
        GLUT2 - Glucose Transporter 2 transports glucose, fructose and galactose out the enterocytes on the basolateral side
        
        GLUT5- Glucose Transporter 5 transports fructose out the enterocytes on the basolateral side
        
- Cellular Uptake of Glucose

    - How do different cells take up glucose?
        - Liver
            
            Via GLUT2, a bidirectional glucose transporter
            
            A hub for endogenous glucose production to supply glucose to the blood via gluconeogenesis

        Galactose convert into glucose and stored as glycogen in liver
        
        Fructose most convert to glucose, glycogen and lactate in liver. Some may be oxidized or converted to fatty acids. Only small amount of fructose in bloodstream
