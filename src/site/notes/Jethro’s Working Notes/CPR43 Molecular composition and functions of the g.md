### Podocytes

- **Molecular composition of slit diaphragm between podocyte foot processes**
    
    Nephrin
    
    - **Structure of nephrin relating to its function**
        
        The carboxyl terminal of nephrins is located i the intracellular domain, where as amino terminal is located in the extracellular domain
        
        It pocesses immunoglobin loops that are maintained by cysteine-cystein disulfide bridges
        
        If cysteine of immunoglobin does not form a disulphide prdige, a spacer domain is formed
        
        Ig loops associatee with each other, and are impermeable to large molecules, whereas spacer domain allows larger molecules to pass through
        
        Nephrin interacts with intracellular partners (probably contractile proteins), to change size of spacer domains, thus regulating filtration

### Glomerular basement membrane

- Components of the glomerular basement membrane
    - Type IV collagen
        - **Intracellular biosynthesis of procollagen triple helix**
            
            Translation of mRNA results in formation of pre-procollagen
            
            Cleavage of signal peptides to form procollagen alpha chains
            
            Modification of procollagen by hydroxylation and glycosylation
            
            Association of C-terminal propeptide, stabilized with disulphide pridges to form a procollagen triple helix

            C-terminal dimerization
            
            N-terminal tetramer formation
            
            Lateral association of triple helical domain to form a collagenous suprastructure

    - Laminin
        - **Structure of laminin molecule**
            
            Contains A, B1 and B2 chains, joined to form a 4-armed structure
            
            Nidogen - associates laminin with other partners

        - **Assembly of laminin into ultrastructure**
            
            A, B1 and B2 chains associate with each other, leaving the free end to associate with respective partners

    - Proteoglycans
        - **Core proteins of glomerular basement membrane proteoglycans**
            
            Agrin and perlecan

        - **Glycosaminoglycan of proteoglycans in glomerular basement membrane**
            
            Heparan sulfate - made of glucuronic acid and N-acetylgycosamine as disaccharide repeating units
            
- **Basement membrane scaffolding formation on basolateral side of cell**
    
    Free ends of laminin polymers associate with receptors on endothelial cells such as integrin and dystroglycan, and hence laminin is closer to the cell surface
    
    Laminin associates with type IV collagen network via nidogens
    
    HSPG associates with laminin and collagen networks via heperan sulphate chains
