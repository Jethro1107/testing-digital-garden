### Fluid movement in the intestine

Fluid absorption and secretion occurs simutaneously to maintain fluid balance. Fluid absorption occurs predominantly via enterocytes of the jejunum, whereas fluid secretion occurs predominantly via crypt cells in the small and large intestine. Normally, fluid absorption should exceed fluid secretion, which results in net absorption of fluids in the GI tract.
