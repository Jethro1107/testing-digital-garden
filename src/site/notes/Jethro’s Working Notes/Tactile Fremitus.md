### **What is tactile fremitus?**

Tactile fremitus is the vibrations of chest wall when an individual speaks

### Clinical Skills - Assessing tactile fremitus

Place lateral end of the hand (or anywhere that is boney) onto the intercostal spaces, and ask an individual to say ‘一二三‘ softly

Proceed inferiorly through each intercostal space, and perform it both anteriorly and posteriorly

### Tactile fremitus in different diseased states

Cosolidation (e.g. pneumonia) results in increased fremitus

Effusion (both air and fluids) results in decreased fremitus
