### Peptic ulcer

- **What is a peptic ulcer?**
    
    Peptic ulcers are chronic ulceration (a loss of mucosa) along the upper GI tract due to action of gastric juice.
    
    These ulcers can be **duodenal** (most common, usually found in the first part of the duodenum), **gastric** (usually found in the antrum and the lesser curvature), **esophagus** (often a result of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Reflux esophagitis\|Reflux esophagitis]]), and rarely in the jejunum, and in gastroenterostomy stoma (if gastroenterostomy is performed).
    
- **Pathogenesis of peptic ulcer**
    
    Peptic ulcers are usually a result of an imbalance of aggressive factors (acid, pepsin), and defensive factors (mucus, bicarbonate, and cell renewal).
    
    Gastric ulcers are usually caused by inadequate defensive factors (against normal aggressive factors). Duodenal ulcers are usually caused by excess aggressive factors (against normal amounts of defensive factors.

    The imbalance of aggressive and defensive factors is largely associated with [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Helicobacter pylori\|Helicobacter pylori]] infections, drugs, cigarette smoking, and hypercalcemia.
    
    Helicobacter pylori infections - Accounts for 95% of duodenal ulcers and 75% of gastric ulcers.
    
    Drugs (NSAID, high dose corticosteroids) - Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis results in deminished blood flow and hence impaired healing.
    
    Hypercalcemia (e.g. as a result of hyperparathyroidism) - Results in increased gastrin release by G cells, and hence increased gastric acid secretion ([[The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine\|The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine]]).
    
- **Difference between acute and chronic peptic ulcers**
    
    Chronic peptic ulcers usually involve the formation of single, deep ulcers. Histologically, there is erosion of beyond the mucosa.
    
    Acute peptic ulcers usually involve the formation of multiple, shallow ulcers. Histologically, there is erosion of the mucosa only, involving less than the full thickness of the mucosa.

- **Histopathology of peptic ulcers**
    1. Loss of mucosa (or even deeper layers).
    2. Granulation tissue formation as a result of healing.
    3. Necrotic cellular debris and fibrinous exudates.

- **Clinical features of peptic ulcers**
    
    Signs and symptoms of peptic ulcers include:
    
    - Epigastric pain
    - Haemorrhage - Coughing of coffee ground material, haematemesis, melena
    - Anemia
- **Complications of peptic ulcer**
    1. **Hemorrhage - Occurs when their is invasion into vasculature.**
        
        Haemorrhage results in haematemesis (vomiting of coffee ground material or fresh blood, depending on extent of hemorrhage), or melena (bleeding into the bowel, resulting in foul-smelling, black, tarry stool).
        
    2. **Perforation - Usually occurs in chronic, deep peptic ulcers, but can occur in acute peptic ulcers as well.**
        
        This results in chemical and bacterial peritonitis.
        
    3. Penetration into adjacent organs (usually the pancreas)
    4. **Fibrosis and stenosis - Excessive repair and fibrosis results in stenosis (e.g. pyloric stenosis).**
        
        This rarely occurs due to early treatment.
