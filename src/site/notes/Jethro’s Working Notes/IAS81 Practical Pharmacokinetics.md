### Pharmacokinetics models

- What is the purpose of pharmocokinetic models?
    
    Hypothetical structures that describe the fate of a drug in a biological system following its administration
    
- What is the one compartment model?
    
    Assumes the body is a kinetically homogenous unit
    
    After administration, the drug achieves instantaneous distribution throughout the body and that the drug equilibrates instantaneously between tissues, resulting in a monophasic semilogarithmic curve plotting plasma concentration against time
    
    The decline in plasma concentration is only attributed to elimination as drug is distributed instataneously
    
- What is two compartment model?
    
    The body is separated into two compartments: Central compartments, and peripheral compartments
    
    Central compartments include the well-perfused organs and blood
    
    Peripheral compartments include tissues with less perfusion
    
    The drug first rapidly distribute to central compartment, and then slowly distribute to the rest of the body, thus there is no instataneous distribution between the two compartments
    
    There is a biphasic curve
    
    Initially there is a steeper decrease in plasma concentration owing to distribution and elimination, after equilibration is achieved between the two compartments, there is a more gentle decline in plasma concentration as it is only attributed by elimination
    
- What is multicompartment model?
    
    The body is separated into more than 1 compartment, such that the concentration time curve shows more than one exponential
    
- What are the two different pharmacokinetic processes?
    
    Permeation (absorption)
    
    Decomposition (elimination)
    
- What is the two types of pharmacokinetic reactions?
    
    Homogenous reaction
    
    Heterogenous reaction (most pharmacokinetics reaction)
    
- What is first-order process? Give the rate equation and the equation relating concentration with time. Elaborate on half life.
    
    Rate of decomposition depends on one concentration term
    
    Rate equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.37.03 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.37.03 PM.png]]
    
    Equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.37.29 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.37.29 PM.png]]
    
    Half life is constant (ln2/k):
    
    When initial concentration increases, half life remains constant, resulting in constant rate elimination
    
- What is second-order process? Give the rate equation and the equation relating concentration and time. Elaborate on half life and its implications.
    
    Rate of decomposition depends on the product of two concentration terms
    
    Rate equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.42.20 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.42.20 PM.png]]
    
    Equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.42.35 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.42.35 PM.png]]
    
    Half life is inversely proportional to initial concentration (1/C0k):
    
    When increasing dose, half life decrease, resulting in greater rate of elimination
    
    No point to increase dose if patient fails to respond
    
- What is zero-order process? Give the relation and the equation relating concentration and time. Elaborate on half life and its implications.
    
    Rate of decomposition is independent to concentration of drug
    
    Rate equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.45.00 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.45.00 PM.png]]
    
    Equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.45.07 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 5.45.07 PM.png]]
    
    Half life varies directly with with initial concentration (C0/2k):
    
    Increasing the dose will result in a greater half life, resulting in lower rate of elimination
    
    Dangerous for drugs with very narrow therapeutic windows
    

### Clinical Parameters

- What is volume of distribution?
    
    The amount of drug in the body to the concentration of drug in the blood or plasma
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.45.22 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.45.22 PM.png]]
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.45.22 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.45.22 PM.png]]
    
    Not necessarily an identifiable physiological volume, but merely refers to the fluid volume that would be required to contain all the drug in the body at the same concentration as in the blood concentration
    
    If volume of distribution is high, it indicates well distribution of drugs
    
- What are the factors affecting volume of distribution?
    
    Relative degree of binding to plasma and tissue proteins
    
    Lipid water partition coefficient of the drug
    
    Patient condition
    
- What is bioavailability? How is it calculated?
    
    Fractional extent to which a dose of drug has reach its site of action, or a body fluid with access to the site of action
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.24.23 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.24.23 PM.png]]
    
- What is clearance?
    
    A measure of the efficiency with which a drug is removed from the body, defined as the volume of plasma which is completely cleared of drug per unit time (unit: Volume per unit time)
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.35.22 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.35.22 PM.png]]
    
    mass/time divided by mass/volume = volume/time
    
    Note:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.40.49 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.40.49 PM.png]]
    
    volume/time times mass/volume = mass/time
    
    For a single dose of drug with 1st order kinetics of elimination
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.59.25 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 6.59.25 PM.png]]
    
- What are the factors affecting clearance?
    
    Hepatic clearance:
    
    Subjected to hepatic blood flow and efficiency of liver in drug clearance
    
    Renal clearance:
    
    Renal clearance involves glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion and passive tubular reabsorption
    
    Glomerular filtration is affected by renal blood flow
    
    Active tubular secretion depends the drugs binding to plasma proteins, and the saturation of transporters
    

### Clinical Pharmacokinetics

- Draw a concentration time curve and elaborate on MEC, duration of action, and intensity.
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 8.59.39 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 8.59.39 PM.png]]
    
    For a single dose of oral dosage form, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination occurs simultaneously
    
    Hence, the rise in drug concentration of blood merely indicates that rate of absorption is greater than rate of elimination
    
    The decrease in drug concentration indicates the rate of absorption is lower than rate of elimination
    
    The two intersection points between curve and minimal effective concentration for desired response bounds the duration of action
    
    The delta between peak effect and the MEC for desired response marks the intensity
    
    Peak effect doesn't really matter, as long as it is within the therapeutic window
    
- Elaborate on multiple doses.
    
    After initial doses, subsequent doses are administered when plasma concentration falls due to elimination
    
    Subsequent doses are administered preferentially at multiples of half-time
    
    The administration rate remains constant, but accumulation of drugs increases, causing increase in rate of elimination of drug
    
    The curve plateaus off at steady state concentration as administration rate equals the elimination rate
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.26.48 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.26.48 PM.png]]
    
    The steady-state concentration should remain within the therapeutic window
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.29.20 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.29.20 PM.png]]
    
    The dosage rate of drugs can be determined as the following equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.37.12 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.37.12 PM.png]]
    
    Where, F and CL are given and constant, Dosage rate is the only variable affecting Css
    
    Note that the steady state is often attained after 4 half-times
    
- What is the maintenance dose?
    
    Drugs administered in a series of repetitive doses or as a continuous infusion as to maintain a stead state concentration within a therapeutic window
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.37.12 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.37.12 PM.png]]
    
- Elaborate on loading doses.
    
    In emergency, a loading dose can be used to reach target concentration (Ess) rapidly
    
    To calculate loading dose, we can , modify the equation to find the volume of distribution:
    
    V = F*dose (amount of drug in the body) /Cp
    
    hence, by rearranging the equation:
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.47.22 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-07 at 9.47.22 PM.png]]
    
- What is therapeutic drug monitoring? When is it used?
    
    By constant monitoring concentration of drug at steady state to refine the estimate of CL/F for the patient to be treated
    
    The CL/F ratio can then be used to adjust the maintainence dose to achieve the target concentration
