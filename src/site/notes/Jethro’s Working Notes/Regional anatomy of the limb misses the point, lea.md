### Regional anatomy of the limb misses the point, learning anatomy of the limbs by structure reveals its clinical significance

When studying `upper limb` and `lower limb` `anatomy`, i found it difficult to keep up with the the dissection schedule. I wanted to get a general understanding of the structures present within the region before I go in a dissect that region. Itâ€™s the least I can do for the cadaver and his/her family. However, with how the lectures are organized, it made it difficult for me to learn everything on time before dissection. Hereâ€™s an example:

The dissection for the pectoral region, axillary region and anterior arm is in Week 3, it covers the associated bones and joints (taught in week 1), muscles (taught in week 2), nerves (taught in week 3) and blood vessels (taught in week 3). This meant that while I was able to learn the bony framework and muscles that define these regions in sufficient time (as they are taught earlier), I had to rush my review on the brachial plexus, and donâ€™t have sufficient time to review the vascular supply in these regions.

Why not just teach it using the methadology of ****************regional anatomy****************, in fact, textbooks like Grayâ€™s anatomy teaches upper and lower limb anatomy by the regions. However, regional anatomy misses the point, that there are associations between different structures in different regions, with clinical significance. An example is required to reinforce this point. Terminal branches of the brachial plexus, such as the radial nerve, median nerve and ulnar nerve innervate muscles and skin at different regions of the upper limb, it would be unwise for us to learn it with the regional anatomy approach.
