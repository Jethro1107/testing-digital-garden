- Pathology of acute CAP
    
    
    - **Morphological changes/pathology of bacterial pneumonia**
        
        Early stage: Congestion and oedema
        
        Congestion of capillaries and exudate filling up the alveolar space
        
        Intermediate stage: Consolidation
        
        Alveolar space fills up with neutrophils, forming solidification (replacement of air by exudates) of the lungs
        
        Late stage: Resolution or complications
        
        Resolution - infection controlled and inflammation subsides
        
        Complications - destruction of lung parenchyma/spread of infection
        
    
    - What are the cardinal signs of acute inflammation?
        
        Rubor - Redness
        
        Tumor - Swelling
        
        Calor - Warmth
        
        Dolor - Pain
        
        Functio laesa - Loss of function
        
- [[Pathophysiology of pneumonia\|Pathophysiology of pneumonia]]
    - Decrease in surface area -> Diffusion impairments
    - VQ mismatching - caused uneven epithelial and endothelial damage
- Pneumonia is [[Restrictive lung disease\|Restrictive lung disease]]
    - Restrictive lung disease, a problem with inspiration, contrasting obstructive lung disease, which is a problem with expiration
    - FEV1 and FVC is both reduced where decrease in FVC is greater than FEV1, hence, FEV1/FVC ratio increase (>80%)
