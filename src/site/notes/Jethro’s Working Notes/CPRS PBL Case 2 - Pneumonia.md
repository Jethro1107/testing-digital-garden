- Pathology of acute CAP
    
    
    - **Morphological changes/pathology of bacterial pneumonia**
        
        Early stage: Congestion and oedema
        
        Congestion of capillaries and exudate filling up the alveolar space
        
        Intermediate stage: Consolidation
        
        Alveolar space fills up with neutrophils, forming solidification (replacement of air by exudates) of the lungs
        
        Late stage: Resolution or complications
        
        Resolution - infection controlled and inflammation subsides
        
        Complications - destruction of lung parenchyma/spread of infection
        
    
    - What are the cardinal signs of acute inflammation?
        
        Rubor - Redness
        
        Tumor - Swelling
        
        Calor - Warmth
        
        Dolor - Pain
        
        Functio laesa - Loss of function
        
- [[Pathophysiology of pneumonia\|Pathophysiology of pneumonia]]
    - Decrease in surface area -> Diffusion impairments
    - VQ mismatching - caused uneven epithelial and endothelial damage
- Pneumonia is [[Restrictive lung disease\|Restrictive lung disease]]
    - Restrictive lung disease, a problem with inspiration, contrasting obstructive lung disease, which is a problem with expiration
    - FEV1 and FVC is both reduced where decrease in FVC is greater than FEV1, hence, FEV1/FVC ratio increase (>80%)

- **Clinical manifestations of pertussis**
    
    Classical pertussis presents with 3 phases: Catarrhal stage, paroxysmal stage and covalescent stage
    
    Catarrhal stage (non-specific) - Rhinorrhea, lacrimation, conjuctival injection, low grade fever, dry cough
    
    Paroxysmal stage (specific):
    
    Hallmark symptom of pertussis - Paroxysmal cough, i.e. a series of severe, vigorous cough with little to no inspiratory efforts in between, followed by an inspiratory whoop, the forced inspiratory effort following each attack

    Postussive emesis (vomiting) often vollows the paroxysmal cough
    
    Covalescent stage - cough subsides after weeks or months
