### Muai Thai - September

Hopefully I could make 2 sessions per week, anymore would probably interfere with my studies though.

Available Sessions: 9:45 - 10:55, 11:00 - 12:10, 5:30 - 6:30, 6:30 - 7:30

Monday and Thursday morning sessions are not available as they clash with PBL tutorials (9:30am to 11:30am)

### Week 1

Went on Monday and Tuesday, might squeeze in a session on friday/saturday.

### Week 2

GI08-GI17, lots of lectures to cover

Thursday and Friday are a no go, have to spend an entire day at med campus

Available sessions: Monday 11am, Tuesday 945am, Wednesday 530pm, Saturday

### Week 3

GI18-GI26

Same as week 2, Thursday and Friday are a no go

I have day off on Monday and Wednesday though

### Week 4

GI27-GI31

Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are a no go, have to spend an entire day at med campus
