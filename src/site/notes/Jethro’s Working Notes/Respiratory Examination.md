# Respiratory Examination

# Respiratory examination

Respiratory examination always starts with general inspection of the patient. Followed by palpation, percussion and auscultation.

### Inspection

During inspection, it is best to move down the body, cranially to caudally to avoid missing certain aspects of the body.

**Head**

Check for conjunctival pallor:

Check for central cyanosis at the tongue (always pathological):

Note that [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Central cyanosis is always pathological\|Central cyanosis is always pathological]], whereas [[Peripheral cyanosis can be physiological or pathological\|Peripheral cyanosis can be physiological or pathological]].

**Neck**

Check for cervical lymphandenopathy in the following order:

Submental LN → Submandibular LN → Preauricular LN, Postauricular LN → Upper cervical LN → Middle cervical LN → Lower cervical LN → Supraclavicular LN in the supraclavicular fossa

Report ‘LN are not tender or enlarged’ if no significant findings.

**Hands**

Check for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clubbing\|Clubbing]] 

Check for tar stainings (for smoking history)

**Legs**

Check for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pitting oedema\|Pitting oedema]] 

### Clinical skills - Assessing pitting oedema

Pitting oedema is assessed by pressing on boney parts of the ankle, starting at the anterior part of the medial malleolus

If pitting oedema is present, proceed up along the leg to detect the level of pitting oedema

**Chest**

Check for chest wall deformities e.g. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pectus excavatum\|Pectus excavatum]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pectus carinatum\|Pectus carinatum]], Barrel chest, or kyphoscoliosis and scars in anterior chest wall and axillary region

Check for lung expansion (assymetrical lung expansion may reveal the diseased side)

Count respiratory rate - for 15 seconds, and extrapolate to 1 minute

Also note the use of accessory muscles during respiration, and whether the patient is dyspnoeic

### Palpation

Four things are assessed during palpation: Tracheal position, Apex beat, chest expansion and tactile fremitus

**Tracheal position**

Place index and ring finger on either sides of the sternal heads of sternocleidomastoid muscle, run middle finger down the trachea **gently** and assess whether its distance to the index and ring finger are equal

Cf: [[$ Stanford Medicine 25 - Examination of the Trachea\|$ Stanford Medicine 25 - Examination of the Trachea]] 

**Apex beat** - To determine the most inferolateral part of the heart beat

**Chest expansion - Assessing outward expansion**

Place two hands on the side of the chest of the patient, suspending the thumb above the patient’s chest

Ask the patient to take a deep breath and observe whether the outward movement of the thumb is equal

Perform this anteriorly and posteriorly, both on the upper side and lower side

Cf: [[Jethro’s Working Notes/$ Youtube video on chest expansion technique\|$ Youtube video on chest expansion technique]] 

**Tactile fremitus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tactile Fremitus\|Tactile Fremitus]])**

### Clinical Skills - Assessing tactile fremitus

Place lateral end of the hand (or anywhere that is boney) onto the intercostal spaces, and ask an individual to say ‘一二三‘ softly

Proceed inferiorly through each intercostal space, and perform it both anteriorly and posteriorly

### Percussion

From inspection and palpation, one could expect which side is normal and which side is diseased. When performing [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Percussion of the lungs\|Percussion of the lungs]] , always start with the expected normal side as to give a point of reference.

**Technique -** When percussing, place the middle finger on the intercostal space, and try to spread the skin with the other fingers to increase tension. Lightly tap the middle finger with the other hand with a wrist swinging motion. A technique I discovered is to percuss lightly. It is easier to differentiate between something (resonance in the lungs) and nothing (dullness in the liver or cardiac areas)

Percussion should involve both lung apices (in the supraclavicular fossa), both clavicles, and intercostal spaces both anteriorly and posteriorly. When percussing anteriorly, one should also percuss the axillary region (lateral side).

- 3 sounds of lung percussion and associated conditions
    
    Hyperesonance - Pneumothorax, emphysema
    
    Dullness (Normal cardiac dullness, liver dullness) -  Pleural effusion, consolidations or lung collapse
    
    Tympany
    
- Assessing areas of dullness
    
    If the upper border of liver dullness (normally right 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line) is depressed, or areas of cardiac dullness is deminished, hyperinflation (due to emphysema or asthma) is indicated.
    

### Auscultation

### Clinical skills - Auscultation of the lungs

Auscultation of the lungs should be performed on both lung apices, the intercostal spaces both anteriorly and posteriorly, and laterally.

Compare breath sounds on both sides:

Normal - Vesicular breath sounds

Reduced breath sounds - lung collapse, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, emphysema, thick chest wall, poor chest movement

Increased breath sounds - thin chest wall, increased respiratory efforts

Bronchial breath sounds - Consolidations

Crackles

Crepitations

Wheezing
