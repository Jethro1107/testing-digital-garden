### Etiology of lung cancer

- **4 common upstream etiology of lung cancer**
    
    Tobacco / cigarette smoking
    
    Chronic inflammation
    
    Occupational and environmental factors (e.g. heavy metals, benzo[a]pyrene, radon etc.)
    
    Incomplete combustion of fuel
    
- **Most important etiology of lung cancer**
    
    Tobacco is the single most important etiology of lung cancer
    
    1. Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens, which are initiating agents that covalently bind to DNA to form DNA adducts, affecting DNA replication and repair, thus causing mutations
    2. Tobacco also causes inflammation, which results in production of ROS, which causes DNA damage
- **How does chronic inflammation predispose to lung cancer?**
    
    During chronic inflammation, inflammatory cells and macrophages are activated
    
    They release inflammatory mediators and ROS
    
    1. Inflammatory mediators activate growth pathways, inducing proliferation for healing
        
        Persistent cell proliferation predisposes to mutations
        
    2. ROS increases oxidative stress, which can cause direct DNA damage
- Genetic basis of lung cancer

### Morphological classification of lung cancer

    Epithelial cells of respiratory epithelium
    
- **Histological classification of primary lung carcinoma**
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    - Adenocarcinoma
        - **Cells of origin in adenocarcinoma**
            
            Derived from cells lining distal to terminal bronchioles and alveoli
            
        - **Morphological progression of adenocarcinoma**
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Dysplasia → Carcinoma-in-situ → Adenocarcinoma
            
            Dysplasia - Cells show dysplastic changes, but with no evidence of invasion into stroma or tumour mass formation
            
            Carcinoma-in-situ - Involves dysplastic change in the entire airway epithelium, but with no invasion into stroma
            
            Adenocarcinoma - Invades into the stroma, which is a hallmark of cancer
            
        - **Growth patterns of adenocarcinoma**
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Acinar-predominant: Mucin forming glandular structures
            
            Papillary-predominant: Consist of branching finger-like stroma core lined by tumour cells
            
            Lepidic predominant (better prognosis): Tumour cells line the alveolar wall with minimal stroma invasion
            
            Solid (worse prognosis): Tumour cells are lined in sheets, with no acinar, papillary or lepidic pattern
            
        - Mucinous adenocarcinoma
            - **Properties of mucinous adenocarcinoma**
                
                Tumour cells lining the alveolar wall producing large amounts of mucin

    - Squamous cell carcinoma
        - **Risk factors of squamous cell carcinoma**
            
            Cigarette smoke can cause irritation of respiratory epithelium that causes metaplasia from respiratory type to squamous type
            
            In smokers, the entire respiratory epithelium is at increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma (Field effect)
            
        - **Cell of origin in squamous cell carcinoma**
            
            Tend to arise in major bronchi
            
        - **Morphological progression of squamous cell carcinoma**
            
            Metaplasia → Dysplasia → Carcinoma-in-situ → Squamous cell carcinoma
            
            Metaplasia - Tobacco smoking causes irritation of epithelium and leads to metaplasia from respiratory type to squamous type
            
            Dysplasia - Cells exhibit dysplastic change, with no invasion into the stroma
            
            Carcinoma-in-situ - Involves dysplastic change in the entire airway epithelium, but with no invasion into stroma
            
            Small cell carcinoma - Invades through the stroma

        - **Morphology of small cell lung carcinoma**
            
            Diffuse sheets of small cells (<3-4 times of lymphocyte) with dysplastic changes (High N:C ratio, hyperchromatic nuclei, with indistinct nucleolus, **fine granular chromatin**)
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Necrosis is common due to high mitotic count
            
            Basophilic staining of vessel wall is common due to encrustation of DNA from necrotic tumour cells (Azzopardi effect)

### Lung cancer spread and staging

- **Metastatic routes of lung cancer**
    - Local spread to adjacent organs
        - **Common sites of local spread and their effects**
            
            Eosophagus - dysphagia
            
            Brachial plexus - pain, wasting of arm muscles
            
            Pleura, pericardium - effusion
            
            Chest wall - mass formation
            
    - Lymphatic spread
        - **Common sites of lymphatic spread**
            
            Lymph nodes - hilar, mediastinal, supraclavicular
            
            Pleural lymphatics - effusion
            
    - Haematogenous spread
        - **Common lung carcinomas for haematogenous spread**
            
            Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), adenocarcinoma
            
- Staging of lung cancer
    - **Staging of non-small cell lung carcinoma**
        
        Use of TNM staging system (integrated into an overall stage, i.e. stage I to IV)
        
        T - tumour size and extent of local spread
        
        N - extent of lymph node metastasis

        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]

### Clinical presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer

- **Clinical presentation of lung cancer**
    
    Related to local disease:
    
    Cough, haemoptysis, bronchial obstruction (predisposes to pulmonary infections)
    
    Related to metastatic disease:
    
    Pleural effusion (shortness of breath), Lymphandenopathy, distant metastasis
    
    - Paraneoplastic syndrome
        - **What is paraneoplastic syndrome?**
            
            Paraneoplastic syndrome refers to the non-metastatic clinical syndromes or systemic effects that accompany a malignant disease
            
            It may be present before the tumour is detected, where removal of tumour can relieve symptoms
            
        - **Mechanism of paraneoplastic syndrome**
            
            It is caused by circulating tumour derived factors causing distant effects
            
            1. Immunopathological damage
                
                Antibodies and T cell immune response against Tumour cells may cross react with normal cells, causing damage to normal tissues
                
            2. Non immunological factors
                
                Production of cytokines, hormones or peptides that affect other organs in distant sites
                
        - **Common paraneoplastic syndrome manifestations in lung carcinoma**
            
            Systemic effects - Fever, loss of apetite (due to cytokine effect)
            
            Hormonal effects (associated with small cell lung carcinoma):
            
            Ectopic adrenalcorticotropic hormone and Cushing syndrome
            
            Ectopic ADH and SIADH/hyponatremia
            
            Ectopic Parathyroid hormone (associated with squamous cell carcinoma) and hypercalcemia
            
            Immunological effects:
            
            Acute cerebral degeneration (associated with adenocarcinoma) - due to autoantibodies that cross react with cerebral cells
            
- **Diagnostic approach of lung cancer**
    
    Always rule out metastatic cancer, as metastatic cancer is more common primary tumours

### Targeted therapy in lung cancer therapy

- **Rationale behind molecular/genetic diagnosis of lung cancer**
    
    It is important to know whether there are any actionable or drugable genetic aberrations so that we can offer target therapy to patients with lung cancer
    
    Target therapy often are more tolerable than systemic chemotherapy 
    
- **Common targetable growth pathways in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)**
    - EGFR
        - **Mechanism of activation of EGFR**
            
            Activated by ATP binding to activation loop
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Mechanism of EGFR mutations and its effects**
            
            EGFR mutations from exon 18-21 (kinase domain), causes a conformational change, which favours ATP binding, such that the EGFR pathway becomes constitutively active
            
        - **Targeted therapy against EGFR mutations**
            
            Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) binds to EGFR receptor more strongly than ATP, thus inhibiting EGFR
            
        - **Mechanism of resistance against targeted therapy and implications**
            
            Prolonged TKI treatment may result in resistance mutations, which would favour ATP binding over TKI
            
            Thus, genetic diagnosis and change of therapy is required
            
    - ALK
        - **Mechanism of ALK mutation and its effects**
            
            ALK is not normally expressed
            
            Translocation of a highly expressed 5’ partner gene (e.g. EML4, KIF5B) to 3’ ALK segment containing the kinase domain
            
            This results in a highly expressed fusion gene with oncogenic functions
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Targeted therapy against ALK mutations**
            
            ALK inhibitors
            
- Immune checkpoints
    - **Example of immune checkpoint escape and its mechanism**
        
        PDL1-PD1 checkpoint
        
        Tumour cells express PDL1, which binds to PD1 on cytotoxic T cells, thus supressing CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Immunotherapy for PDL1- PD1 checkpoint**
        
        Anti-PDL1 inhibitors and Anti-PD1 inhibitors cause immune checkpoint blockade
