### The distinction between Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative colitis is primarily based on morphology

|  | Crohn’s disease | Ulcerative colitis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bowel involvement | Small and large bowel (typically in terminal ileum and colon) | Only in the colon |
| Lesion Distribution | Skip lesions (consisting of normal mucosa between two inflamed segments) | Diffuse inflammation of the colon starting from rectum |
| Ulcers | Deep, knife like fissures between normal mucosa, giving a ‘cobblestone mucosa’ appearance.
A central elongated serpentine ulcer that runs along the long axis of the bowel is often present. | Ulcers with a broad base, with pseudopolyps  formation |
| Strictures | Thickened bowel wall results in strictures | Rare strictures |
| Serosal involvement | Fat wrapping around serosa (’creeping fat’) | No serosal involvement |
| Extent of inflammation | Transmural | Only involve mucosa and submucosa |
