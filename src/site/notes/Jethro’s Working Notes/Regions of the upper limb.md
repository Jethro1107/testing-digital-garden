### Regions of the upper limb

The regions of the upper limb are defined roughly by the joints and the component bones.

The upper limb is roughly separated into:

- The shoulder - The region of upper limb attachment to the trunk
- The arm (Brachium) - The region between the shoulder and the elbow joint
- The forearm (Antebrachium) - The region between the elbow joint to the wrist joint
- The Hand - The region distal to the wrist joint

Note that the arm and forearm is separated by a depressed region called the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cubital fossa\|Cubital fossa]].

Also, note that the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axilla\|Axilla]] serves the transition between the neck region to the arm, bypassing the shoulder region.
