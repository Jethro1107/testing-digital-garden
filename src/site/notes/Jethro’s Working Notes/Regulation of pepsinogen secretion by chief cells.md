### Regulation of pepsinogen secretion by chief cells

Pepsinogen secretion by chief cells is regulated by 1) acetylcholine and 2) H+ in the stomach.

Acetylcholine is released by the vagus nerve and the local [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]].

H+ in stomach stimulates a local enteric reflex via the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]], which results in further release of pepsinogen by chief cells.
