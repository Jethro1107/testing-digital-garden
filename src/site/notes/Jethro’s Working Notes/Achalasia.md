### Achalasia

- **What is achalasia?**
    
    Achalasis is characterised by the triad of failure of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation, increased LES tone, and esophageal apersitalsis.
    
- **Pathogenesis of achalasia**
    
    Primary achalasia is by definition idiopathic, but is associated with the failure distal inhibitory neurons (in myenteric plexus proximal to LES).
    
    This results in the loss of intrinsic inhibitory innervation of LES and muscularis externa of the oesophagus.
    
    The functional obstruction results in subsequent dilitation and fibrosis of the proximal part of esophagus.
