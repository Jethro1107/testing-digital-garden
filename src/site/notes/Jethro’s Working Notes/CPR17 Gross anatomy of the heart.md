### Cardiovascular system

- **Components of the cardiovascular system**
    - Consists of the heart, blood vessels and approximately 5L of blood
- **Function of cardiovascular system**
    - Moves blood throughout the body, transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, carbon dioxide and cellular waste products
- **Divisions of the cardiovascular system**
    - Pulmonary circuit - carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for gas exchange, and returns oxygenated blood to the heart
        - Right atrium ⇒ Right ventricle ⇒ Pulmonary trunk ⇒ Lungs (gas exchange) ⇒ Pulmonary veins ⇒ Left atrium
    - Systemic circuit - carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the whole body (including lungs and heart), and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart
        - Left atrium ⇒ Left ventricle ⇒ Arterial system ⇒ Capillaries ⇒ Venous system ⇒ Right atrium

### Heart

- **Function of the heart**
    - To pump blood through both pulmonary and systemic circuit, where pulmonary circuit is supplied by the right heart, and the systemic circuit is supplied by the left heart
    - To genenerate and regulate blood pressure
- Cardiac orientation
    - **Size of the heart**
        - The size of a fist or two hands claspsed together
    - **Shape and orientation of the heart**
        - The heart resembles a tilted inverted pyramid, with the apex pointing anteriorly, inferiorly and to the left
        - The base of the heart is a the broad superior portion that can only be viewed posteriorly, and is for attachment of the great vessels
        - The apex of the heart is the inferior blunt tip lies immediately above the diaphragm,
        - Other than the 4 base and apex, the heart has another 4 surfaces:
            - The inferior (diaphragmatic) surface which is superior to the diaphragm,
            - The anterior (sternocostal) surface which is posterior to the sternum,
            - And the left and right pulmonary surfaces which are medial to the pleural cavities

            - **Mechanism of tricuspid valve in ensuring one way flow of blood**
                - During ventricular filling, since the atrial pressure is greater than ventricular pressure, the cusps project into the right ventricle, allowing the tricuspid valve to open
                - During ventricular contraction, the pressure difference between right ventricle and right atrium would cause the cusps to prolapse into the right atrium, but the contraction of papillary muscles attached to the cusps via chordae tendineae prevents the cusps from prolapsing into right atrium, such that the tricuspid valve close to prevent blood regurgitation back into the right atrium

                - A thin upper membranous part
                - A thick lower muscular part
        - **Comparison between left ventricle and right ventricle**
            - The walls of the left ventricle is 2-3 times thicker than that of the right ventricle and the force produced is 4-6 times that of right ventricle, as the left ventricle has to generate more force to conduct blood to the entire body

                - The semilunar cusps and the wall of the ascending aorta forms pocket-like aortic sinuses
            - **Mechanism of aortic valve in ensuring one way flow of blood**
                - After ventricular contraction, recoil of blood fills the aortic sinuses, which forces the semilunar cusps, and hence the aortic valve to shut, preventing refilling of the left ventricle
- Heart valves and the flow of blood

        - **Two basic types of valvular heart diseases**
            - Stenosis - inability of the valve to open fully due to hardening of the valve, causing narrowing of the oriface
            - Incompetence (insufficiency) - inability of the valve to close completely
        - **Causes of heart valve regurgitation (mitral regurgitation as example)**
            - Degenerative MR due to mitral valve prolapse
            - Degenerative MR due to flailed cusps (damage to chordae tendineae)
            - Functional MR due to enlargement of AV oriface due to increase in size of heart

### Cardiac conduction system

- **Cardiac conduction system and its function**
    - The cardiac conduction system is made of a network of myocardial conducting cells that initiate and conduct electrical impulses locally, ensuring that the contraction of the four heart chambers are coordinated with each other
- **Components of the cardiac conduction system**
    - [[Sinu-atrial node\|Sinu-atrial node]]
    - [[Atrioventricular node\|Atrioventricular node]]
    - [[Atrioventricular bundle\|Atrioventricular bundle]] - Bundle of His and bundle branches
    - Purkinje fibres
- **Action of the cardiac conduction system**
    - The electrical impulse is generated by the sinu-atrial node spreads across the walls of the atria, causing the atria to contract
    - Concurrently, the electrical impulse stimulates the atrioventricular node, which delays the impulse
    - The impulse then travels along the atrioventricular bundles along the membranous part of interventricular septum, before splitting into the right and left bundles
    - The right bundle runs along the right side of the interventricular septum towards the apex of the right ventricle, from the interventricular septum, it shortcuts through the septomarginal trabecula to the base of the anterior papillary muscles, where it branches into Purkinje fibres, supplying the right ventricular musculature, including the papillary muscles
    - The left bundle runs along the left side of the interventricular septum towards the apex of the left ventricle. Along it’s course, it branches to give Purkinje fibres, supplying the left ventricular musculature

### Cardiac skeleton

- **What is the [[Cardiac skeleton\|Cardiac skeleton]]?**
    - The cardiac skeleton is a collection of dense fibrous connective tissue in forms of 4 rings with interconnecting areas in a plane separating the atria and the ventricles
- **Structures of cardiac skeleton**
    - **The 4 rings:**
    - The left fibrous ring surround the left atrioventricular oriface, or the mitral valve
    - The right fibrous ring surround the right atrioventricular oriface, or the tricuspid valve
    - The pulmonary ring surrounds the opening of the pulmonary trunk, at the pulmonary valve
    - The aortic ring surrounds the opening of the aorta, at the aortic valve
    - **The interconnected areas:**
    - The right fibrous trigone, which is a thickned layer of connective tissue between the aortic ring and the right fibrous ring, which consist of hole for the atrioventricular bundle to run through
    - The left fibrous trigone, which is a thickened layer of connective tissue between the aortic ring and the left fibrous ring
    - The Conus tendon, between the pulmonary ring and the aortic ring
    - Membranous part of interventricular septum
- **Function of cardiac skeletion**
    - Maintains the structural integrity of the openings it surrounds
    - Anchors the heart valve cusps
    - Provides a point of insertion and separation of atrial and ventricular musculature (physical separation of atria and ventricle)
    - Provides electrical insulation between atria and ventricles, where the only electrical connection is the atrioventricular bundle running along the right fibrous trigone

### Blood supply and innervation of the heart

- Coronary Circulation
    - **General overview of coronary circulation**
        - Coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses and supply the muscle and the heart
        - Cardiac veins collect the venous blood and returns them to the right atrium through the coronary sinus
    - Blood vessels in coronary circulation
        
        
        - Coronary arteries
            - **Two main coronary arteries**
                - Right coronary artery
                    - **Structures supplied by right coronary artery**
                        - Right atrium, right ventricle, a portion of the left atrium, SA node, AV node, the interatrial septum, the posteroinferior one third of interventricular septum, and the posterior part of the left ventricle
                    - **Origin and course of right coronary artery**
                        - Originates from right aortic sinus, passes anteriorly and immediately descend along the coronary sulcus and course towards the inferior margin of the heart
                        - On reaching inferior margin of the heart, it turns posteriorly and continues in the coronary sulcus onto the diaphragmatic surface and the base of the heart
                    - **Branches of right coronary artery**
                        - Sinu-atrial nodal branch - An early atrial branch passing through the groove between the right auricle and ascending aorta, and gives off the sinu-atrial nodal branch, which passes posteriorly around the superior vena cava to supply ths sinu-atrial node
                        - Right marginal branch - A branch given off as the right coronary artery approaches the inferior margin of the heart
                        - Posterior interventricular branch - A branch of right coronary artery on the diaphragmatic surface of the heart, which descends along the posterior interventricular sulcus towards the apex of the heart

                    - **Origin and course of left coronary artery**
                        - Originates from left aortic sinus, and passes through the groove between left auricle and pulmonary trunk and immediately branches into two terminal branches after emerging from behind the pulmonary trunk
                    - **Branches of left coronary artery**
                        - The anterior interventricular branch (left anterior descending artery - LAD) - A terminal branch of the left coronary artery that descends towards the apex of the heart along the anterior interventricular sulcus, where it may consist of one or two large diagonal branches descending diagonally across the anterior surface of the left ventricle
                        - The circumflex branch - A terminal branch of left coronary artery that courses left along coronary sulcus onto the diaphragmatic surface of the heart and ends before reaching interventricular sulcus
                        - Left marginal branch - A branch of of the circumflex branch coursing along the obtuse margin of the heart
