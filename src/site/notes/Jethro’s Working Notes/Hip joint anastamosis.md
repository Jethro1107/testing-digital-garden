### Hip joint anastamosis

The hip joint anastamosis is an arterial anastamosis over the hip joint between branches of the internal iliac artery, superior and inferior gluteal artery, and the branches of deep femoral artery, the circumflex humeral arteries and 1st perforating branch of deep femoral artery.

It provides collateral blood supply between internal iliac artery and external iliac artery, to maintain blood supply to the lower limb when the external iliac artery is blocked.
