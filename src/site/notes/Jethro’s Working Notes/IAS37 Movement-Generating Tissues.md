### Classification of muscle

- What are muscles? What are their primary function?
    
    Muscles - tissues containing specialised elongated cells involved in contraction
    
- What are the three types of muscles? Where can they be found?
    
    Skeletal muscles - skeleton-attached and visceral stiated
    
    Cardiac muscles - heart, Vena Cava, pulmonary veins
    
    Smooth muscles
    
- What are the criteria for classifying skeletal muscle fibres?
    
    By Contraction speed
    
    By ATP enzyme velocity
    
    By metabolic profile
    

- What are the three types of skeletal muscle fibres? What are their functions and properties?
    
    Type I (slow oxidative)
    
    slow-twitch fatigue resistant
    
    Slow ATP enzyme velocity
    
    ATP mainly produced my oxidative phosphorylation
    
    High oxidative enzyme activity
    
    Consist of large amounts of myoglobin, mitochondria and blood capillaries, giving the muscle fibre red colour
    
    Involved in long, slow contractions and sustained aerobic activities, e.g maintaining posture by postural muscles, and in marathon runners
    
    Type IIb (fast glycolytic)
    
    Fast-twitch, fatigue-prone
    
    Fast ATP enzyme velocity
    
    ATP mainly produced by glycolysis
    
    High anaerobic enzyme activity
    
    Consist of smaller amounts of myoglobin, mitochondria and blood capillaries, giving the muscle fibre white colour
    
    Involved in short, fast contractions and fine movements, e.g. biceps and triceps, muscles involved in fine movements
    
    Type IIa (fast oxidative glycolytic)
    
    Fast-twitch
    
    Intermediate properties
    

### Skeletal muscle

- Describe the level of organization of a skeletal muscle.
    
    A muscle fibre is a single muscle cell consisting of many myofibrils
    
    A muscle fibre is surrounded by endomysium, loose connective tissues surrounding the muscle fibre to support it
    
    Many muscle fibres performing the same task are grouped together to form the muscle fascicle
    
    The Muscle fasicle is enclosed by the perimysium, a thicker layer of connective tissue consist of thicker blood vessels and nerve endings surrounding muscle fascicle
    
    Many muscle fascicles group together to form the skeletal muscle
    
    The muscle fascicles are bundled together by the epimysium, a thick, dense, irregular connective tissue
    
- Describe the structure of skeletal muscle fibres.
    
    Muscle fibres consist of myofibrils, such that they are striated
    
    Many nucleus of the muscle fibre is located peripherally
    
- What is the basic unit of myofibril?
    
    Sarcomere, consisting of interlaced thick and thin filaments
    
- What are the different bands and lines of a sarcomere?
    
    I band - thin filament only, less dense and thus a lighter colour
    
    A band - length of thick filament, denser than thin filament and thus darker in colour
    
    H band - region with thick filament only, less dense than the A band overlap but more dense than I band
    
    M line marks the middle of thick filament
    
    Z-line are the borders of sarcomere

- How are different organelles organised in a skeletal muscle fibre?
    
    T-tubules are invaginations of the sarcolemma at AI junction, involved in conducting action potential from sarcolemma into the muscle fibre, and eventually trigger Ca2+ release by SR
    
    SR is responsible for storing and releasing Ca2+
    
    Extensive network of SR surrounds each myofibrils, with one section defined between two AI-junction
    
    SR at AI junctions form a swelling region called the terminal cisternae of SR
    
    2 terminal cisternae and one T-tubule forms a triad

- Describe the sliding mechanism that leads to contraction of muscle cell.
    
    Thin filament slides towards M line
    
    I band and H band both shorten
    
    A band remains unchanged as it is defined as the length of thick filament
    
    However, A band overlap increases in length

- Describe the contractile cycle.
    
    Contractile cycle begins - Contractile cycle begins with the arrival of Ca2+ to the zone of overlap
    
    Active site site exposure - Ca2+ binds to troponin to change its position, rolling away tropomyosin to expose the active site on actin
    
    Cross-bridge formation - Myosin head binds to active site to form a cross bridge. Phosphate group is lost from myosin head to strengthen the interaction between myosin head and actin, i.e. strengthen the cross bridge
    
    Power stroke/ myosin head pivot - ADP is released. Energy stored in myosin head is released as myosin head pivots towards the M-line, pulling the thin-filament towards M-line
    
    Cross-bridge detachment - New ATP binds to myosin head to detach myosin head from active site on Actin
    
    Myosin head reactivation - Hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and P enegises/reactivates myosin head, recocking the myosin head
    
- When does skeletal muscle proliferation stop?
    
    24th week of embryonic development
    
- How is the repair and renewal of skeletal muscles carried out?
    
    Muscle satellite cells proliferate and fuse with muscle fibre during injury
    
    However, number of such cells is limited
    
- Describe hypertrophy, dystrophy and atrophy.
    
    Hypertrophy - increase in size of skeletal muscle fibres, no increase in number of skeletal muscle fibres
    
    Dystrophy - muscle cell death due to malfunction of protein production in muscle cells
    
    Atrophy - muscle cell death due to lack of nutrition, from starvation or anorexia
    

### Neuromuscular junction

- Describe the motor and sensory innervation present in skeletal muscles.
    
    Motor innervation between CNS and muscle fibres present
    
    Nervous innervation between stretch receptors/sensory muscle spindle cells to CNS present
    
- What is a motor unit?
    
    Motor unit - sum of muscle fibres controlled by one motor neuron
    
- With comparison with the bicep, how do motor units in muscles controlling our digit differ?
    
    Each motor units generally control less muscle fibres
    
    Hence for the same amount of muscle fibres, more neurons are required to control them
    
- What is a neuromuscular junction?
    
    Also known as motor end plate
    
    It is a peripheral chemical synapse between motor neuron and muscle fibres
    
    Acetylcholine as the neurotransmitter
    
- Why are there junctional folds on the muscle fibre in a NMJ?
    
    To increase surface area for signal transmission from presynaptic terminal to post synaptic terminal
    

### Cardiac Muscle

- Describe the structure of cardiac muscle cells and cardiac muscle fibres.
    
    Cardiac muscle cells also include striations
    
    Each CM cell consist of a single centrally-located nucleus
    
    CM cells are attached by intercalated discs, forming a CM fibre, which may be branched
    
    CM muscles are involved in involuntary spontaneous rhythmic contraction
    
- What are the two components of an intercalated disc between the two CM cells? ðŸ˜¢
    
    Transverse and lateral component
    
    Zonula adherens, found in transverse compartment, anchors thin filaments to cell membrane
    
    Desmosomes, found in both the transverse and lateral compartment holds cells together
    
    Gap junctions are located in the lateral compartment protected by the 2 desmosomes, allowing 2 adjacent CM cells to communicate by acting as an electrical synapse
    
- In a CM cell, where are the T-tubules located at?
    
    Invagination of sarcolemma at Z-line instead of AI junction
    
- What is the difference of SR in CM cells and SM fibres?
    
    Less extensive/elaborate, does not completely separate each myofibrils
    
    Terminal cisternae of SR is not canal shape that is parallel to T-tubule, but is very small cisternae attached to surface of T-tubule
    
    Diad structure formed instead of a triad structure
    
- Describe the cardiac conduction system.
    
    SA node generates a rhythmic impulse which spreads to the walls of both atrium
    
    Impulse transmitted to AV node, and is transmitted to walls of ventricles by AV bundles and Purkinje fibers
    
- Can repair and renewal of cardiac muscles be carried out?
    
    Adult Cardiac stem cells do not exist
    
    CM cells do not proliferate nor regenerate after foetal development
    
    After injury, the CM cells is replaced only by scar tissue
    

### Smooth muscle

- Describe the structure of a smooth muscle.
    
    Bundle or sheet of elongated taper-ended fusiform-shaped cells
    
    Each SM cell consist of a single centrally-located nucleus
    
    SM cells are interconnected by gap junction to regulate contraction
    
    Contractile apparatus (thin and thick filament) not arranged orderly to give striations
    
    Involved in involuntary contractions innervated by Automatic nervous system, initiated by a variety of impulse
    
- How does contraction occurs in smooth muscle cells?
    
    T-tubule is replaced by caveolae, small depressions on the cell membrane
    
    SR located behind caveolae has a small Ca2+ store, thus influx of extracellular Ca2+ is important to initiate contraction
    
    Thin filament of contractile apparatus are connected to dense body (attachment points) on intermediate filaments
    
    This results in a web instead of myofibrils
    
    Muscle cells squeezes in all planes, rather than shortening in one plane
    
    - How does myosin heads arrangement on thick filament differ in smooth muscle cells?
        
        Myosin heads on opposite sides of thick filament points to opposite directions, thus thin filaments slide against each other in oposite directions, rather than moving towards the M-line in a sarcomere
        
- How is repair and renewal of smooth muscles carried out?
    
    SM cells are able to proliferate to maintain or increase their number
    
    e.g Uterus during menstrual cycle and pregnancy
    
    They are able to divide mitotically in response to injury
