### Oxyntic glands and pyloric glands differ in cell types and secretions produced

Consider the [[The structure of the gastric pits and gastric glands varies between regions of the stomach\|The structure of the gastric pits and gastric glands varies between regions of the stomach]], i.e. in oxyntic glands and pyloric glands.

Oxyntic glands consist mainly of 3 cell types:

- Mucous neck cells - involved in secreting alkali mucus ([[Surface mucous cells and neck mucous cells are involved in the maintenance of a two-layered mucous gel layer\|Surface mucous cells and neck mucous cells are involved in the maintenance of a two-layered mucous gel layer]])
- Parietal (oxyntic) cells - involved in secreting hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factors
- Chief (zymogenic) cells - involved in secreting pepsinogen (and the insignificant gastric lipase)

**The oxyntic glands secrete mainly mucus, hydrochloric acid, intrinsic factors and pepsinogen.**

The oxyntic glands also consist of other cell types:

1. Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells - responsible for releasing histamine (stimulates acid secretion)
2. D cells - responsible for releasing somatostatin (inhibits acid, gastrin and histamine secretion as a negative feedback)
3. X cells - responsible for releasing ghrelin (stimulates acid secretion)

**Pyloric glands secrete mainly mucus and gastrin.**
