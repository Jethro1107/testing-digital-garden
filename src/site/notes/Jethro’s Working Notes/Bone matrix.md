### Bone matrix

Bone matrix is a mixed matrix consisting of organic matrix (osteoid) synthesized by [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoblast\|Osteoblast]]s and inorganic matrix that is formed from the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biomineralization of bone\|Biomineralization of bone]], also regulated by [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoblast\|Osteoblast]]s.

    The organic matrix consist of 90% *****************type 1 collagen,***************** which provides tensile strength to the bone matrix, but is also important in the biomineralization of bone.
    
    Glucosaminoglycans, e.g. Decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin and hyaluronan is present, but has little contributions to the mechanical functions of bone.
    
    Glycoproteins, notably, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein, are present to regulate [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biomineralization of bone\|Biomineralization of bone]].

    The inorganic matrix mainly consist of *****calcium hydroxyapatite crystals*****, acquired through the biomineralization of organic matrix.
