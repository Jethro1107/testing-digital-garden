### Definitions, classifications & overview

- What is the definition of vitamins?
    
    Vitamins - Essential, non-caloric, organic nutrient needed in very small amounts in the diet
    
- What is the definition of minerals?
    
    Minerals - Essential, non-caloric, inorganic nutrient needed in very small amounts in the diet
    
- How are vitamins classified?
    
    By their hydrophobicity, into lipid-soluble and water-soluble vitamins
    
    - What vitamins are classified as lipid-soluble vitamins?
        
        A, D, E, K
        
    - What vitamins are classified as water-soluble vitamins?
        
        Non-B-Complex, B complex
        
- What is vitamin deficiency? What are the two types of vitamin deficiency? What are they due to?
    
    Vitamin deficiency is the condition of a long-term lack of vitamins
    
    Primary deficiency is due to insufficient intake (lifestyle choices)
    
    Secondary deficiency is due to malabsorption
    
- What happens when there is abnormally high intake of vitamins?
    
    Hypervitaminosis - a condition of abnormally high levels of vitamins, which can lead to toxic symptoms
    
    Usually from high supplement intake or high intake of fortified food, but not from natural food sources
    
- How are minerals classified?
    
    By the recommended daily allowance (RDA)
    
    Macrominerals - RDA > 300mg
    
    Microminerals - RDA < 300mg
    

### Fat-soluble vitamins

- Vitamin A
    - What is vitamin A also called?
        
        Retinol
        
    - What are the functions of vitamin A?
        1. Vital for vision - maintains retina (Retinal converted to chromophore for rhodopsin)
        2. Vital for growth and health of skin and mucous membranes
        3. Aids immune system (Retinoic acid the ligand that binds to nuclear receptor retinoic acid receptor to act as a transcription factor related to immune processes)
        4. Aids normal development of teeth and skeletal tissues (Retinoic acid the ligand that binds to nuclear receptor retinoic acid receptor to act as a transcription factor for teeth and bone formation)
    - How is Vitamin A metabolised? Please draw a flow diagram.

        Dietary Vitamin A obtained in 3 forms: Retinol, Retinyl ester, or beta-carotene
        
        Retinol can be oxidised to give retinal, which is converted to 11-cis retinal, a component of rhodopsin in the retina
        
        Retinal can be further oxidised to give retinoic acid, which is converted to all-trans retinoic acid which acts as a transcription factor
        
        Retinoic acid is further oxidised and excreted
        
        Retinol can be converted to Retinyl esters for storage in liver (hepatic stellate cells)
        
        beta-carotene can be converted to retinal
        
    - What are the symptoms of Vitamin A Deficiency?
        
        [[1. Xerophthalmia (includes night [[blindness)\|1. Xerophthalmia (includes night [[blindness)]]]]
        
        1. Decreased production of rhodopsin (visual purple) → results in night blindness
        2. Keratinization of the skin (scaling skin)
        3. Weakened immune system and increased infection
    - What is the main symptoms of Hypervitaminosis A?
        - Vitamin A-induced hepatotoxicity
            
            Vitamin A is stored in hepatic stellate cells
            
            Hypervitaminosis A causes stellate cells to die, forming scar tissues
            
        - Hypervitaminosis A-induced hypercalcemia and Vitamin A-induced osteoporosis
            
            Vitamin A reduces calcium absorption via Vitamin D
            
            Excess vitamin A inhibits bone formation and promotes bone resorption by regulating osteoblast/osteoclast number
            
            This reduce bone mineral density and increases risk of bone fracture (Vitamin A-induced osteoporosis)
            
            The calcium released from bone resorption results in Hypervitaninosis A-induced hypercalcemia
            
    - Elaborate on beta-carotene and it’s relationship with vitamin A
        
        Beta-carotene is the provitamin of vitamin A
        
        It is inactive, and must be converted into active form to be useful
        
        Conversion is tightly regulated, and thus overdose of beta-carotene does not result in hypervitaminosis A
        
        However, overdose of beta-carotene results in carotenemia, resulting in orange skin
        
- Vitamin D
    - What is Vitamin D also called?
        
        Calcitriol
        
    - What are the functions of vitamin D?
        1. Promotes intestinal absorption of Ca, Mg, P
        2. Promotes reabsorption of P in kineys
        3. Maintains Ca and P reservoirs in bones, which allows for growth and remodelling of bones
        4. Stimulates cell growth
        5. Stimulates neuromuscular and immune functions
        6. Reduce inflammation
    - How is Vitamin D metabolised?
        
        Vitamin D can be synthesized by skin when exposed to sunlight
        
        7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to cholecalciferol (previtamin of Vitamin D3)
        
        Liver hydrolyze cholecalciferol into 25-hydroxycholecalciferol
        
        Kidney hdrolyze 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into Calcitriol, which is activated as a hormone
        
        Vitamin D undergoes 2 times activation by hydroxylation in the liver and in the kidneys
        
    - What kinds of people might have vitamin D deficiency?
        
        People without sunlight exposure
        
        People with malabsorption of vitamin D
        
        People with impairments with the vitamin D conversion process
        
    - What are symptoms of vitamin D deficiency?
        
        Rickets (in children)
        
        Osteomalacia/Osteoporosis (in adults)
        
        Muscle weakness
        
    - What are the main symptoms of Hypervitaminosis D?
        
        Hypercalcemia
        
        Calcinosis (Overcalcification) of bones, skeletal tissues, heart, kidneys
        
        Bone pain and kidney stones
        
        Hypertension
        
- Vitamin E
    - What is vitamin E also called?
        
        Tocopherol
        
    - What are the functions of Vitamin E?
        
        Acts as an antioxidant to protect cell membranes and proteins from damage from free radicals (reactive oxygen species) by acting as radical scavengers
        
        Absorbed and transported in lymphatic system as lipoproteins, once it enters circulation and reaches the liver, it will bind to transporters and transported to peripheral tissues
        
        They also aid the production of RBC
        
    - What kinds of people might have vitamin E deficiency?
        
        Very rare, but found in people with impaired lipid metabolism (abetalipoproteinemia)
        
    - What are the symptoms of Vitamin E deficiency?
        
        Neurological dysfunction - Dysarthia, tendon reflex impairment, impaired proprioception
        
        Neuromuscular problems - Spinocerebellar ataxia, myopathies
        
        Immune impairment
        
        Haemolytic Anaemia owing to haemolysis of RBC due to oxidative damage
        
    - What are the symptoms of Hypervitaminosis E?
        
        Rare, as Vitamin E has low toxicity even at high doses
        
        Produces undesirable effects with anticoagulant medication in maintaining anticoagulant state
        
        Increased bleeding tendancies
        
- Vitamin K
    - What is Vitamin K also called?
        
        K1 - Phyloquinone
        
        K2 - Menaquinone
        
    - What are the functions of Vitamin K?
        
        Involved in post-translational carboxylation of proteins to promote blood coagulation
        
        Prevents vessel mineralisation
        
        Aids in bone metabolism
        
    - How is Vitamin K metabolised?
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Involved in the coagulation cascade, particularly the carboxylation of prothrombin precursor into active prothrombin
        
        Vitamin K Hydroquinone is oxidised into Vitamin K epoxide during carboxylation of prothrombin precursor into biologically active prothrombin, which is the active zymogen for thrombin, the coagulation factor
        
        Vitamin K epoxide is reduced into Quinone by Vitamin K epoxide reductase
        
        Quinone is reduced into Vitamin K hydroquinone by Vitamin K reductase
        
        Dietary Vitamin K usually takes the Quinone form
        
    - What kinds of people might have Vitamin K deficiency?
        
        Very rare, as generally can be obtained in adequate amounts from diet, and can even be produced from intestinal bacteria
        
    - What are the symptoms of Vitamin K deficiency?
        
        Bleeding and bruising tendancies
        
        Weaken bones, potentially result in osteoporosis
        
        Increased risk of calcification of arteries and other soft tissues
        
    - What are the symptoms of Hypervitaminosis K?
        
        No clear toxicity
        
        Synthetic form of vitamin K, Vitamin K3 (menadione) is toxic at high levels, resulting in haemolytic anemia and liver damage

    - In general, what are the functions of Vitamin B?
        
        Act as conezymes, that play a role in carbohydrate metabolism and One-Carbon metabolism
        
    - What B vitamins are involved in Carbohydrate Metabolism?
        
        B1, B2, B3, B5, B7, B12
        
    - What is the One-Carbon Metabolism?
        
        A series of interlinked pathways (Methylation cycle, Folate cycle) that process folate (B9), to provide methyl group, 1C unit to the cell for methylation of DNA or proteins
        
        Also involved in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, and certain amino acids, phospholipids and creatine
        
        Within the folate cycle, dietary folate, or folic acid can be converted to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
        
        5-methyltetrafolate can transfer its methyl group to homocysteine in the Methylation cycle to give Methionine under the action of methionine synthase
        
        Within the methylation cycle, methionine is adenylated into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal methyl group donor, donating the methyl group to a methyl acceptor, DNA or protein
