### Acute Inflammation - 4 Hallmarks

- What are the possible causes of tissue damage?
    
    Hypoxia
    
    Physical agent
    
    Chemical agent
    
    Biological agent
    
    Immunological reactions
    
    Others (genetic defects, nutritional imbalance)
    
- What are the possible responses of cells to stress and injurious stimulus?
    
    In response to stress, the cell tries to adapt to maintain homeostasis
    
    In presence of mild injurious stimulus, or if the cell fails to adapt, the cell undergoes irreversible injury
    
    If the injurious stimulus is strong, the cell undergoes irreversible injury and cell death
    
- What are the factors affecting the result of cell injury?
    
    Injury - Type, Duration, Severity
    
    Cell - Type, State, Adaptability
    
    e.g. Different cells have different susceptibility to ischaemic injury
    
- What are the effects of cell death?
    
    Loss of organ function
    
    Leakage of cell content into bloodstream → Detectable by blood test
    
    Infection
    
    Acute inflammation
    
    Effects of repair and regeneration - e.g. Scarring ⇒ affects function
    
    Dystrophic calcification
    
- What is inflammation? What is acute inflammation and chronic inflammation?
    
    The physiological response of an organism to tissue injury, not a disease by iteself
    
    Acute inflammation is the initial and often transient series of tissue reaction to injury.
    
    Inflammation is a response of vascularized tissues that delivers leukocytes and molecules of host defense from the circulation to the sites of infection and cell damage in order to eliminate the offending agents.
    
    Chronic inflammation is the subsequent and often prolonged tissue reaction following the initial response
    

- What are the cardinal signs of acute inflammation?
    
    Rubor - Redness
    
    Tumor - Swelling
    
    Calor - Warmth
    
    Dolor - Pain
    
    Functio laesa - Loss of function
    

### Components of Acute Inflammation

- What are the components that play a role in acute inflammation?
    
    Tissue damage
    
    Chemical Mediators
    
    Blood vessels
    
    Neutrophils
    
- What are the chronological events in acute inflammation and its relations to the cardinal signs of acute inflammation?
    
    Tissue damage ⇒ Increased blood flow (Redness and Warmth) ⇒ Leakage of plasma protein (Swelling) ⇒ Neutrophil emigration (Pain)
    

### Chemical Mediators in Acute Inflammation

- How do tissues damage initiate acute inflammation?
    
    Damaged tissues release chemical mediators to initiate the different functions in acute inflammation
    
    Chemical mediators may initiate:
    
    Vasodilation
    
    increased vascular permeability
    
    Neutrophil emigration
    
    Initiate plasma protein-derived mediators
    
- Discuss the origin and function of different cell-derived mediators.
    1. Histamine (Vasoactive)
        
        Stored in mast cells and basophils
        
        Released from mast cells by degranulation upon:
        
        1. Physical injury
        2. Binding of antibody to mast cell
        3. Initiated by the complement system
        
        Effects include:
        
        Vasodilation
        
        Increased vascular permeability
        
    2. Arachidonic acid derivatives
        
        Arachidonic acid are Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in cell membrane phospholipids, mainly various WBCs
        
        Arachidonic acid is not the mediator itself, but it is converted into prostaglandin and other inflammatory mediators de nevo during tissue injury
        
        Prostaglandins produced in tissue injury generally promote Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability
        
        Arachidonic acid is converted into Prostaglandin by cyclooxygenase COX1 and COX2
        
        Hence, COX1 and COX2 inhibitors can be used as anti-inflammatory drugs
        
        Since COX1 not only functions in inflammatory response, it is constitutively expressed, playing a role in homeostatic functions. Thus COX1 inhibitors may result in undesirable effects
        
        COX2 by contrast is only involved in inflammation, but is absent in resting conditions, hence COX2 inhibitors can be used to avoid the undesirable effects
        
    3. Cytokines
        
        Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin-1 (IL-1)
        
        Originates from macrophages
        
        Increase neutrophil adhesion to endothelium (margination)
        
    4. Chemokines
        
        Originate from macrophages
        
        Recruits neutrophils to site of tissue damage (chemotaxis)
        
    5. Nitric Oxide
        
        Originates from endothelial cells
        
        Increases vascular permeability
        
- Discuss the activation and function of plasma protein-derived mediators.
    
    Complement system:
    
    Activation of classical pathway by binding of Ab/AG complex, while activation of of alternative pathway by binding of microbe initiates Complement activation, resulting in C3 fragmentation into C3a and C3b
    
    - C3a and C5a triggers release of histamine by mast cell, thus contributing to vasodilation and increased vascular permeability
    - C5a acts as a chemotactic signal for neutrophils
    - C3b also acts as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis
    - C3b triggers C5-9 activation to form a MAC complex to contribute to cell lysis
    
    Coagulation system:
    
    Activation upon tissue damage to create a blood clot
    
    Kallikrein-kinin system:
    
    Activation upon tissue damage and involved in vasodilation and activates complement C5
    

### Vascular events in Acute Inflammation

- What are the two vascular events involved in acute inflammation?
    
    Vasodilation and Increased vascular permeability
    
- What causes vasodilation and what is the happens during vasodilation?
    
    Vasodilation is initiated by chemical mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, complements, Bradykinin etc.
    
    It involves the dilation of the blood vessels, and the opening of new capillary beds by opening of precapillary sphincter
    
    This results in increased blood flow, contributing to redness and heat of the cardinal signs of acute inflammation
    
- Compare transudate and exudate. Define exudation.
    
    Transudate is the extravascular fluid formed by increased hydrostatic pressure, characterised by low protein concentration, and only the presence of low molecular weight protein due to low permeability of the endothelium
    
    Exudate is the extravascular fluid formed by increased vascular permeability, characterised by high protein concentration and presence of larger molecular weight protein
    
    Exudation is the escape of fluid, proteins and blood cells from the vascular system into interstitial fluid
    
- What are the mechanisms of increased vascular permeability?
    
    Retraction of endothelial cells to open up intracellular junctions - Occurs in venules, induced by histamine, NO and other mediators, rapid short lived effect
    
    Endothelial injury - Occurs in all blood vessels, induced by burns, or microbial toxins, rapid and long lived effect, causing oedema
    
    Leukocyte-mediated endothelial injury - Occurs in venules and pulmonary capillaries, associated with late stage inflammation, long lived effects
    
- How does vasodilation help in inflammation?
    
    Vasodilation (increase in vessel diameter) and loss of fluid by exudation leads to slower blood flow, concentration of red cells in blood and higher viscosity of blood, resulting in dilation of such vessels, known as stasis
    
    As red cells are confined in a central axial column, neutrophils are displaced to the vascular endothelium (peripheral position), known as the process of margination, and move out of blood vessel into site of inflammation
    
- How does increased vascular permeability help in acute inflammation?
    
    It allows immunoglobin to move into damaged tissues to destroy invading microorganisms
    
    It allows coagulation proteins to move into tissue, helping blood clot formation
    

### Neutrophils in Acute Inflammation

- List the processes carried out by neutrophils in acute inflammation chronologically.
    
    Emigration into tissues (Margination, rolling, adhesion, deapedesis)
    
    Chemotaxis
    
    Phagocytosis
    
- Describe how neutrophils emigrate into tissues.
    
    Due to stasis, red cells concentrate in the central axial column, displacing the neutrophils to the peripheral regions of vessels, resulting in margination
    
    Sialyl-Lewis X-modified proteins on leukocytes adhere transiently, detach and bind again to Selectin due to disruption by blood flow on endothelium resulting in rolling along endothelium
    
    Integrin on leukocytes are usually expressed in low affinity state, but chemokines produced at site of injury stimulate activation  of integrin to high-affinity state
    
    Integrin binds firmly to integrin ligand (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM-1) on endothelial cells, resulting in adhesion
    
    Neutrophil then migrates through endothelium in a process called diapedesis
    
- Describe how neutrophils move to site of injury.
    
    Chemotaxis - Locomotion oriented along a concentration gradient of chemoattractant
    
    Chemoattractant involves:
    
    Bacterial products (exogenous)
    
    Cytokines, particularly chemokines (endogenous)
    
    Complements, particularly C5a (endogenous)
    
    Leukotrienes (endogenous)
    
    Neutrophils recognise the concentration gradient of chemoattractants, as they move up the concentration gradient to the source of these chemoattracts, i.e. the site of injury by amoeboid movement
    
- What are the two main opsonins for phagocytosis?
    
    C3b and Fc region of Ab
    
- Describe the process of opsonization by Ab and phagocytosis.
    
    Ab binds to Ag to form Ab/Ag complex to opsonize the pathogen
    
    Fc receptors of phagocyte binds to Fc region of antibody
    
    Pseudopodia formed engulf the microbe to form a phagosome
    
    Phagosome fuses to lysosome to digest the microbe
    
- Describe the oxygen dependent mechanisms in killing and degradation of microbe in phagocytosis.
    
    It involves forming reactive oxygen species
    
    Oxidase oxidizes NADPH and reduces O2 into superoxide anion O2-, which is converted to hydrogen peroxide, which then reacts with chloride ion to give hypochlorite ion
    
    Superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite ion are all microbicidal
    

### Outcomes of Inflammation

- What are the possible outcomes of inflammation?
    
    Systemic effects:
    
    Fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, Leucocytosis
    
    Occurs when cytokines and prostaglandins spill into systemic circulation
    
    Resolution - Usual result of inflammation
    
    Suppuration - Occurs with excessive exudate
    
    Repair and organization resulting in fibrosis - Occurs when there is excessive necrosis
    
    Chronic inflammation - If there is persistence of causal agents
    
- What are the beneficial and harmful effects of acute inflammation?
    
    Beneficial effects:
    
    Demolition of invading microorganisms
    
    Deliver oxygen, nutrients and drugs (antibiotics) to site of infection
    
    Harmful effects:
    
    Destroy normal tissue
    
    Swelling and oedema can be harmful in certain anatomic sites, e.g. Epiglotis (Obstructs airway), Cerebrum (Brain herniation)
    

### Clinical Significance of Acute Inflammation

- How does lymphatics play a role in acute inflammation?
    
    Lymphatics will help drain oedema fluid that accumulates due to increased vascular permeability
    
    Lymphatics (Lymphangitis) and Lymph nodes (Lymphadentitis) may be secondary inflamed
    
    Red streaks near skin wound are telltale signs of infection
