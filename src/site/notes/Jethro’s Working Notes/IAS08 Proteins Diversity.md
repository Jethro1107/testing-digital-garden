    Fibrous proteins have long extended repetitive sequences that enable structural roles
    
    Globular proteins are entirely soluble in aqueous environment
    
    Collagen has a triple helix structure
    
- **Structure of Collagen**

    (a) - single left-handed alpha helix
    
    (c) - three left-handed alpha helix form a right handed triple-helix (super helix)
    
    The repetitive sequence of collagen- Glycine-proline-hydroxyprolineπ

    Collagens assemble into fibrils, a supermolecular structure
    
    Striations due to evenly-spaced interactions between collagen molecules, where heads of collagen molecules come together in a repetitive fashion to form striated patterns

    Vitamin C, a redycing agent keeps Fe2+ reduced to sustain prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, allowing the synthesis of hydroxyproline, resulting in the synthesis of collagen
    
- **Structure of Keratin**
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-09-08 at 2.25.45 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-09-08 at 2.25.45 PM.png]]
    
    Keratin includes two alpha helices (coiled coil)
    
    alpha helix ⇒ coiled coil ⇒ protofilament ⇒ protofibril ⇒ intermediate filament
    
    disulphide bond stabilises keratin

## Oxygen-Binding Proteins

- **Leaning Outcomes**
    
    To illustrate the interplay between haemoglobin and myoglobin in oxygen transport
    
    To explain cooperativity in ligand binding, exemplifying by haemoglobin function and carbon monoxide poisoning
    
- **Structure of Haem and oxygen binding mechanism**
    
    ![[8844D275-CCF8-4687-B655-C9A7F9BCF893.jpeg\|8844D275-CCF8-4687-B655-C9A7F9BCF893.jpeg]]
    
    ![[AE9B794D-C95A-4017-81DE-8597EBA1C032.jpeg\|AE9B794D-C95A-4017-81DE-8597EBA1C032.jpeg]]
    
    Haem consist of a porphyrin ring (planar), with two histidine on either side of the plane
    
    Distal histidine stabilizes oxygen in position
    
    ![[968600D4-C0F8-422D-9D26-F143505B3F0F.jpeg\|968600D4-C0F8-422D-9D26-F143505B3F0F.jpeg]]

- **Myoglobin vs Haemoglobin**
    
    ![[83857B79-D97B-420D-B52A-3A3E6A2AF2F1.jpeg\|83857B79-D97B-420D-B52A-3A3E6A2AF2F1.jpeg]]
    
- **Positive cooperativity**
    
    ![[AFE03A6E-A4F1-46CA-B4D4-215D9D09E677.jpeg\|AFE03A6E-A4F1-46CA-B4D4-215D9D09E677.jpeg]]
    
    ![[27F70118-6EFF-4362-8D58-F438CC367484.jpeg\|27F70118-6EFF-4362-8D58-F438CC367484.jpeg]]
    
    When the first ligand binds to the binding site of a subunit, it results in the structural change of the other subunits, where the new conformation has a higher affinity to oxygen
    
    ![[2D32CF79-A17C-4DBD-8B4B-904BA9C59382.jpeg\|2D32CF79-A17C-4DBD-8B4B-904BA9C59382.jpeg]]
    
    T-state - low affinity to oxygen (bind loosely)
    
    As more oxygen binds to T-state haemoglobin, it changes to R-state
    
    R-state - high affinity to oxygen (bind strongly)
    
    ![[6048039D-5566-4817-BDBA-AF0F0F20C018.jpeg\|6048039D-5566-4817-BDBA-AF0F0F20C018.jpeg]]
    
    PO2 - partial pressure of oxygen (proportional to concentration)
    
    Similar to concentration gradient, O2 diffuses DOWN he partial pressure gradient
    
    Theta - saturation of haemoglobin
    
    Disadvantage for remaining in high affinity state (R-state):
    
    Unable to release O2 to tissues, even in low PO2
    
    Disadvantage for remaining in low affinity state (T-state):
    
    Only half of haemoglobin pick up oxygen
    
    Positive cooperativity allows for the sigmoid curve:
    
    Strong binding in high PO2, weak binding in low PO2
    
- **Carbon monoxide poisoning and its effects on haemoglobin cooperativity**
    
    ![[3DCC6557-982B-4AF3-8C55-37B85C86CEE1.jpeg\|3DCC6557-982B-4AF3-8C55-37B85C86CEE1.jpeg]]
    
    ![[D5715463-3A08-4060-85BF-69733CEAC69D.jpeg\|D5715463-3A08-4060-85BF-69733CEAC69D.jpeg]]
    
    Carbon monoxide:
    
    1. takes up haem otherwise for oxygen (oxygen carrying capacity similar to anemic individual)
    2. Disrupts positive cooperativity, locking it in R-state (high affinity), prevents the release of O2 in tissues
    
    Referring to curve, the loss of haemoglobin cooperativity is the killing factor
    

## Protein Folding and Disease

- **Learning Outccomes**
    
    To understand that proteins can fold into alternative conformations
    
    To describe how protein misfolding and aggregation associate with disease
    
- **Process of Protein Folding**
    
    ![[37185DAE-8596-47E7-9229-CDB63C5DE099.jpeg\|37185DAE-8596-47E7-9229-CDB63C5DE099.jpeg]]
    
    Protein fold through progressive stabilisation of intermediates, goes through a protein folding funnel, determined by the amino acid sequence
    
    Maybe form first alpha helix, beta sheet
    
    ![[140A55BD-ABAE-4F6F-88C9-8DEF1C6282B4.jpeg\|140A55BD-ABAE-4F6F-88C9-8DEF1C6282B4.jpeg]]
    
    Chaperones (protein complexes that fold protein) generally require ATP to fold proteins
    
    ![[003B832C-AF69-4D57-A39A-34DAC25742B3.jpeg\|003B832C-AF69-4D57-A39A-34DAC25742B3.jpeg]]
    
    Some proteins exist in multiple conformations
    
- **Diseases involving misfolding proteins**
    
    ![[51D45BDC-4511-4D5E-AEAF-40DD7D8A8066.jpeg\|51D45BDC-4511-4D5E-AEAF-40DD7D8A8066.jpeg]]

    Filaments formed from assembly is toxic to the brain, causing Alzheimers
