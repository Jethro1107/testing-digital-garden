### Gastric motor functions

[[Interstitial cells of Cajal generate slow potentials and spike potentials that mediate gastric motor functions\|Interstitial cells of Cajal generate slow potentials and spike potentials that mediate gastric motor functions]].

### Gastric motor functions in the fast state

In the fast state, the stomach has a cyclic contractile activity that last 90-120 minutes, the migrating motor complex.

Phase 1 - Slow waves do not generate contraction, there is little contractile activity and last 60 minutes

Phase 2 - Random intermittent contractions, lasting 20-30% of cycle

Phase 3 - Regular high amplitude contractions occurs at a rate of 3 contractions per minute.

### Gastric motor functions in the fed state

The motor functions of the stomach in the fed state are 3 fold:

- [[Receptive relaxation of the stomach enables the stomach to function as a food reservoir\|Receptive relaxation of the stomach enables the stomach to function as a food reservoir]] - For the storage of ingested food (a food reservoir) until the food is processed in the stomach, duodenum and lower intestinal tract.
- [[Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme\|Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme]] - For the mixing of food with [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastric secretions\|Gastric secretions]], and breaking down of food into small particles, until it forms a semifluid liquid called *****chyme*****.
- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastric emptying\|Gastric emptying]] - The slow, controlled release of gastric contents (******chyme******) into the duodenum, at a rate that is suitable for digestion and absorption in the small intestine.
