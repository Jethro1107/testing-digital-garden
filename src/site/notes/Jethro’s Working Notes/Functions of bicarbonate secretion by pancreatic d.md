### Functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells

There are 5 functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells:

1. Bicarbonate secretions neutralises the acidic chyme released by the stomach.
2. Bicarbonate secretions neutralises the acidic contents of pancreatic acinar cells ([[Secretory vesicles in pancreatic acinar cells are highly acidified\|Secretory vesicles in pancreatic acinar cells are highly acidified]]).
3. Bicarbonate secretions serve as a driving force to drive movement of enzyme secretions along the ductal system.
4. Bicarbonate secretions prevent the accumulation/ precipitation of proteins in the pancreatic duct.
5. Bicarbonate secretions provide a suitable pH for pancreatic enzymes to function.
