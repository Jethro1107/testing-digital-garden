### Genu valgum and genu varum predispose to osteoarthritis of the knee

Genu valgum (Knock knee) causes localisation of large amounts of stress to the lateral tibiofemoral compartment.

Genu varum (Bow knee) causes localisation of large amounts of stress to the medial tibiofemoral compartment, which predisposes OA of the medial tibiofemoral compartment of the knee.
