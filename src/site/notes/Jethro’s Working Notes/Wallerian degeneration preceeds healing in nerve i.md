### Wallerian degeneration preceeds healing in nerve injury with axon discontinuity

In classes of nerve injury with axon discontinuity (axonotmesis and neurotmesis in [[Seddon and Sunderland classification of nerve injury\|Seddon and Sunderland classification of nerve injury]]), **Wallerian degeneration** preceeds healing.

- **************************************The steps in detail**************************************
    
    After a nerve injury with axon discontinuity, Wallerian degeneration of the nerve distal to injury occurs. Macrophages come in the phagocytose and clear the cell debris.

    Healing then proceeds:
    
    - Schwann cells proliferate and regenerate the myelin tunnel.
    - Axon sprouts and finds its way through the tunnel, at a speed of roughly 1mm per day.

    With good apposition, full recovery is expected.
    
    But with poor apposition, a disorganised nodule of axon sprouts, a traumatic neuroma will be formed.
