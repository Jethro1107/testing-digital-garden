    - **Examples of volatile acids**
        - CO2
    - **Response of bicarbonate buffer system to production of nonvolatile acids**
        - Increased nonvolatile acid production is buffered by HCO3-, producing carbonic acid
        - Conversion of carbonic acid to carbon dioxide and water is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase
        - Carbon dioxide and water is excreted
    - **Response of bicarbonate buffer system to production of volatile acids**
        - Increased volatile acid (CO2) production, causes shifting of equilibrium position
        - CO2 combines with H2O to give H+ and HCO3-, which is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase
        - Hence, plasma HCO3- levels increase and pH decreases
    - **Compare strong acids and weak acids**
        - Strong acids undergo complete dissociation, while weak acids undergo partial dissociation
- Dissociation of acids
    - Dissociation constant
        - Calculation and significance of dissociation constant

            - Dissociation constant shows the tendency of a weak acid to donate to a proton to the solution
            - The greater the dissociation constant, the greater the tendancy of a weak acid to donate a proton to the solution
        - Relations of dissociation constant with pKa
            - pKa represents the negative log of Ka
- Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation of a weak acid
    - Deriving the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation of a weak acid
        - The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation of a weak acid is derived by converting the formula for deriving the dissociation constant into a logarithmic equation
        - Note that pKa refers to the pH where a weak acid is 50% dissociated
    - Effects of pH microenvironment on extent of dissociation of a weak acid
        - When pH = pKa, the weak acid is 50% dissociated
        - When pH < pKa, less than half of the weak acid is dissociated
        - When pH > pKa, more than half of the weak acid molecules are dissociated
    - Significance of the HHE
        - The equation can be used to calculate the ratio of unprotonated to the protonated form at any pH, given that the pKa of the acid is known

    - **What are buffer systems?**
        
        Systems that can defend blood pH to a limited extent
        
    
    - **Buffer systems that defend blood pH and their location of action**
        - Chemical buffers
            - Bicarbonate buffer - important in ECF
            - Protein buffers - Important in ICF
            - Phosphate buffers - important in ICF
        - Respiratory system
        - Renal system
    - Bicarbonate buffer system
        - **Reaction in the bicarbonate buffer system**
            - CO2 reacts with H2O to give carbonic acid under the action of carbonic anhydrase, which dissociates into H+ and HCO3-
            - 
            - The forward reaction is called the hydration reaction, while the backward reaction is the dehydration reaction
        - **Response of bicarbonate buffer system to changes of pH**
            - When a base is added, H+ is removed and H2CO3 dissociates to give more H+, and dissolved CO2 reacts with H2O to replenish H2CO3
            - When an acid is added, H+ is added and is buffered by HCO3-, giving rise to H2CO3, which is converted to CO2
        - **HHE of the bicarbonate buffer system**
            - 
        - **Why might the bicarbonate buffer system be thought as ineffective? Why is this view wrong?**
            - The bicarbonate buffer system may be thought as ineffective due to a pKa of 6.1, which is far from desired plasma pH of 7.4
            - However, it works as it is an open system, where components of the system i.e. CO2 and HCO3- can be added or removed via the respiratory system and kidney system

### Action of blood buffers

- **Forms of CO2 in the body**
    - Gaseous CO2
    - Dissolved CO2 - CO2, H2CO3, HCO3-, CO3 2- and carbamino compounds
    - CO3 2- is neglected because the pKa of bicarbonate is 9.8, such that only trace amount
    - Carbamino compounds are also neglected as they are excluded from the bicarbonate buffer system
- **Maintaining acid base balance in a cell**
    - Source of H+ in a cell
        
        Dissociation of metabolic acids, such as acetylacetic acids and beta-hydroxybutyric acid from beta oxidation of fatty acids, or lactic acids from anaerobic glycolysis
        
        Proton entry into the cell down the proton gradient, facilitated by the negative potential
        
    - Preventing acidification of a cell
        
        Removal of H+ via Na+ H+ exchange pump
        
        Diffusion of CO2 produced out of the cell
        
    - Preventing alkalination of a cell
        
        Shuttling HCO3- out of the cell via bicarbonate shift, counterbalanced by the chloride shift into the cells
        
    - Intracellular buffers
        
        Phosphate buffers and protein buffers help resist changes in pH
        
- Transporting of blood gases between tissues and lungs in relations to blood buffers
    - **Transporting of CO2 from tissues to red blood cells in capillaries**
        - CO2 produced by tissues diffuses into erythrocytes, and immediately reacts with H2O to give H2CO3 due to the presence of carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells
        - As intracellular pH of 7 is greater than the pKa, H2CO3 dissociates to give H+ and HCO3-
        - H+ liberated is buffered by phosphate and haemoglobin
        - HCO3- is shuttled out the RBC via bicarbonate shift, counteracted by the chloride shift, such that HCO3- is relatively high in plasma to buffer blood pH
    - **Transport of O2 from red blood cells in capillaries to tissues**
        - Bohr's effect - Dissociation of carbonic acid to liberate H+, where H+ decreases affinity of Hb to O2, allowing further unloading of O2 into tissues
    - **Transport of CO2 from red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries to lungs**
        - CO2 diffuses from red blood cells into the lungs, such that the equilibrium position is reversed, H2CO3 is converted back to CO2 and H2O via carbonic anhydrase, and H+ combines with HCO3- to regenerate H2CO3
    - **Transport of O2 from red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries to lungs**
        - O2 diffuses down its pressure gradient into erythrocytes, causing an increase in erythrocyte PO2
        - The increase in PO2 decreases affinity of H+ to haemoglobin, such that H+ is released from Hb for oxygen binding
        - Haldane's effect - Release of H+ causes equilibrium position to shift, such that more CO2 is formed and diffused into the blood
