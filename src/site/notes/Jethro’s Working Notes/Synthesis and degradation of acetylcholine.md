### Synthesis and degradation of acetylcholine

****************************************************Synthesis of acetylcholine****************************************************

In the presynaptic terminal, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) catalyses the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh) from acetyl-CoA and Choline (Ch).

********************************************************Degradation of acetylcholine********************************************************

At the synaptic cleft near postsynaptic terminal, ACh is broken down into acetate and choline by acetylcholine esterase (AChE).

Choline is returned to the presynaptic terminal and reused for the synthesis of acetylcholine.
