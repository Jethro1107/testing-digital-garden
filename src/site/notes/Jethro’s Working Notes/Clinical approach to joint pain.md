### Clinical approach to joint pain

One of the key presentation of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pathology of the joint\|Pathology of the joint]] is joint pain. Thus, we have to be able to be equipped with the right clinical approach to joint pain to first build up a differential diagnosis during history taking and physical examination, and narrow down the differential diagnosis with investigations and radiological studies.

### History of joint pain

In most joint pathologies, the chief complaint would be joint pain. We must be able to take a good history of chief complaint (i.e. history of joint pain).

The following questions are important.

- **************************************************Number of joints affected**************************************************
    
    Different number of joints affected usually favours different joint pathologies:
    
    Monoarthritis (1 joint) - Often indicative of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]], septic arthritis, spondyloarthritis would be rare.
    
    Oligoarthritis (2-4 joints) - Often indicative of Spondyloarthritis, [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rheumatoid arthritis\|Rheumatoid arthritis]] and other systemic autoimmune diseases
    
    Polyarthritis (≥ 5 joints) - Often indicative of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rheumatoid arthritis\|Rheumatoid arthritis]] and other systemic autoimmune disease

- ****************************************************Symmetry of joint symptoms****************************************************
    
    Symmetrical involvement of joints is quite indicative of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic autoimmune disease and psoriatic arthritis.
    
    Assymmetrical involvement of joints is indicative of other spondyloarthritis.

- ****************************************************************************Types of joint affected (Site of pain)****************************************************************************
    
    Certain joints are associated with specific joint pathologies:
    
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rheumatoid arthritis\|Rheumatoid arthritis]] is associated with the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Carpometalcarpal joint of the thumb\|Carpometalcarpal joint of the thumb]], proximal interphalangeal joints of the digits, wrist joint.
    - [[Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)\|Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)]]]] is associated with the knee joint, hip joint, and distal interphalangeal joint (Herberden’s node).
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]] is associated with the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint.
- ********************************Back involvement********************************
    
    Back involvement is indicative of spondylitis.
    
- ********Is the joint pain acute or chronic? What is the temporal involvement of joint pain?********
    
    Acute joint pain is caused by [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Crystal arthritis\|Crystal arthritis]], Septic arthritis, Reactive arthritis.
    
    - Acute, episodic joint pain is usually [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Crystal arthritis\|Crystal arthritis]], whereas the others are just one off events.
    
    Chronic joint pain is caused by Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, various spondyloarthritis and systemic autoimmune diseases.
    
    - If chronic joint pain is progressive in nature, it is likely to be [[Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)\|Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)]]]].
    - If joint pain waxes and wanes, it is likely to be [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rheumatoid arthritis\|Rheumatoid arthritis]], or systemic autoimmune disease.
- ****************************************************************************************************Was there an associated event prior to joint pain?****************************************************************************************************
    
    Prick injury by fish may indicate septic arthritis by *********************mycobacterium marium.*********************
    
    Prior genitourinary infection may indicate reactive arthritis.
    
- ********************************************************************************************Is there any extra-articular features?********************************************************************************************
    
    Gouty tophi may indicate chronic tophaceous [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]].
    
    Plaque psoriasis and nail dystrophy may indicate psoriatic arthritis.
    

### Physical examination for joint pain

Physical examination for joint pain is important for distinguishing between inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint disorders, by determining whether there is effusion or synovitis.

Hallmarks of effusion include:

- Soft tissue swelling
- Redness
- Warmth

### Investigations for joint pain

A number of investigations for joint pains can be performed depending on the history. These include:

- Complete blood count - Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis is reveals the inflammatory nature
- C-reactive protein, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Elevation reveals inflammation, where as normal levels may be useful for confirming non-inflammatory causes like [[Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)\|Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)]]]].
- RFT and LFT
- Serum uric acid levels - Used when suspect [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]]
- Serological studies (ANA, RF, ACPA) - Used when suspect Systemic lupus erythromatus, Rheumatoid arthritis or any systemic autoimmune diseases
- Urinalysis

### Radiological studies for joint pain

Joint X Rays (Plain radiographs) are the mainstay.

Ultrasound can be used to detect synovitis, effusion and periarticular erosions.

CT and MRI are rarely use for investigating joint pain.

### Synovial fluid analysis for joint pain

Joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) for synovial fluid analysis can differentiate between non-inflammatory, haemorrhagic, inflammatory and septic types of synovial fluids. *But practically, synvoial fluid analysis for is only performed when suspecting [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Crystal arthritis\|Crystal arthritis]] or septic arthritis ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Infective arthritis\|Infective arthritis]]).*

Synovial fluid is analysed in 4 ways:

- Gross appearance - The colour, viscosity and turbidity is noted.
    
    Viscosity decreases and turbidity increases is indicative of inflammatory arthritis, and even septic arthritis.
    
- White cell count and differentials (Number of white cells and proportion of neutrophils)
    
    White cell count of greater of 2000/mm3 defines the effusion as inflammatory, where further increase in white cell count and the proportion of neutrophils increases the likelihood of septic arthritis.
    
- Crystal analysis - Polarized microscopy
    
    It is used to differentiate between the 2 types of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Crystal arthritis\|Crystal arthritis]]:
    
    - Uric acid crystals in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]] is negatively birefringent
    - Calcium pyrophosphate crystals in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pseudogout\|Pseudogout]] is positively birefringent
- Microbiological studies
    - Gram stains
    - Cultures
    - Special stains are used when suspect gonococcal infections, mycobacterial infections and fungal infections.
