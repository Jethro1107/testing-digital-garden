### Isotonic and isometric muscle contractions

Isotonic contraction involves a change in muscle length, while isometric contraction does not involve a change in muscle length.

Isotonic contraction is further classified as:

- Concentric contraction (Shortening of muscle), occurs when the tension generated is able to lift the load
- Eccentric contraction (lengthening of muscle), occurs when the tension generated is unable to lift the load
