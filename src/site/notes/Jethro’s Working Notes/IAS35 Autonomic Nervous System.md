Created: January 10, 2022 8:22 PM
Updated: September 14, 2022 1:05 PM

### Organization of the Nervous System

- 
- How is the nervous system divided anatomically?
    
    Central nervous system - Brain and spinal cord, including the optic nerve
    
    Peripheral nervous system - Nerves and nerve ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord
    
- How is the nervous system divided functionally?
    
    Somatic nervous system and Autonomic nervous system
    
- What is the difference in function between the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system?
    
    Somatic nervous system - Involves in voluntary, conscious control of the body, providing innervations to the skeletal muscles
    
    autonomic nervous system - Involves in involuntary control of the body, providing innervations to viscera, smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, glands of the body
    
- Compare the organization of motor neruons in the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.
    
    Autonomic nervous system usually consists of 2 neurons instead of 1 neuron in the somatic nervous system in the motor compartment
    
    In the somatic nervous system, the upper motor neurons in the motor cortex controls the lower motor neurons, which directly innerverate the skeletal muscles
    
    In the Autonomic nervous system, the visceral motor neurons in the hypothalamus controls the preganglionic neurons, which synapse with the ganglionic neuron at the autonomic ganglia, which then innerverates the visceral effectors

- What are the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system? What are their functions?
    
    Sympathetic division:
    
    - Kicks in during exertion, stress or emergency
    - Prepares the body for flight or fight response
    - Stimulates tissue metabolism and increase alertness
    
    Parasympathetic division:
    
    - Predominates under resting condition
    - For rest and digest activities
    - Conserve energy and promotes sedentary activities

### Sympathetic Nervous System

- Describe the general organization of the sympathetic division.
    
    Preganglionic neurons are located between segments T1 and L2 of the spinal cord
    
    Preganglionic neurons have short axons running along the short preganglionic nerve that form synapses with ganglionic neuron at the autonomic sympathetic ganglia
    
    Ganglionic neurons have long axons that run along the long ganglionic fibres that innerverates the visceral effectors
    
    Preganglionic fibers are relatively short and postganglionic fibers are relatively long as the ganglia are located near the spinal cord
    
- What are the different types of ganglia in the sympathetic nervous system.
    
    Sympathetic chain ganglia - A chain of ganglia that runs along both sides of the spinal chord
    
    Collateral ganglia - Includes the celiac ganglion, superior mesenteric ganglion and inferior mesenteric ganglion, in which postganglionic fibre from it innervate the visceral organs in the abdominalpelvic cavity
    
    Adrenal medulla - secrets neurotransmitters into circulation
    
    Ref: [[Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology  Collateral ganglia\|Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology  Collateral ganglia]] 
    
- Draw and diagram and explain the organization of neurons in the within the grey matter of spinal cord.

    Sensory nuclei is located in the dorsal horn and the motor nuclei is located in the ventral horn
    
- Explain where the preganglionic cell bodies are located and how its axons reach the the sympathetic chain of ganglia. Then, further elaborate on the different sites of ganglia in the sympathetic pathways and its functions.
    
    Preganglionic neuron cell bodies are located in the lateral gray horn of the spinal cord, in which its axon enters the ventral root. Preganglionic sympathetic fibres then access the white ramus communicantes and reach the sympathetic chain ganglia
    
    Preganglionic neuron may synapse with ganglionic neuron at the sympathetic chain ganglia, where the ganglionic fibres leave via grey ramus communicantes:
    
    In the right sympathetic chain, the postganglionic fibers from the sympathetic chain ganglia innervates the visceral effectors of the skin (sweat glands, smooth muscles etc.)
    
    In the left sympathetic chain, the postganglionic fibers/sympathetic nerves from the sympathetic chain ganglia innervates the visceral organs in the thoracic cavity
    
    If the preganglionic neuron does not form synapse with ganglionic neuron within the sympathetic chain ganglia, its axon further run along to the collateral ganglia, where it may form synapse with the ganglionic neuron, which innerverates the visceral organs within the abdominopelvic cavity
    
    If the preganglionic neuron does not form synapse at collateral ganglia, its axon would further run along to the adrenal medulla, to secrete neurotransmitters into general circulation
    
- What are the neurotransmitters that mediate neurotransmission between preganglionic neurons and ganglionic neurons within the sympathetic nervous system?
    
    Acetylcholine
    
    Hence, the synapse is cholinergic
    
- What are the neurotransmitters that mediate neurotransmission between ganglionic neurons and the target organs within the sympathetic nervous system?
    
    Norepinepherine and Epinepherine
    
    Hence, synapses are adrenergic
    
- Describe the formation of sympathetic Varicosities.
    
    The postganglionic fiber forms a branching network, consisting of varicosities covering the target organ
    
    Varicosities contain neurotransmitter vesicles
    
- Describe the synthesis and release of NE and Epinephrine.
    
    Tyrosine → Dopa → Dopamine → NE → Epinephrine
    
    Release is similar to the release of of Acetylcholine
    
    An action potential arrives at the synaptic cleft, causing depolarization and hence the opening of a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel
    
    Influx of calcium ions stimulate the release of NE and epinephrine by exocytosis
    
- What are the different types of andrenergic receptors?
    
    alpha1 (most common), alpha2 and beta receptors
    
    They are all GPCRs
    
- Describe the mechanism of signal transduction in alpha1 receptors.
    
    Binding of neurotransmitter to alpha1 receptor results in a GDP to GTP switch in the alpha subunit of Gq protein, causing its activation
    
    Activated Gq protein splits into alpha subunit and beta-gamma subunit
    
    Alpha subunit activates phospholipase C (PLC), which breaks down phosphotidyinositol-4,5-P2 (PIP2) into Inisitol-1,4,5-P3 (IP3) and Diacylglycerol (DAG)
    
    IP3 stimulates the release of of Ca2+ from ER, causing an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels
    
    Increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels stimulate Protein Kinase C to rise to plasma membrane and bind to DAG, as it becomes activated
    
    Activated Protein Kinase C phosphorylates downstream target proteins

- Describe the mechanism of signal transduction of alpha2 and beta receptors.
    
    For alpha2, binding of norepinepherine to alpha2 receptors cause the activation of Gi (inhibitory G protein), which inhibits adenyl cyclase. cAMP levels remain low, such that protein kinase A is not activated
    
    For beta receptors, binding of norepinepherine to beta receptors causes activation of Gs (stimulatory G protein), which activates adenyl cyclase, increasing cAMP levels for Protein Kinase A activation

### Parasympathetic Nervous System

- Describe the general organization of the parasympathetic division.
    
    Cell bodies of parasympathetic preganglionic neurons is located within the brain stem and the Sacral segment (S2-S4) of the the spinal cord
    
    The preganglionic neuron consists of a long axon that runs along the preganglionic fibre that synapses with the ganglionic neuron within the automatic parasympathetic ganglia
    
    The ganglionic neuron consist of a short axon that runs along the postganglionic fibre that innervates the target organs
    
    The preganglionic fibre is relatively shorter and the postganglionic fibre is relatively longer as the automatic parasympathetic ganglia is closer to the target organs
    
- What are the neurotransmitters that mediate neurotransmission between preganglionic neurons and ganglionic neurons within the parasympathetic nervous system nervous system?
    
    Acetylcholine
    
- What are the neurotransmitters that mediate neurotransmission between ganglionic neurons and target organs within the parasympathetic nervous system?
    
    Acetylcholine
    
- What are the different cholinergic receptors in target organs and their effects?
    
    Nicotinic cholinergic receptors (present in Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions):
    
    Ligand-gated Na channels
    
    Short lived excitation
    
    Muscarinic receptors (Present in parasympathetic divisions only):
    
    GPCRs in which G-proteins act on ion channels
    
    Long termed effects
    
    Can be excitatory or inhibitory
