### Peyer’s Patch

Peyer’s patches are lymphoid organs that can be found in the lamina propria of the ileum (but can extend into the submucosa), offering an integrated immunological barrier.

- **Cell types in Peyer’s Patch**
    
    Immune cells - lymphocytes mainly
    
    M (microfold) cells:
    
    - M cells overlie lymphoid nodules by forming a pocket via a deeply invaginated basolateral membrane
    - They are involved in transepithelial transport of particles (e.g. antigens) and microorganisms to immune cells in the lymphoid nodules
