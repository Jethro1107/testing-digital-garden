### Importance in Medicine - Wound Healing

- List 4 processes required for wound healing.
    
    Replace damaged tissues with new ones
    
    Formation of new blood vessels
    
    Reconnect nerves
    
    Prevent infection
    
- How can biological processes, like the repair program exemplified in wound healing, be achieved?
    
    Cells must be able to follow instructions
    
- How is the healing process a programmed response?
    
    Multiple phases - any phase will not begin unless the previous one is properly complete
    

### Simple Model

- What is cell signalling?
    
    A regulatory cell sends out signals to trigger the target cell to perform a biological task
    
    All cells can be regulatory cells and target cells
    
- What are the signals referring to?
    
    Often physical entities (molecules), some are able to cross the membrane, some are unable to do so without the help of transporters, while some are unable to cross the membrane definitely
    
- What is signal transduction?
    
    The process of detecting extracellular signal, and translate the information into intracellular signals that result in specific intracellular biochemical events
    
- What is intracellular signalling?
    
    The process of integrating the information of each signal (acquiring an impression of the biological context) and to make an appropriate response
    
- Describe a simple model of cell signal.
    
    Regulatory cell produces an extracellular signal, which switches on a molecular switch in a target cell, allowing a reaction to proceed.
    
    This allows for the production of a cellular response
    
- What is the molecular switch?
    
    A protein (enzyme/ion channel) that has cue recognition ability, and can activate a reaction
    
- What are the limitations to this simple model?
    1. The cellular response may be an aggregate of multiple reactions, thus multiple switches are required
    2. If one cue is already capable of activating the response, then the model is only capable of processing only one cue, but reality is, multiple biological information (cues) must be judged to allow a cellular response to occur

### Advanced Model

- What are the advantages of having multiple switches in contrast to one switch?
    
    Allow for multiple reactions to be coordinated, as 1 cue for 1 reaction
    
    Allows for adjustability of strength of cellular response by controlling the output of one biological reaction mediated by one of the switches
    
- Should all the switches be controlled by the same signal?
    
    No - Each reaction would thus be independent and cannot be coordinated
    
- Cascade of switches allows for reactions to be interdependent, allowing for coordination. What are the two types of switches?
    
    Main switch (the receptor) - controlled by extracellular signal
    
    Other switches (downstream of the cascade) that are controlled by the main switch either directly or indirectly
    
- How can a switch integrate information? Draw a diagram to illustrate.
    
    A molecular switch may integrate information from 2 cues as it only activates when 2 switches from 2 different paths activate

- How can integration of information account for adjustability of cellular response strength?
    
    Since a switch can integrate information from multiple cues, variations in strength of different cues will affect the overall strength of cellular response
    

### How Molecular Switches Work

- What is the main switch?
    
    Often a multifunctional protein
    
    Receptor - Binds to signal with high specificity
    
    Catalyst - It may be an enzyme itself, binding to receptor activates enzyme
    
- Give an example of a main switch. Describe why it can function as a main switch.
    
    Tyrosine kinase receptor - Extracellular domain binds to extracellular signal, intracellular domain has tyrosine kinase activity
    
    Receptors are widely apart before binding to extracellular signal and have low tyrosine kinase activity (off state)
    
    Upon binding of extracellular signal to the receptor, it allows for dimerisation of two receptors, enabling cross-phosphorylation
    
    Receptor becomes active in phosphorylated state (on state)
    
    The receptor is able to interact with downstream switches
    
- How do other non-main switches function?
    
    Non-main switches are usually enzyme that switch to the active state by phosphorylation under action of protein kinases
    
    Some enzymes may require multiple times of phosphorylation, in which the sequence of phosphorylation may affect outcome

### Role of ATP

- Why is ATP used as the phosphorylating molecule?
    
    Most switches are on in the phosphorylated state, but they are more stable in the unphosphorylated state
    
    A molecule with high phosphorylation potential is required to readily transfer a phosphate group to the switch to switch it to the on state
    
    ATP is such molecule that fits the role
    
- Why must interchange between on and off state be quantitative?
    
    This allows for amplitude activation instead of all-or-none type activation
    
    The intensity of cellular response will be determined by the on-to-off ratio of the switch, which can depend on strength of 2 opposing signals
    

### Signal Transduction - Production of intracellular signals

- Describe the process of signal transduction by tyrosine kinase receptor.
    
    Upon activation of tyrosine kinase by dimerization and cross-phosphorylation, Phospholipase C (PLC), a downstream switch in the cytoplasm is recruited to the phosphorylated receptor dimer on the inner cell surface
    
    PLC acts on Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is already present on inner surface of plasma membrane, breaking PIP2 down into inisitol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which act as the intracellular signals
    
- What are the functions of the intracellular signals produced by tyrosine kinase receptor
    
    Inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate triggers the replease of Ca2+ by SR to to trigger downstream switches (protein kinases)
    
    DAG directly activates downstream switches (protein kinase)
    
- Describe the process of signal transduction by G-protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR).
    
    When a hormone binds to a specific GPCR, a hormone receptor complex is formed
    
    The hormone receptor complex associates with GDP-associated G-protein, GDP is replaced by GTP, thus activating the G-protein i.e. GTP associated G-protein is active, while GDP-associated G-protein is inactive
    
    Activated G-protein activates adenylate cyclase, converting ATP into cAMP, which is an intracellular signal, activating certain downstream switches known as cAMP-dependent protein kinases
    
    When hormone dissociates from the receptor, GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, and G-protein becomes inactivated, causing adenyl cyclase to become inactivated as well
    
- What are second messengers?
    
    Intracellular signals, cAMP, Ins-1,4,5-P3 and DAG mediate the effects of the extracellular cues
