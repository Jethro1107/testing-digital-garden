### Atherosclerosis

- **Definition of atherosclerosis**
    
    Atherosclerosis - A condition which is characterised by an intimal lesion called an atheroma (atherosclerotic or atheromatous plaque) that impinges on the vascular wall and can rupture to cause sudden occlusion
    
    Ref: [[Robbins  Definition of atherosclerosis\|Robbins  Definition of atherosclerosis]] 
    
- Morphology of atherosclerosis
    - **Histological features of atherosclerosis**
        
        Deposition of atheromatous material in the intimal layer of the vessel, extending into the media
        
        The atheromatous plaque has an overlying fibrous cap (not lined with endothelium) which makes it pro-coagulant

    - **Morphological progression in development of atherosclerosis**
        
        Fatty streaks → Atheromatous plaques
        
        Fatty streaks - Yellow, elongated lesions that are mainly composed of foam cells
        
        Atheromatous plaque - Lesions with cells, such as VSMC, T cells, foam cells, ECM, with collagen, elastic fibre, proteoglycans, and intracellular and extracellular lipids

- **Risk factors of atherosclerosis**
    
    Unmodifiable risk factors - Age, gender, genetics
    
    Modifiable risk factors - Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, homocysteine
    
- Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
    - **Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis due to hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia)**
        
        Endothelial injury due to shear stress as a result of hypertension enables entry of LDL to enter intima
        
        ApoB of LDL reacts with matrix, resulting in oxidised LDL by ROS in vessel wall
        
        HDL is responsible for converting oxidised LDL into minimally oxidised LDL

        Oxidised LDL stimulates endothelial dysfunction, resulting in increased monocyte and leukocyte adhesion

        Monocytes penetrate the endothelial wall, proliferate and differentiate into macrophages
        
        Macrophages phagocytose oxidised LDL, forming foam cells, thus forming fatty streaks

        Foam cells undergo apoptosis and necrosis, releasing lipids and debris, thus stimulating phagocytosis
        
        Under action of growth factors released by inflammatory cells, such as platelet-derived growth factor), TGF-alpha and fibroblast growth factor, VSMC proliferate and synthesize ECM matrix, forming a fibrous cap that encloses the necrotic lipid core
        
        Homocysteine can also stimulate VSMC proliferation, but is normally kept low due to conversion into methionine in the kidneys
        
    - **Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis due to diabetes mellitus**
        
        Hyperglycemia results in glycation of collagen in vessels, forming advanced glycation endproducts (AGE)
        
        AGE is recognised by macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis
        
        Macrophages also phagocytose LDL, forming foam cells

    - **Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis due to infection**
        
        Endotoxins released by bacteria cause endothelial damage, enabling entry of LDL to trigger atherosclerosis
        
        Cytokines from sytemic inflammation may trigger coagulation and endothelial damage
        
- **Changes of an atherosclerotic plaque**
    
    Atherosclerotic stenosis:
    
    Progression of atheroma impinges on small arteries, which impeds oxygenated blood flow, resulting in ischaemia injury
    
    Acute plaque change:
    
    Plaque erosion or rupture exposes thrombogenic plaque constituents, triggering thrombosis
    
    Plaque rupture may also result in plaque hemorrhage, increasing in its volume
    
    Theses changes can result in sudden partial or complete vascular occlusion, resulting in ischaemic injury and infarction

### Disruption of circulation

- Thrombosis
    - **Definition of thrombosis**
        
        Thrombosis - A pathological condition characterised by formation of blood clot in uninjured vasculature or after relatively minor injury
        
    - **Activation of coagulation cascade**
        
        Intrinsic pathway:
        
        Negatively-charged phospholipid surface of activated platelets in the platelet plug results in activation of Factor XII, which in turn activates factor XI
        
        Factor XI activates Factor IX, which complexes with factor VIIIa in the presence PF3 and Ca2+
        
        The XIa-VIIIa complex activates factor X
        
        Extrinsic pathway:
        
        Damaged endothelial cells release tissue factor/TF (Factor III), which activates Factor VII
        
        VIIa activates factor X
        
        VIIa also activates factor IX, thus establishing a positive feedback loop to speed up the intrinsic pathway
        
        Common pathway:
        
        Xa complexes with factor V in the presence PF3 and Ca2+
        
        Xa-Va complex forms the prothrombin activator, converting prothrombin into thrombin (Factor II), which converts polymerizes fibrinogen into fibrin
        
        Thrombin (Factor II) also activates fibrin stabilizer (factor XIII), which causes cross-linking of fibrin to form fibrin net

    - **Pathogenesis of thrombus**
        
        Primary abnormalities tht leads to intravascular thrombosis are endothelial injury, abnormal blood flow and hypercoagulability (the so-called Virchow triad)
        
        - Endothelial injury
        - Abnormal blood flow
        - Hypercoagulability
    - Propagation of thrombus
    - **Fate of thrombus**
        - Propagation
            
            Thrombus propagates proximally by accretion of fibrin and thrombus, increasing likelyhood of vascular occlusion and emboli formation
            
        - Embolization
            
            Thrombus dislodges and transported elsewhere in the vasculature
            
        - Dissolution
            
            Normal clot retraction and fibrinolysis occurs
            
        - Organization and recanalization
            
            Reorganization and recanalization of the thrombus to establish continuity of the original lumen, and is eventually incorporated into the walls of the vessel
            
- Emboli
    - **Definition of embolus**
        
        An embolus is a detached intravascular solid, liquid or gaseous mass that is carried by the blood from its point of origin to a distant site, where it often cause tissue dysfunction or infarction
        
    - **Types of emboli**
        - Pulmonary thromboembolism
            - **Pathogenesis of pulmonary thromboembolism**
                
                Embolism derived from thrombosis in deep veins of the lower limbs lodges in the pulmonary arterial vasculature
                
            - **Predisposing factors of pulmonary thromboembolism**
                
                Dehydration, prolonged immobility
                
        - Fat embolism
            - **Pathogenesis of fat embolism**
                
                Damage to adipose tissues, long bones fractures cause release of fat globules into vasculature, forming a fat emboli
                
        - Marrow embolism
            - **Pathogenesis of marrow embolism**
                
                Fractures of long bones/ribs during CPR, results in release of bone marrow into vasculature, forming a marrow emboli
                
        - Air embolism
            - **Pathogenesis of air embolism**
                
                Associated with ‘high pressure’ activities, e.g. scuba divers, compression chamber workers
                
                Gases are dissolved at high pressures, where sudden pressure allows the gases to liberate as gas bubbles in the vasculature, forming air emboli
                
        - Amniotic fluid embolism
            - **Pathogenesis of amniotic fluid embolism and mortality**
                
                Infusion of amniotic fluid into maternal circulation during induced labour/tear in placenteal membrane and rupture of uterine vein)
                
                Fetal squamous cells in amniotic fluid results in an anaphylatic type reaction that results in systemic intravascular coagulopathy and hypovolemic shock
                
    - Effects of emboli
        
        Depends on location and extent of occlusion
        
        Depends on availability of collateral blood supply
        
        - **Determinants in type of infarct caused by occlusion**
            
            White/pale infarct - receives one blood supply which is occluded
            
            Red/haemorrhagic infarct - receives collacteral blood supply, in which occlusion in some branches resulted in infarction. Continuous blood supply enables bleeding into the infarct
