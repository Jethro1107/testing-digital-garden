### Glycine mutations underlie the pathogenesis of type II Osteogenesis Imperfecta

Type II Osteogenesis Imperfecta is caused by glycine mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. In glycine mutations, there is a replacement of glycine with a larger amino acid (almost always true as glycine is the smallest amino acids).

Glycine mutations serves as a kink for helical folding from C-terminal to N-terminal, allowing for more time for post-translational modification, resulting in excessive post-translational modification, which disrupts helical stability.

    When the mutant chains are incorportated into a collagen molecule, it results in an overall abnormal collagen molecule as it disrupts helical stability.
    
    This results in altered collagen packing and disrupted fibril cross-links, which destablises the collagen fibrils.
