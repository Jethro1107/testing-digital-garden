### Gastric secretions

Anatomically, the stomach is classified into 4 regions: The cardia, fundus, body and pylorus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the stomach\|Anatomy of the stomach]]). However, **physiologically, the stomach is classified into the 2 regions:**

- Oxyntic glands (found in the fundus and the body)
- Pyloric glands (found in the pylorus)
- [[Oxyntic glands and pyloric glands differ in cell types and secretions produced\|Oxyntic glands and pyloric glands differ in cell types and secretions produced]].

### Gastric acid secretion

- Neuroendocrine control of gastric acid secretion
