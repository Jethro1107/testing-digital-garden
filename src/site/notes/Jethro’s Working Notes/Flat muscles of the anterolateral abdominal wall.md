### Flat muscles of anterolateral abdominal wall

The three flat muscles of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterolateral abdominal wall\|Anterolateral abdominal wall]]  are situated laterally, stacked on top of each other, proceeding from superficial to deep: External Oblique, Internal Oblique and Transversus Abdominis.

- **External Oblique**
    - The most superficial and largest flat muscle of the abdominal wall on either side of the midline.
    - It originates from the 5th to 12th rib, and inserts onto the iliac crest.
    - It’s fibres run inferomedially, where it form an aponeurosis which merges linea alba in front of the rectus abdominis

- **Internal Oblique**
    - The middle layer, and is much smaller and thinner than the external obliques
    - It’s fibres run superomedially, where it forms an aponeurosis near the midline which merges with the linea alba

- **Transversus abdominis**
    - The deepest layer of the 3 flat muscles of the abdominal wall.
    - It has a long line of origin, it originates from the costal margins of 6th-12th ribs, the thoracolumbar fascia, the medial aspect of the iliac crest, and inferiorly arises from a thickening of the iliopsoas fascia.
    - Its fibres run transversely and forms an aponeurosis which merges with the linea alba.
    - Deep to the transversus abdominis is the transversus fascia (the investing (deep) fascia of the transversus adominis).
