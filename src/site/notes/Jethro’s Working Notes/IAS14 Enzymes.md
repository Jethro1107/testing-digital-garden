### Enzymes and the Process of Neurotransmission

- What is neurotransmission?
    
    Neurotransmission is the process by which an electrical message or the impulse travels from one neuron to another
    
    Neurotransmission can only occur with the continuous synthesis and degradation of Acetylcholine (ACh)
    
- How is synthesis of Acetylcholine achieved?
    
    Enzyme Choline Acetyl-CoA transferase (ChAT) must be present
    
- How is degradation of Acetylcholine achieved?
    
    Enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) must be present
    
- Outline the process of neurotransmission
    
    At the synaptic knob of the presynaptic cell, Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and Acetyl-CoA by ChAT
    
    ACh is released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis and binds to Cholineric receptor on the postsynaptic cell
    
    ACh is rapidly broken down by AChE
    
    Choline is transported back into the presynaptic cell by cotransport with Na+
    
    Recycled Choline is used to make more ACh
    
- How does the process of neurotransmission show the importance of enzymes?
    
    Enzymes allows the following to be specified:
    
    - Site of Occurrence
        
        Synthesis and degradation of ACh must not occur within the same cell
        
        Locations of enzymes specify the site of occurrence of a biochemical reaction
        
    - Rate of reaction
        
        Activity of enzyme can affect the rate of reaction
        
    - Reaction time
        
        Enzymes can switch between active and inactive state to switch on and switch off a biochemical reaction
        

### Enzymes and Specification of a Biochemical Reaction

- How can the site of reaction be specified?
    
    Biochemical reactions can only occur in the presence of enzymes, thus specifying the site of reaction
    
    Reactions can occur intracellular or extracellular, in selected cell types/ extracellular compartments, or anywhere
    
- How can the time of reaction be specified?
    
    Enzymes can switch between the active state and inactive state, thus determining whether the biochemical reaction occurs
    
- How can the rate of reaction be specified?
    
    Amount of active enzymes determine the rate of reaction
    
    - Draw and Explain the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme dependence of biochemical reaction
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Rate = S(Vmax)/(Km+S)
        
        S - Concentration of Substrate
        
        Vmax - Maximum rate of reaction for given amount of active enzymes, denoted by plateau of the hyperbolic curve
        
        Km - tendancy of formation of enzyme substrate complex, the affinity of the enzyme to the substrate 
        

### Chemical Environment and Enzymes

- What is chemical environment?
    
    Chemical environment is the chemical properties provided by a physical environment
    
    A reaction can only occur in an appropriate chemical environment
    
    - Where is the chemical environment located?
        
        In the catalytic site/active site of the enzyme
        
    - Why is the chemical environment of the enzyme important?
        
        To increase the rate of reaction by catalysis and specify the outcome of reaction
        
    - How does chemical environment affect specify the outcome of the reaction?
        
        The chemical environment of an enzyme provides the specific environment for the required product to be produced
        
        The chemical environment must be restrictive rather than permissive, such that the reaction yields only one product instead of more than one product
        
    - How does chemical environment specify the rate of the reaction?
        
        Chemical groups are present in the catalytic sites to lower the activation energy of the reaction (Catalysis)
        
        Different chemical groups have different mechanisms of catalysis, e.g covalent catalysis, acid-base catalysis, divalent cation catalysis
        
- How does mechanical straining play a role in enzymatic reactions?
    - Increasing the rate of reaction
        
        Mechanical straining may lower the activation energy of the reaction
        
    - Specifying the action of enzymes
        
        Enzymes strain molecules into different molecular conformation
        
        Only molecules that fit the active site in the strained state can undergo the reaction
        

### States of Enzymes

- How do enzymes affect the timing and rate of reaction?
    
    By switching between the active state and inactive state
    
- How does an enzyme become active or inactive?
    
    By changing the accessibility of the active site by structural changes of the active site
    
- What are the covalent modification of enzymes?
    - Phosphorylation/Dephosphorylation
        
        Phosphate group covalently added to (Protein Kinase) or removed from (Protein Phosphatase) surface amino acids with hydroxyl group in side chains (serine, threonine, tyrosin)
        
        Enzyme may be active in phosphorylated state or unphosphorylated state
        
        The process is fast and reversible
        
    - Cleavage of peptide bonds
        
        Cleavage of specific peptide bonds by protease alters 3D conformation
        
        Process is fast, but irreversible
        
- What are the non-covalent modification of enzymes?
    
    Activator and Inhibitors may play a role in altering the state of enzyme
    
    They bind to regulatory site
    
- Draw the Michealis-Menton model showing curves for enzymes in both active and inactive state

- What is oligomeric enzymes?
    
    Oligomeric enzymes are enzymes with multiple polypeptides with multiple catalytic sites, thus one enzyme can bind to several substrate molecules
    
    They show cooperativity interaction - Binding of a substrate to the active site of a subunit will result in a higher affinity of other subunits to substrates
    
    Substrate acts as regulators for the oligomeric enzyme
    
    - Draw the Michealis-Menton model showing curves for activity of an oligomeric enzyme
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - How do allosteric regulators affect the activity of an oligomeric enzyme?
        
        Positive allosteric regulators change enzymes to the active state, making it sensitive to low substrate concentrations ⇒ Curve is more sigmoidal
        
        Negative allosteric regulators change the enzyme to the inactive state, making the enzyme only sensitive to high substrate concentration ⇒ Curve is less sigmoidal
        
        - Draw the Michealis-Menton Curves showing the effects of allosteric regulators on oligomeric enzymes
