True positive, false positive, true negative and false negative

### PPV vs NPV

Positive predictive value (given positive, probability of disease) = TP/TP + FP

Negative predictive value (give negative, probability of no disease) = TN/TN + FN

### Sensitivity vs specificity

Sensitivity (True positive rate) - ability to identify disease = TP/TP + FN

Specificity (True negative rate) - ability to identify no disease = TN/TN + FP

### A high sensitivity test has good negative predictive values

The threshold for positive result shifts to the left to avoid false negatives, i.e. number of false negative greatly decrease. Hence, negative predictive values decrease.

### A high specificity test has good positive predictive values

The threshold for positive result shifts to the right to avoid false positives. i.e. number of false positive decrease. Hence, true positive predictive values decrease

### False positive rate & True positive rate

False positive rate = 1 - Specificity

True positive rate = Sensitivity
