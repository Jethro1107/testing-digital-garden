### Healing
Healing is the *body’s replacement of damaged tissue by living tissue, either by regeneration or repair* (Walter and Israel 1987).

Regeneration is the replacement of lost tissue with similar tissue type, through proliferation of the undamaged differentiated parenchymal cells.

Repair is the replacement of of lost tissue with granulation tissue, which then matures into scar tissue.

In principle, there are [[Jethro’s Working Notes/4 phases of healing\|4 phases of healing]].
