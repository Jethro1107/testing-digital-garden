### Enzymes involved in ECM turnover

MMPs are the key enzyme for ECM turnover:

- They cleave specific sites of ECM proteins, and are classified into collagenase, gelatinase and stromolysin by the ECM protein it cleaves.
- There is a high degree of regulation of MMPs, by:
    - Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs)
    - MMPs are secreted as proenzymes, that require cleavage of prodomain during its activation.

Other enzymes also participate in ECM turnover:

- Hyaluronidase and chondroitinase
- Serine protease, elastase and cathepsin (less specific)
