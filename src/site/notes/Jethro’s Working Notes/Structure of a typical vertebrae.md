### Structure of a typical vertebrae

A typical vertebrae consist of a vertebral body, a vertebral arch, and the 7 processes.

- ****************************Vertebral body****************************
    
    Vertebral body is the large, anterior, roughly cylindrical bone.
    
    Size of vertebral bodies increase as we move down the vertebral column, as each bears progressively greater body weight.
    
- ****************************Vertebral arch****************************
    
    The vertebral arch is formed by 2 pedicles and 2 laminae, posterior of the vertebral body.
    
    The 2 pedicles are short cylindrical processes that project posteriorly to meet the laminae, where the 2 laminae are broad flat bones that project posteromedially to meet at the midline.

    The posterior surface of the vertebral body and the vertebral arch encloses the vertebral foramen, where successions of vertebral foramen forms the vertebral canal (spinal canal), which houses the spinal cord, nerve roots, meninges, fats and blod vessels. 
    
- **************************************************************************************************************************************************Lateral view of the vertebral column reveals the intervertebral foramina**************************************************************************************************************************************************
    
    The intervertebral foramina is formed by the intervertebral disc, superior and inferior vertebral notches. 
    
    The intervertebral foramina houses the nerve roots and spinal ganglia.
    
    The relative inferior position of the intervertebral foramina and the numerically corresponding vertebral levels underlies the difference in the communication of ***********************vertebral levels and spinal levels***********************.

- ******************************************************************************************************************************7 processes provide surface for muscle attachment and articulation of intervertebral disc******************************************************************************************************************************
    
    The spinous process, which projects posteriorly (and usually inferiorly) from the junction of the laminae.
    
    The 2 transverse process, which projects posterolaterally, from the junction of the pedicles and laminae.
    
    The 2 superior articular processes and 2 inferior articular processes, which project superiorly and inferiorly from the junction of the pedicles and laminae respectively. They bear articular facet.
