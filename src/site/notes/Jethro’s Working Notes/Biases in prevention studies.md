### Biases in prevention studies

Biases in prevention studies, particularly studies revolving around the effectiveness of [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Screening\|Screening]] may reveal an improvement in survival or mortality, that may exagerate the effectiveness of prevention/screening. The 3 biases include: lead-time bias, length time bias and Volenteer bias.

- ****************************Lead-time bias****************************
    
    Lead-time bias is the perceived increase in survival time merely due to earlier detection of the disease.
    
    This is avoided by using mortality as an outcome measure rather than survival time.
    
- ********************************Length-time bias********************************
    
    Length-time bias is the perceived increase in survival time because screening programs tend to pick up more slowly progressive disease (which have longer survival), that aggressive forms of disease (which have less survival), a selection bias, if you will.

    This is avoided by comparing outcomes in randomised control trials.
    
- ****************************Volunteer bias****************************
    
    Volunteer bias is a classical confounder in prevention studies.
    
    Volunteer biases involves confounders such as health awareness and socioeconomic status, which impact screening (the exposure) and is associated with reduced morbidity or mortality (the outcome).
    
    This is avoided by comparing outcomes of randomised control trials.
