### Lung interstitium and difuse interstitial lung disease

- **What is diffuse interstitial lung disease?**
    
    Diffuse interstitial lung disease refers to a heterogenous group of diseases that is associated with pathological pulmonary interstitium diffusely, caused by known or unknown cause
    
- Classification of diffuse interstitial lung disease

### Acute Interstitial lung disease

- Acute mild interstitial lung disease
    - **Example of acute mild interstitial lung disease**
        
        Interstitial pneumonitis, e.g. viral infection
        
    - **Pathology of acute mild interstitial lung disease**
        
        Mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates in the pulmonary interstitium
        
- Acute severe interstitial lung disease
    - **Example of acute severe interstitial lung disease**
        
        Diffuse alveolar damage (Histological manifestation of ARDS)
        
    - **Eitiology of acute severe interstitial lung disease**
        
        Lung injuries:
        
        Common - viral pneumonitis (influenza, SARS-CoV2, MERS, SARS)
        
        Uncommon - Gastric aspiration, toxic fume inhalation, drowning etc.
        
        Systemic injuries:
        
        Common -  sepsis, shock, severe trauma
        
        Uncommon - acute pancreatitis, post-lung transplant, drug overdose etc.
        
    - **Pathogenesis of diffuse alveolar damage**
        
        In ARDS, the integrity of the alveolocapillary membrane is compromised by epithelial and endothelial damage
        
        Epithelial cell injury is detected by alveolar macrophages, which release inflammatory factors (IL-1, TNF-alpha, IL-8) for endothelial activation and recruitment of neutrophils
        
        Activated neutrophils enter interstitium and alveoli, releasing destructive products (ROS, protease) that damage the epithelium and endothelium
        
        Fibrin rich exudates entering alveoli and necrotic epithelial cells reorganize into hyaline membrane
        
        Type II pneumocytes proliferate to line the alveolar wall
        
    - **Pathology of diffuse alveolar damage**
        
        Hyaline membrane consisting of fibrinous exudates and necrotic debris
        
        Interstitial and alveolar oedema, with mononuclear infiltrates and neutrohils
        
        Alveolar collapse due to surfactant insufficiency and increased surface tension
        
        Extravastation of red blood cells
        
        Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia
        
    - **Pathophysiology of diffuse alveolar damage**
        
        Diffusion impairments - due to hyaline membrane
        
        Reduced lung volume and lung compliance - due to surfactant insufficiency
        
        VQ mismatching - due to uneven epithelial and endothelial damage
        
    - **Clinical features of diffuse alveolar damage**
        
        Histological manifestation of Acute respiratory distress syndrome
        
        Acute type 1 respiratory failure - severe hypoxemia with low PaCO2
        
        CXR - ‘white out’, ‘snow storm’
        
    - **Prognosis of diffuse alveolar damage**
        
        30-60% mortality
        
        Surviving patients would have diffuse pulmonary fibrosis
        

### Chronic Interstitial lung disease

- **What is chronic interstitial lung disease?**
    
    Chronic interstitial lung disease refers to a heterogenous group of disorders that cause diffuse injury and chronic inflammation of the lung interstitium, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the lung interstitium, with pulmonary function studies indicative of restrictive lung disease
    
    Cf: [[Robbins  Chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease\|Robbins  Chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease]] 
    
- **Classification of chronic interstitial lung disease by etiology**
    
    Classified into chronic interstitial lung disease of unkown etiology and chronic interstitial lung disease of known etiology
    
    Unknown etiology:
    
    - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
        - **Pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**
            
            Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is caused by repeated injury of unknown causes, resulting in chronic interstitial inflammation
            
            Release of pro-fibrogenic factors (e.g. TGF-beta) results in chemotaxis, proliferation into interstitium and collagen deposition by fibroblasts
            
            Dense fibrosis cause collapse (amputation) of alveolar walls and formation of cystic space lined by hyperplastic Type II pneumocytes or bronchiolar epithelium
            
        - **Histopathology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**
            
            Interstitial fibrosis, thickened alveolar wall
            
            Obiteration of some air spaces
            
            Cystic dilitation of some air spaces (lined by bronchiolar epithelium)
            
            Chronic interstitial inflammation with mainly mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (mainly lymphocytes)
            
        - **Gross pathology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis**
            
            Rigid, shrunken lung showing restrictive patterns
            
            Fibrosis
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            End-stage changes: 
            
            Honeycomb lung, with cystic dilitation surrounded by fibrous tissue and areas of collapsed airspaces
            
            Pleural surface has a bubbly texture, where the protrusions consist of cystic airspaces, while the depressions are made of fibrous tissue and collapsed airspaces
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
    
    Known etiology:
    
    - Pneumoconiosis (mineral dust deposition) - Silicosis, Asbestosis
        - **What is pneumoconiosis?**
            
            Pneumoconiosis refers to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis due to mineral dust deposition
            
            It is an occupational disease which is conpensable
            
        - **Pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis**
            
            Once the mineral dust is phagocytosed by the alveolar macrophages, it results in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and pro-fibrogenic mediators
            
            Pro-fibrinogenic mediators results in the chemotaxis of fibroblasts, fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition, resulting in pulmonary fibrosis
            
        - Silicosis
            - **Etiology of silicosis**
                
                Silica (SiO2)
                
            - **Risk factors of silicosis**
                
                Quarry workers involved in quartz mining, sand blasting, rock cutting, glass making and pottery
                
                Usually develops after prolonged occupational exposure (10-20 years) or after massive exposure
                
            - **Pathology of silicosis**
                
                Silicotic nodules - consist of concentrically arranged collagen fibres surrounding an ammorphous core
