### Ischaemic Heart Disease

Ischaemic heart disease is a broad term that encompasses closely related cardiac syndromes caused by myocardial ischaemia, the imbalance between coronary blood supply and myocardial demand.

### Causes of ischaemic heart disease

In 90% of cases of IHD, IHD is a consequence of reduced coronary blood supply secondary to obstructive aetherosclerotic vascular disease occuring in one of the 3 epicardial routes, hence, unless otherwise specified, ischaemic heart disease is used synonymously with coronary artery disease (CAD).

In the remaining cases, IHD is caused by:

Increased myocardial demand (e.g. Hypertrophy, hypertension)

Reduced blood volume (e.g. shock, hypotension)

Deminished oxygenation (e.g. COPD, pneumonia, chronic heart failure)

Deminished oxygen carrying capacity (CO poisoning, anemia)

### Clinical manifestations of ischaemic heart disease

Clinical manifestation may include one or more of the following cardiac syndrome:

1. Angina pectoris - Ischemia-induced chest pain but is insufficient to cause myocardial death, classified into stable and unstable angina
2. Myocardial infarction - occurs when severity or duration of ischemia is sufficient to cause myocardiocyte death
3. Chronic IHD with CHF - progressive cardiac decompensation occuring after MI or secondary to accuulation of small ischaemic insult, precipitated into heart failure
4. Sudden cardiac death - occurs as a result of tissue damage in MI, but more commonly of a lethal cardiac arrhythmia

The term acute coronary syndrome applies to any three of the catastrophic manifestation of IHD:

1. Unstable angina
2. MI (STEMI and NSTEMI)
3. SCD

### Pathogenesis of IHD

IHD is a consequence of diminished coronary perfusion relative to myocardial demand, usually a consequence of atherosclerotic occlusion of one of the three major epicardial arteries, with superimposed thrombosis, and/or vasospasm

Fixed atherosclerotic narrowings of less than 75% is assymptomatic, even in exertion

Atherosclerotic lesions that occlude more than 75% of the vessel lumen (so called ‘critical stenosis’), causes insufficent perfusion in increased demand, results in typical presentation of angina pectoris on exertion, and the patient is said to have stable angina

Atherosclerotic lesion that causes 90% stenosis can cause insufficient coronary perfusion at rest, and the patient is said to have unstable angina

Other than the severity of fixed atherosclerotic stenosis, acute plaque change is another trigger for myocardial ischaemia, causing IHD, which is often manifested as acute coronary syndrome

Acute plaque change:

Rupture, fissuring, erosion or ulceration of plaque exposes thrombogenic constituents of the plaque, triggering thrombosis

Plaque rupture may also cause plaque hemorrhage, causing volume expansion

This results in partial or complete occlusion, resulting in ischaemic injury or infarction

Acute plaque change results in unstable angina, MI and SCD, thus is a culprit of acute coronary syndrome
