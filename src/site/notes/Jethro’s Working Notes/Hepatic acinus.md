### Hepatic acinus

Hepatic acinus is a diamond shaped structure where the short axis is made of 2 portal triads, and the long axis is made of 2 central veins. It focuses on hepatic pathology, classifying the liver parenchyma into the 3 zonesâ€¦ Zone 1 surrounds the portal tract/ portal triads and Zone 3 surrounds the central vein.

Blood supply, nutrient supply and oxygen supply decrease from zone 1 to zone 3.
