[About these notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)

Andy Matuschak, the person who pioneered the idea of writing evergreen notes. I may not be familiar with his other fields of work, but in the field of *personal knowledge management*, he is someone I respect greatly. Sometimes, I go to his website and read up on *evergreen notes*.
