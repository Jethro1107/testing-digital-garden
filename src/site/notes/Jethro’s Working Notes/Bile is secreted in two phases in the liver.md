### Bile is secreted in two phases in the liver

Initial bile is secreted by hepatocytes into the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Bile cannaliculus\|Bile cannaliculus]]. Initial bile consist of large amounts of bile acid, cholesterol, bilirubin and other organic constituents. 

The initial bile is drained into the biliary tree, (i.e. it drains down the cannaliculi towards the interlobular septa to terminal bile duct, and then to progressively larger ducts, eventually reaching the hepatic duct and into the common bile duct. 

At larger ducts, the initial bile is modified by cholangiocytes (simple columnar epithelium lining the biliary system) by the secretion of HCO3-. 

- **HCO3- secretion by cholangiocytes is mediated by an ionic mechanism:**
    
    Apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (AE2) pumps out HCO3- in exchange for luminal Cl-.
    
    CFTR (cAMP activated) and TMEM16A (Ca2+ activated) facilitate the action of Cl-/HCO3- exchanger by recycling Cl-.

The resultant secretion is delivered into the gallbladder for storage.
