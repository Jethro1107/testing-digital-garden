Updated: June 18, 2022 11:20 AM

### Mechanisms of diseases

- Describe the host-microbe interaction.
    
    The microbe try to survive (attach ,invade, and evade host immune system ) and cause disease (toxin, enzymes)
    
    The host immune system tries to eliminate the microbe
    

### Classification of Medically Important Gram-positive Bacilli

- How are medically important gram-positive Bacilli classified?
    
    By their oxygen requirement for growth, and spore formation
    
    Aerobic:
    
    Spore forming:
    
    Bacillus - B. Anthracis
    
    Non spore forming:
    
    Listeria - L. monocytogenes
    
    Corynebacterium - C. Diphtheriae
    
    Anaerobic:
    
    Spore forming:
    
    Clostridium - C. perfringens, C. tetani, C. Botulinum, C. difficile
    
    Non spore forming:
    
    Lactobacillus
    
    Bifidobacterium
    

### Classification of Medically Important Cocci

- How are medically important cocci classified?
    
    Gram positive:
    
    Staphylococcus - S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus
    
    Streptococcus & Enterococcus (Classified by appearance on blood agar)
    
    Beta haemolytic (complete haemolysis, transparent zones around colonies) - S. pyogenes
    
    Alpha haemolytic (Green/partial haemolysis, green, opaque zones) -S. pneumoniae, Viridans streptococci
    
    Non-haemolytic (no notable zones surrounding colonies) - E. faecalis, Non-haemolytic streptococci are non-pathogenic
    
    Gram negative:
    
    Neisseria - N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis
    
    Moraxella - M. catarrhalis
    

### Staphylococcus Aureus

- What is the microscopic appearance of Staphylococcus in a gram stain?
    
    Gram positive cocci in clusters (purple)
    
- What is the oxygen requirement for growth of Staphylococcus?
    
    Facultative anaerobic - Can survive in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions
    
- What is a special property of S.aureus that enables selective culture of S. aureus?
    
    Salt tolerance (up to 7-10% NaCl)
    
    Mannitol salt agar can be used for selective and differential medium for S. aureus
    
    Selective - Salt can isolate S. aureus as S. aureus is salt tolerant while other bacteria aren't
    
    Differential - S. aureus oxidize manitol into an acid, hence, S. aureus colonies appear pink in acid-base indicator
    
- What biochemical test is carried out to differentiate Staphylococcus and Streptococcus?
    
    Catalase test
    
    Staphylococcus is catalase positive (produces bubbles), while streptococcus is catalase negative (no bubbles)
    
- How is Staphylococcus further classified?
    
    Coagulase - Converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which deposits on surface of S. aureus, hindering phagocytosis
    
    Coagulase positive (formation of precipitate) - S. aureus
    
    Coagulase negative (no precipitate) - S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus
    
    - Where do S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus cause infections generally?
        
        S. epidermidis adheres to prosthetic devices like implants and catheters, resulting in prosthetic infections
        
        S. saprohyticus causes cystitis (infection of the urinary bladder) in young women
        
- What is the appearance of S. aureus on culture media?
    
    Golden yellow colonies on blood agar
    
- What are the virulence factors on S. aureus?
    
    Attachment:
    
    Attachment onto cell surface by techoic acid (present on peptidoglycan of G+ bacteria)
    
    Evasion from host defence:
    
    Coagulase (Convert fibrinogen into fibrin deposited on bacteria surface â‡’ anti-phagocytic) 
    
    Catalase (Breakdown hydrogen peroxide released by WBC)
    
    Protein A (reacts with Fc of IgG, rendering IgG useless)
    
    Invasion:
    
    Enzymes - Hyaluronidase, lipase, DNase, protease, to digest through tissues
    
    Toxins (Invasion not required):
    
    Epidermolytic toxins - cause Scalded Skin Syndrome
    
    Toxic shock syndrome toxin
    
    Enterotoxins - Food poisoning
    
    Panton-Valentine Leukocidin - Dermonecrotic

    Reservoir - Humans, 30% of healthy people are nasal carriers
    
    Transmission - Direct contact
    
    Risk factors of S. aureus infection - Diabetes mellitus, Patients on hemodialysis, intravenous drug users
    
- What are common clinical diseases caused by pyogenic infections of S. aureus?
    
    Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI)

- Describe the antibiotic resistance of S. aureus in Hong Kong.
    
    Almost all S. aureus develop Penicillin resistance as they encode for penicillinase
    
    Methicillin and cloxacillin are stable to penicillinase
    
    50% of S. aureus in QM are Methicillin-resistance S. aureus (MRSA)
