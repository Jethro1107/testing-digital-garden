### Vomiting

Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of gastric contents in the stomach , aimed at eliminating noxious agents.

- **Vomiting is a reflex action mediated by the brainsteam dorsal vagal complex (vomiting centre), which consist of:**
    
    Area postrema (Chemoreceptor triggering zone) - The floor of the 4th ventricle, that lies outside the blood brain barrier. The chemoreceptor triggering zone is triggered by the Seratonin (5HT3), Dopamine (DA2), NK1 and other blood bourne emetics.
    
    Nucleus of solitary tract (NTS), particularly its medial subnucleus - Integrates signals from different centres, and modulates the vomiting reflex.
    
    Dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX) - Mediates the motor functions of the GI tract during vomiting.

    The chemoreceptor triggering zone.
    
    Brainstem vestibular nuclei in the medulla and pons, which contains H1 receptors and receives signals from the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear related to motion sickness.
    
    Higher centres, such as the cerebral cortex and limbic systems, which signals NTS via muscarinic receptors.

- ********************************************************************Vomiting is a coordinated action with 2 phases********************************************************************
    
    The podomal phase - characterised with relaxation of gastric muscles, followed by retrograde peristalsis of intestinal contents into the stomach, which is mediated by vagus nerve.
    
    The ejection phase - characterised with retching and expulsion of gastric contents.
    
    - Forced inspiratory efforts by the intercostal muscles and diaphragm, and forced expiratory efforts by muscles of abdominal wall raise the intragastric pressure, forcing out gastric contents.
    - Simutaneously, the epiglottis, glottis close, and the soft palate rises to close off the nasal cavity.
    - Hypersalivation occurs, releasing alkaline saliva to neutralize acid to protect the teeth.
