### Overview of urine production

- **Functional unit of the kidneys**
    
    Nephron - consist of renal corpuscle and renal tubules
    
    - **Two capillary beds of nephron**
        
        Glomerulus + peritubular capillaries (surrounding convoluted tubules)/vasa recta (supplies loop of Henle)
        
    
    - **2 types of nephrons**
        
        Cortical nephron (80-85%) - primarily located in the cortex, with a short loop of Henle
        
        Juxtamedullary nephron (15-20%) - renal corpuscle close to the medulla, but remains in cortex, with a long loop of Henle
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Basic function of nephrons**
        
        Nephron performs 3 basic functions:
        
        1. Glomerular filtration
        2. Tubular reabsorption
        3. Tubular secretion

### Glomerular filtration

- **Site of glomerular filtration**
    - Renal corpuscles
        
        
        - **Microanatomy of a renal corpuscle**
            
            Renal corpuscle consist of a glomerulus and the bowman’s capsule
            
        - Glomerulus
            
            
            - **What is the glomerulus?**
                
                A tuft (20-40 loops) of fenestrated capillaries surrounded by a double-layed epithelial Bowman’s capsule 
                
            - **Cells making up the glomerulus**
                
                Fenestrated endothelial cells and mesangial cells
                
                Ref: [[Junqueira’s Histology  Mesangial cell\|Junqueira’s Histology  Mesangial cell]], [[CPR39  Function of mesangial cells\|CPR39  Function of mesangial cells]]
                
        - Bowman’s capsule
            
            
            - **What is the bowman’s capsule?**
                
                Blind-ended dilated portion of the kidney tubule enclosing the bowman’s/urinary/capsular space
                
            
            - **2 layers of bowman’s capsule**
                - Parietal layer - outer layer lining outer surface of the Bowman’s capsule
                    - **Epithelial lining of the parietal layer**
                        
                        The parietal layer is lined with simple squamous epithelium supported by an external basement membrane
                        
                        At the tubular pole of the renal corpuscle, the epithelium changes to the simple cuboidal epithelium characteristic of the proximal convoluted tubule
                        
                        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                        
                - Visceral layer - inner layer lining glomerulus
                    - **Specialization of visceral epithelium of bowman’s capsule**
                        
                        The visceral epithelium is made of podocytes, a simple squamous epithelial cell
                        
                        Cell body of podocytes give rise to several projections, which give rise to smaller branches called pedicles
                        
                        The cell body do not contact the basement membrane of the capillary, but each pedicle is in direct contact with the basement membrane
                        
                        Pedicles of a podocyte interdigitate with pedicles from other podocytes
                        
                        Space between pedicles are filtration slit, where the glomerular filtrate pass through
                        
                        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                        
- Filtration barrier
    - **Components of the glomerular filtration barrier**
        
        Fenestrated endothelial cells (fenestrations around 50-100nm) of glomerular capillaries
        
        Fused basal laminae of endothelial cells and podocytes (-ve charge)
        
        Filtration slits between intercalated pedicles of podocytes (20-30nm)
        
    - Filterability of solutes
        - **2 properties of solute affecting filterability by glomerular filtration barrier**
            
            Filtered by size and charge
            
            Filterability of solute is inversely related with size, i.e. Glomerular filtration barrier is permeable to small molecules, and impermeable to large-size proteins and cells
            
            Glomerular filtration membrane is less permeable to negatively-charged proteins, as they are repelled by the negative basal laminae (i.e. while albumin is small enough to pass through the fenestrations, the glomerular filtration barrier is impermeable to albumin as it is repelled by the basal laminae)
            
            Ref: [[Guyton and Hall  Effects of size and charge on filterability of solutes\|Guyton and Hall  Effects of size and charge on filterability of solutes]]
            
        - Proteinuria/Albuminuria
            - **Cause of proteinuria and indication**
                
                Hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes melittus and inflammation of kidneys
                
            - **Pathophysiology of proteinuria**
                
                Collapse of podocytes or splitting of glomerular basement membrane, increasing permeability of low molecular weight protein
                
- Glomerular filtration rate
    - **Ultrafiltration forces determining net filtration pressure**
        
        Similar to starling’s force:
        
        - Forces favouring filtration:
            - Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (created by afferent arteriole being greater than efferent arteriole in diameter)
        - Forces opposing filtration:
            - Hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule
            - Glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure
        
        Net filtration rate (NFR) = Pc - Pbc - glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Factors affecting net filtration pressure**
        
        2 factors affect net filtration pressure, 1) afferent arteriole resistance, 2) efferent arteriole resistance
        
        1. Afferent arteriole resistance - Vasodilation of arteriole increases glomerular blood flow, increasing glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and thus increasing net filtration pressure
        2. Efferent arteriole resistance - Vasoconstriction of efferent arteriole resists outflow from glomerulus, thus raises glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and increases net filtration pressure 
        
        Ref: [[Guyton and Hall  Determinants of Glomerular Filtration rate (GFR)\|Guyton and Hall  Determinants of Glomerular Filtration rate (GFR)]] 
        
    - **Definition of glomerular filtration rate**
        
        Glomerular filtration rate - Total volume of filtrate formed by both kidneys per minute (an indication of how well the blood is filtered by kidneys)
        
    - **Determinants of glomerular filtration rate**
        - Net filtration pressure
        - Permeability of filtration membrane
        - Surface area available for filtration
        
        Ref: [[Guyton and Hall  Determinants of Glomerular Filtration rate (GFR)\|Guyton and Hall  Determinants of Glomerular Filtration rate (GFR)]], [[equation for net fluid flux\|equation for net fluid flux]]
        
    - **Normal glomerular filtration rate and thresholds for renal failure**
        
        Normal GFR: 90-140mL/min
        
        Stage 1 renal failure: 90-140/min and observable structural change observed from biopsy or protein in urine
        
        Stage 2 renal failure: 60-90ml/min
        
        Stage 3 renal failure: 30-60ml/min
        
        Stage 4 renal failure: 15-30ml/min
        
        Stage 5 renal failure: <15 ml/min (complete failure, transplant and dialysis required)
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - Relations between renal clearance and glomerular filtration rate
        - **What is renal clearance?**
            
            Renal clearance of a substance refers to the volume of blood cleared of a substance in a given amount of time
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Assumption for renal clearance to be used as GFR**
            
            If the substance is only filtered, but not reabsorbed nor secreted by the kidney, renal clearance can be used as an estimate of GFR
            
            Such a molecule is inulin (plant chemical), but is not endogenously produced in the body
            
        - **Which substance is used as a rough measurement of GFR?**
            
            Creatine urine levels is used as a rough measurement of GFR, since it is freely filtered, undergoes small amounts of secretion, and not reabsorbed, thus it slightly overestimated of GFR
            
            Levels is affected by age, gender, food intake and **muscle mass**
            

### Loop of Henle

- Microanatomy of loop of henle
    
    
    - **Epithelial lining of loop of Henle**
        
        Simple squamous epithelium with relatively fewer microvilli than PCT
        
        Nucleus bulges into the lumenal side
        
    
    - **Function of loop of Henle**
        
        Involved in reabsorption of water (urine concentration) and salts, for building up a high concentration of salt in the medullary tissue, and creation of a hypertonic gradient between collecting duct and renal interstitium
        
- Countercurrent multiplier system in creating hyperosmotic renal medullary interstitium
    - **Permeability of descending limb and ascending limb to water**
        
        Descending limb is permeable to water (due to presence of aquaporin-1) and impermeable to salt
        
        Ascending limb is permeable to salt and impermeable to water
        
    - **Channels present in ascending limb and its effect**
        
        Apical membrane:
        
        - NKCC channel - co-transports 1K+, 2Cl- with 1 Na+ from luminal side into the epithelial cell, driven by the Na+ gradient generated by the Na-K pump on basolateral membrane
        
        Basolateral membrane:
        
        - Na-K exchange pump (powered by ATP) - pumps out 3 Na+ out of epithelial cell into interstitium in exchange for 2 K+ into the cell
        - Cl- channel - allows the efflux of Cl- into medullary interstitium that is building up due to NKCC channel
        
        K+ channels are present on both membrane, such that there is no net change in K+ concentration
        
        **Overall effect - NaCl is pumped from luminal side into medullary interstitium, diluting urine and forming a hyperosmotic medullary interstitum**
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Mechanism of countercurrent multiplier system in creating the hyperosmotic renal medulla**
        
        Salt is pumped out of the ascending limb into medullary interstitium, which raises the interstitial osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient between tubular fluid in ascending limb and medullary interstitium
        
        Water leaves the descending limb by osmosis, but interstitial osmoalality remains high due to the continued pumping of salt out of ascending limb, and the absorption of water into the vasa recta, which runs in opposite direction 
        
        However, as water leaves descending limb by osmosis, osmolality of filtrate raises (i.e. urine concentrates) as we move down the descending limb
        
        In the ascending limb, salt is pumped out of of the ascending limb to further raise the interstitial osmoality, creating an osmotic gradient between tubular fluid in ascending limb and medullary interstitium

    - **Changes in osmolality of filtrate in loop of henle**
        
        Urine concentrates down the descending limb, reaches highest osmolality at bend of nephron loop, and dilutes as we move up the ascending limb

### Collecting ducts

- Microanatomy of collecting duct
    
    
    - **Epithelial lining and cell types of epithelial cells**
        
        Simple cuboidal epithelium made of lightly stained principal cells and darker stained intercalated cells
        
    - **Response of principal cells to vasopressin**
        
        Insertion of aquaporin-2, stimulating water reabsorption
        
- Controlled reabsorption of water
    - **Channels in principal cells**
        
        Basolateral membrane - Aquaporin-3 and Aquaporin-4
        
        Aquaporin-2 in vesicles, for insertion onto apical membrane
        
    
    - **Mechanisms underlying Vp-induced increased water permeability**
        
        Vp binds to V2R on basolateral membrane, which has 2 effects:
        
        1. Phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine residue at 256 position, resulting in trafficking of AQP-2 bearing vesicles to the apical membrane
        2. Depolymerization of apical actin web, facilating AQP insertion onto apical membrane
        
        Net effect - Insertion of aquaporin-2 onto the apical membrane increases the permeability of water, allowing for water reabsorption, producing an anti-diuretic effect
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Chronic increases in Vp levels also stimulate transcription of AQP2 gene, increasing AQP2 production
        
    - **Mechanism of production of diluted urine during plasma hypoosmolality**
        
        In hypo-osmolality (overhydration), no vasopressin is released to stimulate principal cells
        
        Collecting duct remains impermeable to water, thus no water reabsorption (despite hyperosmotic medulla)
        
        Urine just passed into renal pelvis
        
        This results in production of large volume of diluted urine
        
    - **Mechanism of production of concentrated urine during plasma hyperosmoality**
        
        In hyperosmolaity (dehydration), vasopressin is released to stimulate principal cells, resulting in insertion of AQP2 onto apical membrane
        
        Collecting duct becomes permeable to water, thus water is reabsorbed into the hyperosmotic medulla created by loop of henle
        
        This results in production of small volume of concentrated urine
        
- Synthesis and secretion of Vasopressin by the hypothalamo-pituitary axis
    - Hypothalamo-pituitary axis
        - **What is the hypothalamo-pituitary axis?**
            
            A description of the interaction between the hypothalamus and pituitary glands in terms of vasopressin secretion
            
            Vasopressin is synthesised in magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus, which is transported via the long axons to the axonal terminal at the posterior pituitary gland
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **How is vasopressin secreted into the circulation by pituitary gland?**
            
            When neurons in the paraventricular neurons and supraoptic neurons fire, action potential arrives at axonal terminal in the posterior pituitary glands
            
            Arrival of action potential at axonal terminal results in influx of Ca2+, leading to exocytosis of vasopressin-containing vesicles into circulation
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        
        - **Factors affecting vasopressin release by pituitary gland**
            - Osmolality of body fluids
                - **Receptors involved in sensing osmolality of body fluids and their mechanism of function**
                    
                    Osmoreceptors, a specialized mechanosensitive receptor, known as Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid (TRPV) that converts changes in osmolality into electrical signals, as it has a pore loop segment (between 5th and 6th transmembrane segment) that acts as a cation channel
                    
                    ![[40F77076-AD53-4A17-9966-2C56B104A7CB.jpeg\|40F77076-AD53-4A17-9966-2C56B104A7CB.jpeg]]
                    
                    Response to hyperosmolality:
                    
                    Plasma hyperosmolality induces cell shrinkage, which results in a confirmation change in the osmoreceptor. leading to opening of the pore loop, and increased cation conductance.
                    
                    Membrane becomes depolarized, resulting in firing of action potential
                    
                    Response to hypoosmolality:
                    
                    Plasma hypoosmolality induces water entry by osmosis, resulting in stretching of cell membrane, supressing osmoreceptor, reducing cation conductance
                    
                    Membrane becomes hyperpolarized, inhibiting firing of action potential
                    
                - **Sensitivity of Vp release to osmolality changes**
                    
                    1% deviation of osmolality can result in signifcant changes in plasma vasopressin levels
                    
                    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                    
                - **Location of osmoreceptor in the brain**
                    
                    Organum Vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), Subfornical Organ (SFO) - Circumventricular organs that lack blood-brain barrier, thus detecting plasma osmolality
                    
                    Hypothalamic Paraventricular nucleus and supraocular nucleus - detects CSF osmolality
                    
                - Summary of regulation of osmolality of body fluids
                    
                    Dehydration/hyperosmolality:
                    
                    Hyperosmolality results in cell shrinkage, resulting in conformational change in osmoreceptor, increasing cation conductance and depolarization of magnocellular neurons in paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus in hypothalamus, causing them to fire action potential
                    
                    Action potential arives at axonal terminal at posterior pituitary gland, resulting in the release of vasopressin into circulation
                    
                    Vassopressin binds to V2R on basolateral membrane of principal cells, allowing the insertion of AQP-2 into apical membrane
                    
                    The collecting duct is permeable to water, causing water reabsorption into circulation, restoring osmolality
                    
            - Blood pressure and Blood volume of vascular system
                - **Receptors involved in sensing blood pressure and blood volume of vascular system and their mechanism of function**
                    
                    Baroreceptors in carotid sinus, aortic arch and atrium of the heart
                    
                    They increase firing in response to stretch of blood vessels
                    
                - **Baroreceptor reflex pathway in controlling vasopressin release**
                    
                    Baroreceptor signals ascend via glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve to the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) of the medulla
                    
                    NTS neurons send excitatory pathway to the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM)
                    
                    CVLM neurons send inhibitory pathway to rostral ventrolatereal medulla (RVLM)
                    
                    RVLM has excitatory neurons that project to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON)

                    Relationship between vasopressin release and haemodynamic factors exhibit an exponential pattern
                    
                    The change in plasma level is observed when pressure or volume drop by more than 8 percent

                - **Response of baroreceptor reflex controlling vasopressin release in normal conditions/hypertension**
                    
                    Tonic activity of baroreceptors at normal blood pressure and increased baroreceptor signals in hypertension inhibits the exitatory pathway from RVLM to hypothalamic PVN and SON, such that no vasopressin is released from the posterior pituitary

                - **Response of baroreceptor reflex controlling vasopressin release in hypotension**
                    
                    Decreased activity of baroreceptor in hypotension decreases stimulation of NTS, and hence decreases stimulation on CVLM
                    
                    This removes inhibitory effect of CVLM on RVLM, thus causing a tonic excitatory imput into PVN and SON, resulting in VP secretion

    - Disorder related to vasopressin
        - Diabetes insipidus
            - **What is diabetes insipidus?**
                
                Diabetes insipidus is a condition in which their is an inability of kidney under physiological conditions to concentrate urine sufficiently, caused by vasopressin deficiency, or inability of the kidneys to respond to vasoressin by producing a concentrated urine
                
            - **Two types of diabetes insipidus**
                
                Central diabetes insipidus - condition where their is a defect of vasopressin production or release
                
                Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus - condition where kidney is unable to respond to vasopressin by producing a concentrated urine, caused by either a mutation in V2R (X-linked), or defect in AQP2 gene (autosomal),resulting in imapired trafficking to the plasma membrane
                
        - Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH)
            - **What is SIADH?**
                
                SIADH - condition in which kidney conserves too much water due to excess vasopressin
                
            - **Causes of SIADH**
                1. Diseased posterior pituitary, causing constant leakage of Vp
                2. Small cell lung carcinoma, tumr characterised by differentiation into neuroendocrine system and the secretion of Vp
                3. Impaired hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and anti-depressant medication history (blocked V1b receptors triggering excessive vasopressin release)
            - **Symptoms of SIADH**
                
                Excessive water retention - Weight gain, elevated blood pressure, cerebral edema
                
                Hyponatremia - muscle weakness
