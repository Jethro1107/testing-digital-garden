### Pertussis (whooping cough)

- **What is pertussis?**

- **Etiology of pertussis**
    
    Bordetella pertussis - a gram negative coccobacilli
    
    - **Virulence factors of bordetella pertussis**
        
        Attachment - Filamentous haemagglutinin, Fimbrae
        
        Toxins - Pertussis toxins (PT), Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), Tracheal cytotoxin, Dermonecrotic toxin (DNT), Pertactin (PTN)

- **Transmission of pertussis**
    
    Transmitted by respiratory droplets
    
- **Clinical manifestations of pertussis**
    
    Classical pertussis presents with 3 phases: Catarrhal stage, paroxysmal stage and covalescent stage
    
    Catarrhal stage (non-specific) - Rhinorrhea, lacrimation, conjuctival injection, low grade fever, dry cough
    
    Paroxysmal stage (specific):
    
    Hallmark symptom of pertussis - Paroxysmal cough, i.e. a series of severe, vigorous cough with little to no inspiratory efforts in between, followed by an inspiratory whoop, the forced inspiratory effort following each attack

    May result in cyanosis (hypoxemia)
    
    Postussive emesis (vomiting) often vollows the paroxysmal cough
    
    Covalescent stage - cough subsides after weeks or months
