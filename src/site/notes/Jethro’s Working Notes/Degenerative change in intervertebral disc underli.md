### Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation

As we age, an imbalance in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/ECM homeostasis\|ECM homeostasis]] in the nucleus pulposus of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intervertebral disc\|Intervertebral disc]] will result in net breakdown of hyaluronic acid-aggrecan aggregates.

This causes it to hold less water, resulting in loss in swelling pressure and compressive resistance.

Hence, upon compression, the nucleus pulposus will herniate through the annular fibrosis, which underlies disc herniation in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Compression disorders\|Compression disorders]].
