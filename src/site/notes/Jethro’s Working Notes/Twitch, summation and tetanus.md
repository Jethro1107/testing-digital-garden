### Twitch, summation and tetanus

The concept of twitch, summation and tetanus concerns the effects of frequency of stimulation and the tension production (temporal motor motor unit recruitment).

- ************Twitch************
    
    A twitch is a single muscle contraction that occurs in response to a single, rapid stimulus and a single action potential in the muscle fibres.
    
    The duration of twitch differs in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Different types of muscle fibres\|Different types of muscle fibres]].
    
    There is a latent period between stimulus and the twitch, which corresponds to the excitation-contraction coupling, the time required for action potential propagation and calcium release by sarcoplasmic reticulum.

- ******************Frequency Summation (Temporal recruitment)******************
    
    When frequency of stimulus increases, the stimulus may arrive before full relaxation occurs, such that the next contraction is partially added to the previous contraction, resulting in increase in muscle tension. Staircase phenomenon, heart rate determines inotropy is a similar concept.

- **************Tetanus**************
    
    In tetanus, the frequency in which maximal tension is reached.
    
    In unfused tetanus, stimuli is still far apart to aloow muscle to relax slightly before stimuli.
    
    In fused tetanus, frequency has reached to such a high level that the stimuli arrives before relaxation can occur.
