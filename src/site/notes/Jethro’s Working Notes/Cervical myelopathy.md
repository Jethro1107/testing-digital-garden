### Cervical myelopathy

Cervical myelopathy is a pathological process, often caused by cervical spondylosis (i.e. named Cervical spondylotic myelopathy unless it is not caused by cervical spondylosis), that results in narrowing of cervical spinal canal (cervical spinal stenosis), resulting in compression of cervical spinal cord.

- **********************************************************************Pathoanatomy of cervical myelopathy**********************************************************************
    
    Cervical myelopathy is commonly caused by cervical spondylosis, degeneration of the cervical vertebrae, that results in:
    
    - Osteophyte formation in the vertebral bodies
    - Osteophyte formation in the facet joint
    - Osteophyte formation in the uncovertebral joints
    - Intervertebral disc herniation centrally ([[Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation\|Degenerative change in intervertebral disc underlies disc herniation]])
    - Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL)
    - Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy

    The effect, narrowing of the cervical spinal canal (i.e. cervical spinal stenosis), resulting in compression of the spinal cord.
    
- ****************************************************************************Pathophysiology of cervical myelopathy****************************************************************************
    
    Cervical spinal stenosis usually results in compression of the lateral corticospinal tract (motor functions), an upper motor neuron lesion:
    
    - This results in muscle weakness of the upper limbs and the lower limbs, that results in clumsiness of the fine upper limb movement, abnormal **************spastic gait).**************
    
    It also results in compression of the dorsal root:
    
    - This results in sensory symptoms: parasthesia, numbness or sensory loss in a dermatomal fashion.
- ********************************************************************************************************Physical examination findings of cervical myelopathy********************************************************************************************************
    
    As this is an upper motor neuron lesion, it results in:
    
    - Hyperreflexia, or exagerated deep tendon reflexes, (Biceps, triceps, patella, and achilles)
    - Positive Hoffman’s sign
    - Inverted radial reflex: Extension of both wrist extension and finger flexion following tapping the brachioradialis
    - Finger escape sign: The patient is unable to hold the ulnar digits in extension and adduction.
    - Grip test: Failure to repetitive make a tight fist
- **************************************Clinical course and clinical features of cervical myelopathy**************************************
    
    There is gradual step-wise progression of neurological deficits:
    
    - There is neck, upper limb and lower limb pain
    - There is parasthesia and numbness of the upper limb and lower limb (sensory symptoms)
    - Motor signs include: Weakness in the upper limb and lower limb, which manifests as clumsiness of upper limbs with limited fine motor control, abnormal spastic gait.
    - Severe compression may result in sphincter control deficits (urinary retention and bowel sphincter abnormalities).
- ****************************************************************************Investigations for cervical myelopathy****************************************************************************
    
    Imaging is required for definitive diagnosis of cervical myelopathy:
    
    - Plain radiograph (XRay) in AP veiw, lateral view, flexion and extension view
    - MRI
