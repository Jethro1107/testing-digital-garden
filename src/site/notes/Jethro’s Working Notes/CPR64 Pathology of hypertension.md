### Epidemeology of hypertension

- **Definition of hypertension**
    
    Under the guidelines of **Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure** (JNC 7):
    
    The cutoff of hypertension is defined as sustained diastolic pressure greater than 90mmHg or sustained systolic pressure in excess of 140mmHg
    
    Under the guidelines of the **American Heart Association** (AHA):
    
    The cutoff of hypertension is defined as sustained diastolic pressure greater than 80mmHg or sustained systolic pressure in excess of 130mmHg
    
    ![[IMG_1BF6099B7EFA-1.jpeg\|IMG_1BF6099B7EFA-1.jpeg]]
    
    Yet, a single dividing line between normotension and hypertension is arbitary
    
    These cutoffs are derived from associations with increased risk of atherosclerosis and other pathological changes, and thus are used in clinical practice
    
    Ref: [[Robbins  Epidemeology of hypertension\|Robbins  Epidemeology of hypertension]] 
    
- **Reason for repeated blood pressure measurements for diagnosis of hypertension**
    
    Several factors result in high BP readings:
    
    Exercise, stress, white coat hypertension may result in high blood pressure
    

### Pathogenesis of hypertension

- Blood pressure regulation
    - **Factors regulating blood pressure**
        - Cardiac output
            
            
            - **Definition and calculation of Cardiac Output**
                - [Cardiac Output](https://www.remnote.com/doc/XciFjR6i4tmNdMsRk) refers to the minute volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle
                - [Cardiac Output](https://www.remnote.com/doc/XciFjR6i4tmNdMsRk) = heart rate (beats per minute) x stroke volume (mL per beat)
            - **Cardiac factors and non-cardiac factors affecting cardiac output**
                
                Cardiac factors:
                
                Heart rate, contractility (neural control - beta-1 adrenergic system v.s. vagal stimulation)
                
                Non cardiac factors: 
                
                Regulation of sodium homeostasis (dietary sodium, renin status, aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide) and its effect on blood volume affects venous return, preload and thus stroke volume

        - Total peripheral resistance
            
            
            - **Determinants of resistance to blood flow**
                - Hagen-Poiseuille law states that the resistance of flow in an idealised system i.e. viscous fluid in a straight rigid, cylindrical, unbranched tube) is espressed by:

                - Resistance is directly proportional to viscosity of the blood and length of the vessel, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius
                - Radius of the blood vessel is the greatest determinant of resistance
            - **Factors affecting total peripheral resistance**
                
                Balance of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators:
                
                Vasoconstrictors - Angiotensin II, catacholamines, vasopressin, leukotrienes, thromboxane, endothelin
                
                Vasodilators - Prostaglandin, NO

    - **Renal control of blood pressure**
        
        Kidneys influence total peripheral resistance and sodium balance (and thus blood volume and cardiac output) through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis
        
        Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to give angiotensinogen I, which is converted to angiotensin II by ACE in the lungs
        
        Effects of angiotensin II on blood pressure:
        
        Vasoconstriction, thus increasing TPR and blood pressure
        
        Promotes tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water (3 mechanisms), thus increasing blood volume, increasing venous return, preload and cardiac output, raising blood pressure
        
        Angiotensin II stimulates release of aldosterone, which promotes tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water in distal tubules

    - **Autonomic control of blood pressure**
        
        Sympathetic nervous system regulates blood pressure by:
        
        alpha-1 stimulation - vasoconstriction, causing increase in TPR and blood pressure
        
        beta-1 stimulation:
        
        1. Increased heart rate and contractility, causing increased cardiac output and blood pressure
        2. Renin release and activation of RAAS
- Hypertension caused by an abnormal relationship between salt and renin
    
    Hypertension can be caused by:
    
    1. Too much renin for body salt content (salt x RENIN) - On the extreme of this side of the spectrum, malignant hypertension
    2. Too much body salt for renin activity (SALT x renin) - On the extreme of this side of the spectrum, primary aldosteronism

- **Two types of hypertension and their prevelance**
    - Essential hypertension (common - 95%)
        - **Neural pathogenic mechanism of essential hypertension**
            
            Increased adrenergic drive, resulting in increased cardiac output and vasoconstriction
            
        - **Pathogenesis of essential hypertension by sodium-renin relationship**
            
            High sodium or high renin results in fluid retention
            
            Young people with mild essential hypertension is caused by a low-salt-high-renin
            
            Old people with mild essential hypertension is caused by high-salt-low-renin
            
        - Pathogenesis is multifactorial

    - Secondary hypertension (uncommon - 5%)
        - **Common pathogenic mechanisms of secondary hypertension**
            
            Renovascular hypotension:
            
            Renal artery stenosis causes decrease in glomerular blood flow and pressure, causing a decrease in GFR
            
            This results in renin release via macula densa mechanism, resulting in increased total peripheral resistance and blood volume due via angiotensin and aldosterone pathway
            
            Primary hyperaldosteronism caused by cortical adrenal adenoma:
            
            Aldosterone promotes reabsorption of Na+ and water despite low renin status
            
            This results in increased blood volume, and hence increased blood pressure
            
            Raised adrenergic drive due to phaeochromocytoma:
            
            Increased epinephrine released by phaemochromocytoma, resulting in increased adrenergic drive, resulting in increased cardiac output and total peripheral resistance
            

### Pathological changes of hypertension

- **Sites of pathological changes in hypertension**
    - Heart
        - **Pathological changes in the heart and mechanism**
            
            Left ventricular hypertrophy - caused by increased afterload, resulting in increased workload for left ventricle, and thus hypertrophy
