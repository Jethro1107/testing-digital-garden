### Congenital Malformation

- When is birth defects usually caused?
    
    Embryonic period, early in gestation
    
    When most women do not know they are pregnant
    
- What are different causes of birth defect?
    
    Birth defects are multifactorial:
    
    Genetics - 15%
    
    Environmental - 10% 
    
    Multifactorial - 20%
    
    UNKNOWN - 50-60%
    
- What are teratogens? How can teratogens be classified?
    
    Teratogens are factors that cause birth defects
    
    Classified into Drugs and Environmental agents
    
    Drugs
    
    Cigarette smoking, Caffeine, Alcohol
    
    Drugs 
    
    Environmental agents
    
    Metals - Organic Mercury, Lead (mental retardation)
    
    Infectious agents - Rubella, HIV, Herpes simplex virus
    
    Radiation
    
    Mechanical factors
    
- Give an example of a congenital malformation in implantation.
    
    Ectopic pregnancies - Caused by the abnormal implantation of the blastocyst
    
    The most common site of ectopic pregnancies is inside the uterine tube, but other sites like the mesentery is also possible
    
    Quite dangerous, as the invasive nature of the trophoblast may rupture blood vessels of the site after few weeks of development, resulting in severe haemorrhaging
    
- What are neural tube defects? What are the factors causing NTDs?
    
    Neural tube defects are one of the most common birth defects (1/1000) due to the abnormal closure of the neural tube
    
    Multifactorial in origin, involving both genetic and environmental factors
    
- Give two examples of NTDs.
    
    Anencephaly (fatal) - Due to the failure of closing the anterior neurophore. Brain tissues form abnormally and then degenerates due to exposure to amniotic fluid and then degenerates
    
    Spinal bifuda - A NTD that can occur at any spinal cord level but is present most frequently in the lumbosarcral area
    
    Most people with spina bifuda have difficulty in walking, and bowel and bladder function
    
- How can NTDs be prevented?
    
    Folic acid prevents 70% of NTDs
    
- Give an example of a congenital malformation caused by incomplete gastrulation.
    
    Caudal dysgenesis (Mermaid syndrome)
    
    Abnormal primitive streak results in incomplete gastrulation
    
    Insufficient mesoderm was made for the abnominal region and lower limb
    
- What is a teratoma?
    
    Tumor tissue derived from the three germ layers
    
    Caused by gastrulation went on too long
    

### Formation and Structure of Placenta

- What is the structure of the placenta?
    
    Decidua basalis is the maternal part of the placenta
    
    Chorion (made of trophoblast and extraembryonic mesoderm) forms the fetal portion of the placenta
    
    Chorionic villi containing fetal blood vessels grow into decidua basalis
    
- What is the function of the placenta?
    
    Gas exchange
    
    Exchange of nutrients and electrolyte
    
    Transmission of antibody from maternal blood to foetus
    
    Hormone production
    
- When material passes from maternal blood to fetal blood, it passes through the placental barrier. What constitutes the placental barrier?
    
    Syncytiotrophoblast ⇒ Cytotrophoblast ⇒ Fetal connective tissue ⇒ Fetal endothelium
    

### Twinning

- How often does twinning occur?
    
    1 in 85 pregnancies
    
- What is the death rate of twins at birth?
    
    10-20%
    
- How many percent of premature infants are twins?
    
    12%
    
- What are the two kinds of twins?
    
    Monovular (identical) twins
    
    Biovular (fraternal) twins
    
- What is dizygotic twinning? Do they share common structures?
    
    Dizygotic twinning refers to twins derived from two zygotes
    
    Each embryo have their own amnion, chorion and placenta, but the placenta may be fused
    
- What are the different types of monozygotic twining? Do twins share common structures in each type? When do they split?
    
    Dichorial, diamniotic twins: Splitting at 2 cell stage
    
    Monochorial, diamniotic twins: Splitting of inner cell mass at early development
    
    Monochorial, monoamniotic twins: Splitting of inner cell mass at late development

- What are the causes of conjoined twinning?
    
    Over-expression of head inducing gene
    
    Splitting of primitive streak
    

### Chromosome anomalies

- What is triploidy? How is it formed?
    
    Triploidy is the condition in which the zygote consist of 3 sets of chromosomes i.e. 23 triploid chromosome
    
    It is resulted from the abnormal fertilization of a normal ovum by two normal sperms
    
- What is the cause of chromosome anomalies like Monosomy and Trisomy?
    
    Nondisjunction - failure of homologous pairs to separate in anaphase of Meiosis I
    
- Give an example of disease caused by monosomy.
    
    Turner’s syndrome (XO)
    
- Give 3 examples of diseases caused by trisomy.
    
    Down’s syndrome (Trisomy 21)
    
    Edward’s syndrome (Trisomy 18)
    
    Patau’s syndrome (Trisomy 13)
    
- What are characteristic features in Edward's Syndrome patients?
    
    Fixed flexed fingers that can’t extend in children
    
    ‘rocker bottom’ feet in neonate
    
- What are characteristic features in Down's Syndrome patients?
    
    Characteristic facial features
    
    Notched eyelids and epicanthic fold (雙眼皮）
    

### Parental Diagnosis

- What are indications for the need of prenatal diagnosis?
    
    Maternal age >35
    
    Previous child with de novo chromosome abnormality
    
    Presence of a structural chromosome abnormality in the mother
    
    Family history of some genetic defect
    
- What tests do prenatal diagnosis include?
    
    Ultrasound
    
    Maternal Serum Screening
    
    Amniocentesis
    
    Chorionic Villus sampling

    Remove amniotic fluid by syringe at gestational age of 16-18
    
    Fetal cells in amniotic fluid can be cultured and karyotyped
    
    Amniotic fluid can be tested for AFP
    
- What are the risks of amniocentesis?
    
    Induce abortion and maternal infection (both very rare)
    
- Describe the procedure of chorionic villi sampling.
    
    Drawing fetal tissue for analysis through aspiration from villous area of the chorion, transcervically guided by ultrasound
    
    Carried out at gestational age of 9-12 weeks, when cells are more actively dividing
    
- What is the function of chorionic villi sampling?
