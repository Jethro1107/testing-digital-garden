### Chronic illness

Chronic illness is an umbrella term that involves a condition that requires ongoing, long term care. It involves an irreversible pathological change, and thus cannot be cured.

Chronic illness is also associated with [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Impairment and disability\|Impairment and disability]].

### Prevalence of chronic illness

There is an increasing prevalance of chronic illness due to:

1. Population ageing
    
    Chronic illness predominates in older individuals, hence with population ageing, there is an increase in prevalence of chronic illness.
    
2. Better medical care
    
    Better medical care improves survival after an acute illness or trauma, where an individual is able to survival an acute illness, and subsequently is invariably susceptible to developing chronic illness later in life.
    
    Furthermore, with availability of health [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Screening\|Screening]], more individuals are diagnosed with chronic illness.
    
3. Change in lifestyle
    
    There has been a change in lifestyle that favours unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle, which is associated with chronic illness.
    
4. Change in environment
    
    Increase in air pollution predisposes to chronic illness such as COPD and lung cancer.
    

Essentially, many factors contribute to the [[epidemiological transition\|epidemiological transition]] of disease from more acute diseases, to chronic illness.

### What does it mean to be chronically ill?

Being chronically ill is not just a biological deviance, but has greater personal, psychological, social and economic implications.

1. Managing medical regimens
    
    Living with chronic illness means a *****life-long commitment to managing medical regimens*****, which involves compliance to medication, learning new skills (e.g. insulin injection), and gaining information of how to manage symptoms and exacerbations. Furthermore, they may have to learn new medical technologies.
    
    A problem that often arises is compliance:
    
    - One might be overwhelmed with the realisation that it requires a life-long commitment
    - Compliance to medical treatment may interfere with a job.
    - Adverse effects of disease management may also interfere with compliance.
2. Biographical disruption
    
    Living with chronic illness often impacts an individuals sense of self.
    
3. Disruption in family life
    
    Living with chronic illness means a change on family roles and relationship, family members often have to assume care-giver roles.
    
    It may also put strains on family members as managing chronic illness may involve high level of care.
    
4. Disruption in social life
    
    Living with chronic illness often means withdrawal in key social roles (job, caregiver role).
    
    Many patients with chronic illness are *socially isolated*.
    
5. Uncertainty
    
    Living with chronic illness often means living with uncertainty, as it is difficult to predict the disease course. There are 3 different types of uncertainty:
    
    - Prediagnostic uncertainty
    - Trajectory uncertainty
    - Symptomatic uncertainty
6. Cost of being chronically ill
    
    Living with chronic illness often incurs high economic cost, which include:
    
    - Direct cost for health care services and medication
    - Indirect cost, such as transportation and time off

### Other than providing medical interventions, how do we help those with chronic illness?
