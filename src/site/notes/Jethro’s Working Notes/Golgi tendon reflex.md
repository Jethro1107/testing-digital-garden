### Golgi tendon reflex

The golgi tendon reflex is a somatic reflex in response to tension of the muscle, which results in reflex relaxation (lengthening reaction) in the muscle.

### Reflex arc in the golgi tendon reflex

Increase in tension of the muscle applied to the tendon stimulates the golgi tendon organ within the tendon.

This results in increased rate of action potential in Ib sensory fibres, which enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root. Much of it reaches the ventral gray horn of the spinal cord.

It stimulates inhibitor interneurons, which inhibits the alpha motor neurons (******hence a polysynaptic reflex******), resulting in relaxation of the same muscle.

### Golgi tendon reflex offers protection

In response to extreme tension on the muscle, the golgi tendon reflex results in reflex relaxation of the muscle, preventing the tearing of muscle or avulsion of the tendon from its attachment on the bone.
