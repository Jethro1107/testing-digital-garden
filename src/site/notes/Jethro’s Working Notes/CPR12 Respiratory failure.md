### Respiratory Failure

- **General definition of respiratory failure**
    - Respiratory failure - an inability of the lungs to oxygenate arterial blood, and/or prevent CO2 retention
- **Ranges of arterial PO2 and PCO2 in patients with respiratory failure**
    - No absolute threshold, but it is suggested arterial PO2 of less than 60mmHg and arterial PCO2 of greater than 50 mmHg in subjects breathing air at rest at sea level is indicative of respiratory failure

### Causes of respiratory failure

- Ventilation failure
    - **Causes of ventilation failure**
        - A defect in the respiratory control pathway between the medulla to the respiratory muscles
            - Defect in central respiratory drive (e.g. Tumor, hemorrhage or narcotic drugs, i.e. morphine and barbiturate)
            - Defect in nerves to respiratory muscles (e.g. poliomyelitis)
            - Neuromuscular diseases (myasthenia gravis - autoantibodies binding to AChR, reducing stimulation by ACh)
        - A defect in ventilatory apparatus
            - Thoracic cage disorder (e.g. kyphoscoliosis, morbid obesity)
            - Respiratory muscle weakness due to trauma
            - Limitations to lung expansion caused by interstitial lung disease (e.g. pulmonary fibrosis)
            - Airway obstruction (e.g COPD)
- Gas exchange failure
    - **Causes of gas exchange failure**
        - A defect in alveolo-capillary membrane (increased thickness or decreased surface area)
        - VQ mismatching (e.g. in interstitial lung disease, COPD, vascular disease)

### Pattern of gas exchange in respiratory failure

- Type 1 respiratory failure (Gas exchange failure)
    - **Effects on arterial blood gases of type 1 respiratory failure**
        - Decrease in arterial PO2 and no CO2 retention (decrease or constant PCO2)
        - Arterial PO2 below 60mmHg, while arterial PCO2 equal to or below than 50mmHg
        - Results in hypoxemia but no CO2 retention
    - **Examples of Type 1 respiratory failure**
        - Interstitial lung disease
            - **Effects of interstitial lung disease**
                - Causes VQ mismatching and diffusion impairments
                - Results in hypoxemia, but maintains PCO2 at normal levels
            - **Effects of ventilatory response to interstitial lung disease**
                - Effective for normalizing PCO2, but not PO2 (due to the shape of the oxygen dissociation curve)
        - Acute respiratory distress syndrome
            - **Effects of ARDS**
                - VQ mismatching, diffusion impairments, shunts
                - Results in hypoxemia, and a fall in arterial PCO2
            - **Effectiveness of ventilatory compensation**
                - Severe ventilatory compensation unable to overcome hypoxemia, and causes a decrease in arterial PCO2
- Type 2 respiratory failure (Ventilatory failure)
    - **Effects on arterial blood gases of type 2 respiratory failure**
        - Decreases arterial PO2 and causes CO2 retention (increase in arterial PCO2)
        - Arterial PO2 falls below 60mmHg while arterial PCO2 rises above 50mmHg
        - Results in hypoxemia and CO2 retention
    - **Examples of type 2 respiratory failure**
        - Hypoventilation
            - **Effects of hypoventilation**
                - Inadequate alveolar ventilation
                - Results in hypoxemia and CO2 rentention
            - **Effects of ventilatory compensation to hypoventilation**
                - No ventilatory responses due to defects in respiratory control pathway between medulla and respiratory muscles, or a defect in ventilatory apparatus
        - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
            - **Effects of COPD**
                - VQ mismatching
                - Results in hypoxemia and CO2 retention, but less CO2 is retained when compared with hypoventilation (i.e. Hypoxemia is more severe in relations to CO2 retention)
            - **Effectiveness of ventilatory response to COPD**
                - Ventilatory compensation is limited by high airway resistance, hence hypoxemia and hypercapnia remains

### Pulmonary function in respiratory failure

- Hypoxemia
    - **Causes of hypoxemia**
        - Hypoxemia, diffusion impairments, shunts, VQ mismatching
    - **Detection of hypoxemia**
        - Central cyanosis, tachycardia, mental clouding due to direct depressant action on CNS
        - Identification of hypoxemia is done by finding of low oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry
    - [[  Effects of Hypoxemia\|  Effects of Hypoxemia]]**
        - Tissue hypoxia ↓
            - Results in anaerobic glycolysis and increase in lactic acid production, resulting in metabolic acidosis
        - Physiological changes due to hypoxemia
            - Mild hypoxemia (60mmHg)
                - impaired mental performance
                - Diminished visual acuity
                - Mild hypertension
            - Severe hypoxemia (<40mmHg)
                - CNS - Headaches, sleepiness, cloudiness of consciousness
                - CVS - tachycardia, mild hypertension
                - Pulmonary hypertension due to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
            - Very severe hypoxemia
                - CNS - permanent damage
                - CVS - bradycaria, hypotension, cardiac arrest
                - Severe pulmonary hypertension due to hypoxic vasoconstriction
                - Renal - Proteinuria, sodium retention
- Hypercapnia
    - **Causes of hypercapnia**
        - Hypoventilation, VQ mismatching, injudicious use of O2 therapy
    - **Effects of injudicious use of O2 therapy on arterial PCO2 levels**
        - Injudicious use of O2 therapy abolishes the hypoxic ventilatory drive, causing a decrease in ventilation, contributing to hypoventilation
        - It also causes the abolishment of hypoxic pulmonary constriction, worsening VQ mismatch
        - The combined effect results in hypercapnia
    - **Effects of hypercapnia**
        - Moderate hypercapnia
            - Cerebral vasodilation, results in increased cerebral blood flow, causing headaches
        - Severe hypercapnia
            - CO2 narcosis
            - Cloudiness of consciousness
- Acidosis
    - Respiratory acidosis
        - **Cause of respiratory acidosis**
            - CO2 retention
        - **Occurence of respiratory acidosis**
            - Only occurs in ventilatory failure (Type II respiratory failure)
    - Metabolic acidosis
        - **Cause of metabolic acidosis in respiratory failure**
            - Hypoxemia may contribute to tissue hypoxia, resulting in lactic acid production, and thus metabolic acidosis
            - Metabolic acidosis often co-exist with respiratory acidosis

    - **Definition of hypoxia**
        - Hypoxia - deficiency of O2 at a cellular level

    - Treatment of underlying disease
    - **Correction of deficits in pulmonary function**
        - Treatment for hypoxemia
            - O2 therapy
            - Mechanical ventilation
            - Mechanical ventilation with positive end expiratory pressure

            - Removal of secretion
                - Encouragement to cough
                - Aspiration of secretion by broncoscopy

        - Treatment for cardiac failure
            - Diuretics for edema and fluid retention
            - Digitalis for heart failure
            - **How respiratory failure causes heart failure**
                - Hypoxic pulmonary constriction increases pulmonary blood perssure, increasing workload of right heart, causing right heart failure (cor pulmonale)
                - Hypoxic kidney results in increased erythropoietin production, resulting in increase in number of erythrocytes, thus increasing density of blood, hence increasing heart workload, contributing to cardiac failure
                - Hypercapnia may result in electrolyte retention in kidneys, resulting in increased water retention, thus increasing blood flowing an hence heart workload, contributing to cardiac failure
- Hazards of treatment
    - **Hazards of O2 therapy**
        - Abolishment of hypoxic respiratory drive, resulting in decreased ventilation and CO2 retention, which is not ideal as [[PO2 is an important [[Acclimatization to low\|PO2 is an important [[Acclimatization to low]] of ventilation while [[PCO2 has a low potency on stimulating [[Acclimatization to high\|PCO2 has a low potency on stimulating [[Acclimatization to high]] in patients with chronic hypoxemia and CO2 retention
        - Abolishment of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, resulting in worsening VQ mismatching and CO2 retention
        - O2 toxicity causes damage to airway and alveolar epithelium, resulting in pulmonary edema and fibrosis
        - Absorption actelatasis→increased shunt
            - Collapse of alveolus due to absorption of gas from lungs to blood
        - Retrolental fibroplasia (fibrosis behind lens, resulting in blindness)
    - **Hazards of mechanical ventilation**
        - Alveolar damage, resulting in pneumothorax
        - Decreased venous return in mechanical ventilation with positive end expiratory pressure)
