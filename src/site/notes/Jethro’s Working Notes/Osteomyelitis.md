### Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is the infection of bone, particularly involving the periosteum, medullary cavity and the cortical bone/ compact bone.

Osteomyelitis can be classified into acute osteomyelitis and chronic osteomyelitis.

- ******Pathophysiology of osteomyelitis******
    
    Local inflammation in bones results in increased exudation. As the hard bone matrix is unable to expand, this results in increase in pressure within the osteon, which results in obliteration of the harvesian canal and blood vessels.
    
    This results in ischemia, and necrosis of the bone, forming a sequestrum (a piece of avascular infected bone). By definition, formation of sequestrum indicates chronic osteomyelitis.
    
    Subperiosteal extension of the infection will lift the periosteum, which stimulates [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoblast\|Osteoblast]] to lay down new bone, resulting in new bone formation.

- ************************************************************************************************************Routes of infection of acute and chronic osteomyelitis************************************************************************************************************
    
    For acute osteomyelitis, it is caused by:
    
    - Haemotogenous spread (usually monomicrobial) - In children, it usually causes osteomyelitis in the epiphysis of long bones, whereas in adults, it usually causes acute vertebral osteomyelitis.
    - Contiguous spread (often polymicrobial) - Direct innoculation of bacteria through trauma, surgery on bones, open fractures, or chronic soft tissue infections.
    
    For chronic osteomyelitis, it is usually caused by untreated or inadequately treated osteoarthritis, but also by tuberculosis.
    
- ****************************Etiology of osteomyelitis****************************
    
    For acute haematogenous osteomyelitis, the etiology differs with age:
    
    - In neonates - Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), E. Coli
    - In children (> 1 year old) - Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Haemophilus influenzae
    - In older children and adults - Mainly caused by staphylococcus aureus. Vertebral osteomyelitis in adults can also be caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB).
    
    For contiguous osteomyelitis, the etiology is often polymicrobial:
    
    - Staphylococcus aureus, gram negative bacilli, streptococci, enterococci and anaerobic organisms.
- ********************************************************************Clinical features of osteomyelitis********************************************************************
    
    Acute osteomyelitis:
    
    - Commonly presents with pain and tenderness over infected bone, fever and leukocytosis.
    - There may be minimal or non-specific symptoms in some patients, such as infants and Intravenous drug users.
    
    Chronic osteomyelitis:
    
    - Presents much more indolently.
    - It commonly presents with chronic pain, *drainage into sinus tract*, and a low grade fever.
    - It can also present relatively assymptomatic.
- ****************************************************Diagnosis of osteomyelitis****************************************************
    
    A clinical diagnosis can be made on presentation.
    
    Radiological diagnosis:
    
    - Plain radiographs may not be as useful as there is significant lag behind the evolution of disease.
    - MRI, CT and Radionuclide imaging is much more useful.
    - Radiological features, such as osteolytic lesions and periosteal elevation may be observed.

    Microbial diagnosis:
    
    - Blood culture
    - Culture of biopsy of bone lesion
    - Culture of drainage from sinus tract is not used for microbial diagnosis
