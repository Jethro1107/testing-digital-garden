### Cancer as a Multigenic Disorder

- In average how many mutation events is required in developing cancer?
    
    3-7 mutations, depending on cancer type

- From the theoretical model, why may cancer still develop when probability of six mutation events is too low?
    
    Multistage model:
    
    Cancer happens because earlier mutations can:
    
    1. Enhance cell proliferation creating a large target population for subsequent mutations
    2. Increases overall mutation rate (mutations in mutator genes i.e. DNA repair genes)

### Oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and mutator genes

- What are oncogenes? Give examples.
    
    Proto-oncogenes regulate cell proliferation
    
    Oncogenes are mutated alleles of proto-oncogenes, enhancing proliferation
    
    EGFR (Growth factor receptor, HRAS (G protein for signal transduction), FOS (DNA-binding transcription factor)
    
- Describe the nature of activation of oncogenes in carcinogenesis. How may activation of oncogenes occur? Give examples.
    
    Requires a one hit activation to enhance proliferation
    
    1. By insertion of viral DNA
    2. Translocation
        
        MYC gene is translocated to IGH gene, active promoter of IGH gene causes over expression to MYC gene, forming normal myc proteins
        
        Translation of ABL gene to BCR gene produces a fusion protein, a tyrosine kinase that is constitutively active

    3. Gene amplification (of MYC gene)
    4. Point mutation (causes hyperactive protein)
- What are tumour suppressor genes? Give examples.
    
    Tumour suppressor genes are genes that suppress cell proliferation
    
    RB, p16, p53 (other than suppressing cell proliferation, also stimulates senescence and apoptosis)
    
- Describe the nature of inactivation of tumour suppressor genes in carcinogenesis.
    
    Requires 2 hit inactivation
    
    For some tumour suppressor genes, one mutated copy is required to cause a phenotype because of haplo-insufficiency or dominant negative effect (mutated protein interferes with normal protein function, e.g. P53 forms a tetramer, where mutated subunits fuse with normal subunit to give a non-productive tetramer)
    
- What are mutator genes? Give examples.
    
    DNA repair genes are genes that function in DNA repair pathways
    
    Mutated alleles of DNA repair genes are Mutator genes, that increase the mutation rate
    
    hMSH2 (human MutS Homolog 2) in DNA mismatch repair pathway
    
    ATM (Ataxia Teangiectasia Mutated) a kinase involved in repair of double strand break
    
- Describe the nature of inactivation of mutator genes in carcinogenesis
    
    Requires 2 hit inactivation
    

### Colorectal cancer to illustrate multigenic process

- Why is colorectal cancer the perfect cancer for studying the multistep process of carcinogenesis?
    
    Easily assessible by colonoscopy and staged
    
    The stages:
    
    Normal Epithelium → Hyperproliferative Epithelium → Early Adenoma → Intermediate adenoma → Late adenoma → Carcinoma
    
- Describe how APC gene is involved in Wnt pathway.
    
    APC is involved in APC containing complex that degrades beta-catenin, which is binds to a transcription factor for certain genes leading to cell proliferation
    
    With Wnt signal, this activates a protein signal protein to inactivate the APC-containing complex. Hence, beta-catenin is not degraded and can bind to the transcription factor complex for transcription of genes that are involved in cell proliferation
    
    APC keeps the Wnt signalling pathway inactive when the cell is not exposed to Wnt proteins

- What is the proposed sequence of mutations in FAP?
    
    Mutation in APC gene (TS gene) allows entry into breakthrough phase (adenoma)
    
    Activation of KRAS oncogene 
    
    Mutation of SMAD4 gene (TS gene)
    
    Mutation of TP53 gene
    
- What is the three strikes model?
    
    Entry into breakthrough phase
    
    Expansion phase
    
    Invasion phase
