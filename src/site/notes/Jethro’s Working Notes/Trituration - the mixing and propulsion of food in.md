### Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme

Trituration enables the mixing of food with [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Gastric secretions\|Gastric secretions]], and the subsequent of food in the stomach to give *****chyme*****.

- ********************************************************************************Trituration is mediated by slow waves ([[Interstitial cells of Cajal generate slow potentials and spike potentials that mediate gastric motor functions\|Interstitial cells of Cajal generate slow potentials and spike potentials that mediate gastric motor functions]])**
    
    Propagating constricting rings of contraction occuring at a frequency of 3 contractions per minute pushes gastric contents towards the antrum.
    
    As the pyloric sphincter remains closed, much of gastric contents remain in the antrum, causing the antrum to become pressurized. This squeezes the gastric contents back up the stomach, opposite to the direction of the propagating constricting rings of contraction (retropulsion).
    
    The shear stress created when gastric contents move in opposite directions is sufficient to break down food into smaller particles.
