### Microbiological diagnosis of Enteric Infections

The entire process involves sample collection to culture.

**Sample collection**

What is the best sample for microbiological diagnosis of enteric infections? Obviously, *stool sample* would be the gold standard, but patients coming in may not be able to provide stool on demand. *Rectal swab can hence be used as a surrogate.* Note that the rectal swab should at least be stained with faeces (i.e. you should insert the swab far enough into the rectum).

**Culture**

Unlike, say, microbiological diagnosis for respiratory tract infections, aetiological diagnosis for enteric infections is like finding a needle in a haystack, as the stool sample consist of a large number of non-etiological bacteria, owing to the gut microbiota. *A panel of selective and differential agars should be used to try to pinpoint the underlying etiological bacteria:*

- MacConkey agar - MacConkey agar enables growth, or selective for, of G- bacterias (most enteric bacterias are G- bacterias) and consist of bile salt to inhibit the growth of G+ bacterias. It also differentiates lactose-fermenting bacterias (pink or red colonies), from non-lactose-fermenting bacteria (colourless colonies, while the agar remains yellow).

- Sorbitol MacConkey agar - Sorbitol MacConkey agar replaces lactose in normal MacConkey agar with sorbitol. Most lactose-fermenting bacteria can also ferment sorbitol (pink colonies), except for EHEC, hence, It is used for differentiating E. Coli O157:H7 (EHEC), as it cannot ferment sorbitol (colourless colonies on yellow agar).

- XLD agar - XLD agar is an agar used to differentiate salmonella species. Salmonella species produce black colonies

- TCBS agar - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/TCBS medium differentiates Vibrio species\|TCBS medium differentiates Vibrio species]].

**Serotyping for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Typhoidal salmonellae\|Typhoidal salmonellae]] - Widal’s test**

Widal’s test consist of serial dilution of patients serum and then adding different antigenic preparations: O antigen for Typhi, H antigen for Typhi, H antigen for Paratyphi A, H Antigen for Paratyphi B, and H Antigen for Paratyphi C.

Agglutination indicates the presence of Antibodies against that antigen, confirming the etiological agents.

A 4 fold increase in titre after 14 days is required to confirm an active infection.
