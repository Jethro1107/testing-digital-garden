### Principlism provides a mental framework that enables us to make decisions in ethical dilemmas

Principlism, or the 4 pillars of medical ethics provide us a mental framework to work with when facing ethical dilemmas. The four pillars are: 1) Autonomy 2) Beneficence 2)Non-maleficence and 4) Justice.

The use of principlism is practical in real world decision making, and is based on universal principles, which would definitely enable us to have a more holistic view on the dilemma and thus make better decisions. However, certain principles may come in conflict.

### Informed consent consist of 3 components, all of which protects patients’ autonomy

An informed consent includes:

1. Mental capacity ([[Mental capacity refers to the ability to understand, retain, weigh up and communicate the decision\|Mental capacity refers to the ability to understand, retain, weigh up and communicate the decision]])
2. Sufficient information
3. Free of coercion

### A minor is able to give informed consent when Gillick competence is established

A minor (<16 years old) can give informed consent when Gillick competence is established, that is through proving that he/she can understand, retain, weigh up and communicate the decision (i.e. have metal capacity).

Parents are unable to refute the informed consent, but the court potentially can.

### **Confidentiality must be respected to maintain good doctor-patient relationship**

### Patient’s family are unable to demand treatment if it is thought to be physiologically futile

When a treatment is deemed to be physiologically futile ([[A physiologically futile treatment cannot reverse the underlying pathology of the patient\|A physiologically futile treatment cannot reverse the underlying pathology of the patient]]), patient’s family cannot demand sustaining treatment. The clinical team can make the decision to withdraw or withhold treatment.

Note that this is different from benefit-burden futility, where patients or patients family can decide whether they want the treatment.

### Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are completely different concepts

Physician-assised suicide is the prescription of a lethal dose of a substance at the patients request where the patient takes it with the definite intention to end his/her own life

Euthanasia is the administration of a lethal dose of a substance

Voluntary euthanasia is the administration of a lethal dose of a substance at a patients request

Non-voluntary euthanasia is the administration of a lethal dose of a substance where the decision is made by another person

Involuntary euthanasia is the administration of a lethal dose of a substance that is against the wishes of an individual

### Withdrawal of physiologically futile treatment is not euthanasia

### The validity of an advanced directive can be challenged under these conditions

Advanced directives are recognised as valid under common law, unless challenged on the grounds of:

1. Ambiguously drafted
2. Not signed
3. Made under coercion
4. Reasons to believe patient did not have mental capacity when signing the advanced directive
5. Patient has done something that is against advanced directive, which could implicate that

### Good Samaritan Law provides legal protection to voluntary rescuers (but not in HK legislation)
