### Helicobacter pylori

- Bacteriology of Helicobacter pylori
    - **Gram stain properties of Helicobacter pylori**
        
        Helicobacter pylori is a gram negative, spiral shaped, bacterium, or a curved bacilli.
        
    - **Oxygen requirements of Helicobacter pylori**
        
        Helicobacter pylori grows in a microaerophilic environment (5% O2).
        
    - **Virulence factors of Helicobacter pylori**
        
        It consist of 4-6 unipolar *flagella*, enabling motility in viscous mucus.
        
        It is also *strongly urease positive*, enabling it to split urea to give ammonia. Ammonia produced neutralizes acid, enabling it to survive in acidic pH in the presence of urea.
        
- Epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori
    
    Humans are the only significant natural reservoir for Helicobacter pylori, where infection is usually acquired during childhood. It has a worldwide distribution, but is declining in prevalence in recent years due to high eradication rates. 
    
    - **Routes of transmission of Helicobacter pylori**
        
        Transmission is likely to be person-to-person, via the feco-oral route.
        
        Intra-familial transmission appears to be important.
        
    - **Risk factors of Helicobacter pylori**
        - Poor personal hygiene in childhood
        - Crowded families
        - Absence of sanitary drinking water
        - Absence of sewage disposal facilities
        - Low education
        - Poor socio-economic development
- **Pathology of Helicobacter pylori**
    
    Helicobacter pylori infection is a **chronic infection**.
    
    *Helicobacter pylori causes a chronic inflammation (regardless of the presence of clinical disease*) - There is infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells and the occasional neutrophil. There may be variable degree of inflammation, from minimal changes to severe dense inflammation and microabscess formation.
    
    Chronic helicobacter pylori infection also causes *atrophy of the gastric mucosa*.
    
- **Clinical manifestations of Helicobacter pylori infections**
    
    The acute Helicobacter pylori infection is usually asymptomatic, but will always progress into chronic gastritis.
    
    The outcomes of chronic gastritis:
    
    - Persistance of chronic gastritis - Often asymptomatic (>80%)
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peptic ulcer\|Peptic ulcer]] disease - [[Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with 95% of duodenal ulcers and 70% of gastric ulcers.\|Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with 95% of duodenal ulcers and 70% of gastric ulcers.]]
        - Helicobacter pylori infections predominantly presents as antral-predominent gastritis with increased acid secretion, as a result of increased gastrin secretion and decreased somatostatin secretions, This usually results in duodenal ulcers.
        - Pangastritis is associated with gastric ulcers.
    - Chronic atrophic gastritis - which is associated with subsequent development of gastric adenocarcinoma ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Neoplasia of the stomach\|Neoplasia of the stomach]])
    - Gastric Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)-type low grade B cell lymphoma
- **Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infections**
    
    Helicobacter pylori infections can be diagnosed by bacteriological diagnosis, histological diagnosis, antigen detection and urease-based test.
    
    **Bacteriological diagnosis:** 
    
    Obtain endoscopic gastric mucosal biopsies and culture in a microaerophilic environment.
    
    However, it is not as sensitive as histology due to sampling error, but is essential for antibiotic sensitivity testing and to exclude malignancy.
    
    **Histological diagnosis:**
    
    At least 2 biopsies is required. Helicobacter pylori infection is recognised by its characteristic morphology and its position in the mucous gel layer.
    
    There is also presence of inflammation.
    
    Stains used include: Giemsa sstain, Haematoxylin and eosin, Warthin-Starry stain and immunostaining.
    
    **Stool antigen detection:**
    
    Immunochromatographic assays (Lateral flow assays) is a point of care tool used, but is less sensitive.
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    Enzyme immuunoassays (ELISA) is laboratory-based test, and is more sensitive.
    
    **Urease-based test:**
    
    Rapid urease test - It involves endoscopic biopsy and mixing with a broth containing urea and pH indicator. If Helicobacter pylori is present, it would split the urea to give ammonia to produce a colour change.
    
    Urea breath test - It involves drinking a urea broth where the C atom is labelled (C-13 is not radioactive and more commonly used, while C-14 is radioactive and is phased out). If Helicobacter pylori is present, CO2 exhaled will consist of the labelled C atom and can be detected by mass spectrometry.

    Serology of antibodies against H. pylori is not diagnostic, but more commonly used for prevalence studies.
    
- **Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections**
    
    Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections aims at eradication of H. pylori, not just the absence of it.
    
    3 conventional treatment regimens is described, 2 triple therapies, and a quadruple therapy.
    
    *Bismuth-based triple therapy* - Consist of Bismuth and 2 antibiotics.
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    *PPI-based triple therapy* - Consist of PPI and 2 antibiotics.
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    *Quadruple therapy* - Consist of Bismuth, a PPI and 2 antibiotics. It is a second-line rescue therapy for patients who failed other regimens, and first-line therapy when there is high level of antibiotic restistance.
    
- **Follow up after eradication of Helicobacter pylori**
    
    Urea breath test is the preferred method for assessing the success of therapy.
