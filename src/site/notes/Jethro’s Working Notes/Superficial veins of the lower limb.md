### Superficial veins of the lower limb

There are two superficial veins of the lower limb: 1) ******Great saphenous vein******, 2) *********************small saphenous vein.*********************

- **********************Great saphenous vein**********************
    
    The great saphenous vein drains blood from the *dorsal venous arch of the foot and the dorsal veins of the great toe* and originates from **anterior of the medial malleolus**, and ascends along the medial aspect of the leg, passes posterior to the medial condyle of the femur, and up the medial aspect of the thigh.
    
    It then traverse the saphenous opening (an opening in the fascia lata 3-4cm inferior to the pubic tubercle), and drains into the femoral vein.

- ****************************************Small saphenous vein****************************************
    
    The small saphenous vein originates from posterior of the lateral malleolus, and ascends on the posterior surface of the leg, and eventually pierces through the fascia lata to drain into the popliteal vein, in the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Popliteal fossa\|Popliteal fossa]].
