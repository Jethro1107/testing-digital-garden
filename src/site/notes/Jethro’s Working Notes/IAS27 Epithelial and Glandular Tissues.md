### Embryonic origins, function and properties of Epithelial Tissues

- Which embryonic germ layer(s) do epithelial tissues develop from?
    
    Epithelial tissues originate from all three germ layers
    
    Ectoderm - epithelium of the skin
    
    Mesoderm - kidney tubules, mesothelium (lining of body cavities), endothelium (lining blood vessels and lymphatics)
    
    Endoderm - Epithelial linings of respiratory tract and GI tract
    
- What are the functions of epithelial tissues?
    
    Protection from injury, dehydration and infection by covering of body surfaces by eidermis of skin
    
    Absorption by digestive epithelium
    
    Transport by kidney tubules, blood vessels, lymph vessels
    
    Sensation by retina and olfactory epithelia
    
    Secretion by glandular epithelium
    
- How does epithelial tissue interact with connective tissues?
    
    Blood capillaries in connective tissues supply oxygen and nutrients to the epithelial cells and remove metabolic wastes from them
    
- What is the basement membrane?
    
    Epithelium lies on basement membrane, which separates the epithelium from the connective tissues
    
    It is made of the basal lamina (type 4 collagen) and the reticular lamina (type 3 collagen)
    
- What are the properties of epithelial tissues?
    
    Junctional complexes between epithelial cells
    
    Little to no intercellular matrix
    
    Rests on basal membrane
    
    Avascular (supported by connective tissue underneath)
    
    Contains cytokeratin to resist physical force applied on epithelium
    

### Classification and types of Epithelial Tissues

- What are the classification criteria of epithelial tissues?
    
    Number of layers - simple, stratified
    
    Shape of cells (determined by shape of nucleus) - squamous (flat/oval nucleus parallel to axis of epithelium), cuboidal (circular nucleus), columnar (oval nucleus perpendicular to axis of epithelium
    
- What are examples of simple squamous epithelium?
    
    Lining of alveolar in lungs, mesothelium (lining of pleural and peritoneal cavities) and endothelium (lining the heart, blood vessels and lymph vessels)
    
- What are examples of simple cuboidal epithelium?
    
    Pancreatic duct
    
- What are examples of simple columnar epithelium?
    
    Epithelial lining of intestine and gall bladder
    
- What are examples of simple ciliated columnar epithelium?
    
    Oviduct epithelium
    
- What are examples of stratified cuboidal/columnar epithelium?
    
    Male urethra, vas deferens
    
    Excretory ducts of exocrine glands
    
- What are examples of stratified squamous epithelium?
    
    Oral cavity, oesophagus, vagina (non-keratinized)
    
    skin (keratinised)
    
    To protect against abrasions
    
    Surface is lubricated by glands in connective tissues with ducts extending to the epithelial surface
    
- What are examples of transitional epithelium?
    
    Bladder, ureter
    
    Squamous when stretched, cuboidal when relaxed
    
- What are examples of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium?
    
    Upper respiratory epithelium / trachea
    

### Surface specializations of epithelium

- Since epithelial cells have distinct polarity, what are the names of the different surfaces of the epithelial cells?
    
    Apical (top)
    
    Lateral
    
    Basal (bottom)
    
- What kind of specializations can be found on the apical surface?
    
    Microvilli, cilia
    
    - Describe the features of microvilli
        
        Each microvilli consist of an actin core, anchored to the terminal web, which consist of actin and myosin
        
        Microvilli are not mobile on their own
        
        Contraction of terminal web decreases the area of apical surface, thus microvilli move further apart
        
    - Describe the features of cilia
        
        Each cilia consist of an axoneme (ring of 9 microtubule dublets with 2 centrally located microtubules) anchored to the basal bodies (9 microtubule triplets)
        
        Cilia are mobile on their own
        
    - What is the difference of microvilli and cilia?
- What kind of specializations can be found on the lateral surfaces?
    
    Junctional complexes, desmosomes, gap junctions
    
    - What junctions can be found within the junctional complex?
        
        Tight junctions (Zonular occuldens) - Joins cell membrane of neighboring epithelial cells together, effectively sealing the intracellular space
        
        Tight junction is not strong enough to resist stretching force
        
        Adhering junction (Zonular adherens) - Associated with actin to form the terminal web, reinforces the tight junction to form a strong junctional complex
        
    - What are desmosomes?
        
        Desmosomes are plaque like structures found on the lateral surface of epithelial cells, tethering tonofilaments (interfilaments) to the cell membrane
        
        Desmosomes on adjacent cells are held together by cadherin
        
        Hemidesmosomes are basal specializations that anchor epithelial cells to the basal membrane
        
    - What are gap junctions?
        
        Specialised junctions between adjacent plasma membranes consisting of connexons composed of connexins, specialised channels for passage of molecules, ions and electrical impulses between cells
        
        They are present in smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells to allow rapid communication to synchronise muscle contractions
        
- What kind of specializations can be found on the basal surfaces?
    
    Basal membrane interdigitations (infoldings)
    
    Extensive basal infoldings with numerous mitochondria for absorption and secretion
    

### Glandular epithelium: Epithelium specialized for secretion

- What are the two types of glands?
    
    Exocrine glands and endocrine glands
    
- What is an example of single cell glands? What is the features of it?
    
    Goblet cells
    
    Wine glass shape
    
    Nucleus at the handle, golgi complex in the middle, and secretory vesicles containing mucous at the top
    
- What are the different types of multiceullular glands?
    
    Mucous glands - Secrets thick and slimy mucin, is pale staining due to cytoplasm, and has a flattened nucleus at the lower proportion of the cell
    
    Serous glands - secrets protein/enzymes which has a water texture, is basophilic staining, and consists of a round nuclei
    
- What are the different modes of secretion?
    
    Merocrine secretion - no loss of cytoplasm as secretory vesicles can pass through membrane
    
    Apocrine secretion - partial loss of cytoplasm
    
    Holocrine secretion - complete cell disintegration
    
- How do we classify exocrine glands?
    
    By branching of duct - simple vs compund
    
    By shape of secretory unit - tubular vs acinar vs tubuloacinar
    
    By branching of secretory unit - branched vs no branch
    
    Coiled or not
