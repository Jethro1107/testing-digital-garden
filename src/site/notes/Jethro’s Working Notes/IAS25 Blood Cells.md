### Introduction of haematopoietic system

- What are the two components of whole blood?
    
    Blood Plasma: Water, proteins, other solutes like gases, nutrients, electrolytes, metabolic wastes
    
    Formed components: RBC, WBC, platelets
    
- What stem cells are formed elements of blood derived from? Draw a diagram.

- What is the definition of haematopoiesis?
    
    Haematopoiesis - The production of blood cells
    
- Where does haematopoiesis occur in the embryonic stage?
    
    Yolk sac, liver, spleen, thymus, lymph node
    
- Where does haematopoiesis occur 3 months before birth?
    
    Red bone marrow
    
- Where does haematopoiesis occur in adulthood?
    
    Red bone marrow found in the skull, ribs, sternum, vertebral column, pelvis, proximal ends of femur
    
- What are bone marrows?
    
    Connective tissues found in the medullary cavities of bones
    
    Classified into red bone marrows and yellow bone marrows
    
    Red bone marrow is responsible for bone haematopoiesis white yellow bone marrow consist of fat cells
    
    In infant, mostly red bone marrow is present. As we age, red bone marrow is replaced by yellow bone marrow, thus rate of blood cell formation is reduced
    
    In adults, red bone marrow can only be found in the proximal ends of long bones
    
    Yellow bone marrow can be reverted to red bone marrow when required during haemorrhage
    

### Red blood cells

- What is red blood cells also called?
    
    Erythrocytes
    
- What is the structure of RBC?
    
    Biconcave structure - thick rim, thin centre
    
    Non-nucleated, devoid of other organelles, hence no metabolic activities
    
    Packed with haemoglobin, which carries oxygen with haem, and makes blood red
    
- What is the function of RBC?
    
    Transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide
    
- What is the lifespan of RBC? How is erythropoiesis regulated?
    
    120 lifespan
    
    Regulated by a negative feedback mechanism:
    
    Low erythrocyte number results in hypoxia
    
    Low blood oxygen level is detected by kidney, releasing hormone erythropoietin
    
    This stimulates red bone marrow to form erythrocytes
    
    Erythrocyte number increase and hence blood oxygen level rise
    
- Describe the process of erythropoiesis.
    
    Begins in the red bone marrow as proerythroblast
    Cell size decreases, nucleus size decreases and cytoplasm volume increases
    
    Once the nucleus is ejected, the reticulocyte is formed, which then forms the erythrocyte
    
- How is erythrocyte broken down?
    
    Broken down in liver and spleen
    
    Haem is broken down into iron and bile
    
    Globin is hydrolysed to reuse free amino acids
    

### White blood cells

- What is white blood cells also called?
    
    Leukocytes
    
- How is WBC classified?
    
    Granulocytes and Agranulocytes
    
    - What are granulocytes? How are they further classified?
        
        Granules present. Further classified into neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils
        
    - What are agranulocytes? How are they further classified?
        
        Granules absent. Further classified into monocytes and lymphocytes
        
    - Neutrophils
        - What proportion of WBC does neutrophil make up?
            
            Most abudnant WBC (60% - 70%)
            
        - What is the nature of granules?
            
            Neutrophilic - granules does not attract acidic or basic stains
            
            Thus giving a neutral, clear stain
            
        - What is the morphology of the nucleus?
            
            Polymorphonuclear - Lobulated nucleus with each lobe connected by chromatin

            Phagocytosis in response to bacterial infections
            
    - Basophils
        - What proportion of WBC does basophil make up?
            
            < 1%
            
        - What is the nature of granules?
            
            Basophilic - granules attract basic stains
            
            Thus giving a blue/purple stain
            
        - What is the morphology of the nucleus?
            
            Nucleus stains pale basophilic (blue-purple)
            
            Often obscured by the density of granules (made unclear by granules)
            
        - What is the function of basophils?
            
            Increase intensity of allergic reactions as granules release heparin and histamine
            
    - Eosinophils
        - What proportion of WBC does eosinophil make up?
            
            2-4%
            
        - What is the nature of granules?
            
            Eosinophilic - granules attract acidic stains
            
            Thus giving red stains

            Increase response to allergic reactions (release chemicals to neutralize histamine), inflammatory response and parasitic infestation
            
            High affinity to antigen-antibody complex
            
    - Monocytes
        - What proportion of WBC do monocytes make up?
            
            3-8%
            
        - What is the morphology of the nucleus?
            
            Kidney/horseshoe-shaped
            
        - What is the colour of the cytoplasm?
            
            Cytoplasm is blue/gray due to presence of lysosomes, which are azurophilic (blue-liking) granules
            
        - What is the function of monocytes?
            
            Precursors of macrophages, usually transported in the blood but enter tissues and become macrophages, which are powerful phagocytes
            
            Increased number of monocytes can be observed during infection or inflammation
            
    - Lymphocytes

            20-30%
            
        - What is the morphology of the nucleus?
            
            Round
            
        - What is the colour of the cytoplasm?
            
            Blue
            
        - What is the function of lymphocytes?
            
            Increased number during infections
            
            B and T lymphocytes trigger immune response
            
            NK cells kill infected target cells
            
            Dendritic cells present antigen
            

### Platelets

- What is platelets also called?
    
    Thrombocytes
    
- What is the structure of thrombocytes?
    
    Small and non-nucleated
    
- How is thrombopoiesis regulated? Describe the process of thrombopoeisis.
    
    Regulated by thrombopoietin, produced mainly by the liver, but also by the kidneys
    
    Thrombocytes are derived from megakaryoblasts and megakaryocytes
    
    Megacaryotes are the immediate precursors of thrombocytes
    
    They are the largest cells in bone marrow, with a large, irregular nucleus, the cytoplasm is filled with basophilic granules (blue-purple)
    
    Platelets are formed from the fragmentation of the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes
    
- What is Haemostasis? How is it regulated by thrombocytes?
    
    Haemostasis is the process of stopping bleeding, that is by keeping blood in damaged blood vessels
    
    Thrombocytes detect damage to the endothelial lining of blood vessels
    
    If damage is detected, a blood clot (platelet plug) is produced
    
    Platelets also attract other blood cells to increase the size of plug
    
    Platelets release adhesive glycoproteins to hold the clot together
    
    Eventually, they repair damaged blood vessels by clot retraction
