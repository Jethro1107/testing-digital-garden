### Penicillin

- **Antibiotic class of penicillin**
    
    Beta-lactams
    
- **Antibacterial activity of penicillin**
    
    Bactericidal
    

- **MOA of penicillin**
    
    Transpeptidation/Formation of peptidoglycan NAM-NAM cross-links is catalysed by penicillin binding proteins (PBP), which has Transpeptidase (TPase) activity
    
    Penicillin covalently binds to and inhibits these TPase enzymes (PBP)
    
    However, additional NAM and NAG is added without the formation of cross-links
    
    The integrity of the peptidoglycan layer is reduced and weakened
    
    Cell wall synthesis inhibition activates autolysin to destroy existing cell walls, which results in cell lysis due to the osmotic pressure
    
    Cf: [[    Mechanism of Action    \|    Mechanism of Action    ]] 
    
- **How does penicillin reach its site of action?**
    
    In Gram positive (G+) bacteria, it directly diffuses across the peptidoglycan layer and binds to PBP
    
    In Gram negative (G-) bacteria, it requires active transport via hydrophilic channels (e.g. porin channels) across the outer membrane

            Addition of hydrophilic groups facilitate the uptake of antipsueudomonal penicillins in gram negative bacteria via porins

    Binds to 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and inhibits the translation of the polypeptide chain from A site to P site catalysed by peptidyl transfer
    
    This blocks movement of the peptidyl tRNA from acceptor site to donor site
    
    Therefore, the next tRNA cannot bind to the preoccupied acceptor site, preventing the ribosome from moving along the mRNA to expose the next codon
    
    This inhibits protein synthesis
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    Cf: [[Mechanism of Action Macrolides - YouTube - Elsevier India\|Mechanism of Action Macrolides - YouTube - Elsevier India]]

### Tetracycline

- **Antibacterial activity of tetracycline**
    
    Bacteriostatic
    
- **MOA of tetracycline**
    
    Tetracycline binds to the acceptor site on 30s subunit of ribosome
    
    This blocks the binding of amino-acyl tRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex
