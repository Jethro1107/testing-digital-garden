### Osteoclast

Osteoclasts are bone macrophages, large, multinuclear cells derived from the fusion of the circulating monocytes (macrophage-phagocyte system).

- ******************************************************************************************************************Morphology of osteoclast determines osteoclastic activity******************************************************************************************************************
    
    Osteoclasts have ruffled borders at the surface facing bone matrix, which increase surface area for osteoclastic activities.
    
    Surrounding the ruffled border, is a clear cytoplasmic zone that provides a microenvironment for osteolytic activities.
    
    At the subcellular pocket, the osteoclast secret acid that enables degradation of calcium hydroapatite crystals, collagenase and other proteolytic enzymes for the breakdown of type 1 collagen.
