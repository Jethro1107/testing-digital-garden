### Potential treatment for DMD requires restoration of dystrophin levels in skeletal muscle fibres

Curing DMD requires somehow restoration of normal dystrophin levels in skeletal muscle fibres (and cardiac muscle fibres). This can potentially be done via gene therapy or cell therapy.

### Possibilities of gene therapy of DMD

Gene therapy is possible by either gene-editing (i.e. CRISPR), or introduction of a good dystrophin gene to skeletal muscle fibres and cardiac muscles fibres.

- ******************************************************************************************There may be difficulties in introduction of good genes as:******************************************************************************************
    1. Dystrophin gene is a large gene, and cannot be carried with a viral vector.
    2. Viral vector may trigger an immune response.
    3. We are unable to ensure that all fibres receive the gene
    4. We are unable to prevent the gene from being introduced to other cells.
    5. We are unable to regulate expression of the gene to the right level.

### Possibilities of cell therapy of DMD

Myofibril transfer and induced pluripotent stem cell therapy may be possible cell therapies for DMD.
