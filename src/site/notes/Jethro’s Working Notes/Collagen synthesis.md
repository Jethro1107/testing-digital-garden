### Collagen synthesis (Type 1)

Collagen synthesis starts intracellularly, with the transcription and translation of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, forming alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains ([[Specific amino acid sequences of collagen determines its helical structure\|Specific amino acid sequences of collagen determines its helical structure]]).

- **The Alpha-1 and alpha-2 chains are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum, where procollagen is assembled:**
    - There is association of the C-propeptide, followed by helix folding from the C-terminal to N-terminal (in a zipper-like fashion)
    - Simutaneously, post-translational modification of the chains occurs in the regions where helix folding has not occured. These include:
        - Hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, where [[Vitamin C is necessary for proline hydroxylation during collagen synthesis\|Vitamin C is necessary for proline hydroxylation during collagen synthesis]].
            - Proline hydroxylation enables formation of intramolecular H bonds, which promotes helical stability
            - Lysine hydroxylation enables formation of intermolecular cross-links, and glycosylation of lysine residues.
        - Glycosylation of lysine residues
    - The speed at which helix folding occurs determines the degree of post-translational modification.

Once procollagen is assembled, it is processed in the Golgi apparatus, and is secreted into the extracellular matrix.

- **Collagen assembly also occurs extracellularly:**
    - Procollagen undergoes proteolytic processing, with the cleavage of the C-propeptide and N-propeptide, leaving the collagenous domain (triple helix).
    - Collagen molecules then assemble into fibrils
        - Collagen molecules aggregate and organise into fibrils by formation of covalent cross-links at lysine residues.
        - This is catalysed by peptidyl lysine oxidase, which requires oxygen and Cu2+.
