### Joints of the vertebral arch are synovial joints

Vertebral arches of adjacent vertebrae articulate via the articular facets of superior and inferior articular processes.

They are synovial plane joints that enable gliding movements. The range of motion afforded depends on the orientation of the facet joints, the different orientation enables different movements in different regions.
