### Pathogenesis and pathology of osteoarthritis

- ************************************************************Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis************************************************************
    
    Abnormal loading at the joint (either by overloading or underloading), interfers with the nutrient cycle of the articular cartilage, as [[Nutrient cycle of the articular cartilage requires mechanical loading at the joint\|Nutrient cycle of the articular cartilage requires mechanical loading at the joint]].
    
    - Underloading of the joint results in insufficient pressure to push synovial fluid into the joints, resulting in poor chondrocyte nutrition.
    - Overloading of the joint cause direct death of chondrocytes.
    
    With a disruption in nutrient cycle of articular cartilage, it results in destabilized cartilage homeostasis/ [[Jethro’s Working Notes/ECM homeostasis\|ECM homeostasis]]: Osteoarthritis starts when the degradation exceeds synthesis of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cartilage matrix\|Cartilage matrix]]. Hence, a defining feature of [[Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)\|Osteoarthritis (Degenerative joint [[disorder)]]]], is the loss of articular cartilage, and radiologically presents with joint space narrowing ([[Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of osteoarthritis\|Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of osteoarthritis]]).
    
    ****************************************************************************************Changes in articular cartilage****************************************************************************************
    
    Degradation of articular cartilage exceeds synthesis of cartilage matrix. Stromolysin (MMP) breaks down type II collagen, which results in loss of collagen framework to restrict the swelling of the HA-aggrecan aggregates, resulting in entry of water into the cartilage, resulting in [[soft and swollen articular cartilage during proping in [[arthscopy.\|soft and swollen articular cartilage during proping in [[arthscopy.]]]]
    
    As degeneration of the cartilage matrix continues, it results in [[fibrillation, cracks and [[erosions.\|fibrillation, cracks and [[erosions.]]]]
    
    Eventually, there is loss of articular cartilage to the subchondral bone, resulting in eburnation.
    
    ******************************Changes in subchondral bone******************************
    
    Loss of articular cartilage results in abnormal loading onto the bone:
    
    - In response to abnormal load onto the bone, bone remodelling occurs to stabilize the joint.
    - Osteophytes form at joint margins, and subchondral sclerosis occurs
    - High stress on the bones, may cause the bones to crack. Fluid may move into the bone to form subchondral cyst.
- ****************************************************************Histopathology of osteoarthritis****************************************************************
    
    There is a progressive loss of articular cartilage, with fibrillations, cracks and eroision of cartilage.

    In severe OA, eburnation (complete loss of articular cartilage) occurs.
