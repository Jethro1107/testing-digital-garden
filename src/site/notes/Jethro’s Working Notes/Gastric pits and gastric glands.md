### Gastric pits and gastric glands

The simple columnar epithelium of the stomach invaginates into the lamina to form **gastric pits**, which form branched tubular glands (**gastric glands**) that extend throughout the thickness of the lamina propria.

- **The gastric pits and gastric glands consist of 5 functional cell types:**
    - **Surface mucous cells**
        
        The surface mucous cells line the surface of the stomach and the gastric pits.
        
        Histologically, they appear as a typical mucous-secreting cell, i.e. columnar, *nucleus at base* and a *pale-staining mucous cap* consisting of mucinogen granules.

        They **secret highly alkali insoluble mucous** which lines the stomach, which 1) protects against abrasion, and 2) protects the stomach wall from acidic gastric juice ([[Surface mucous cells and neck mucous cells are involved in the maintenance of a two-layered mucous gel layer\|Surface mucous cells and neck mucous cells are involved in the maintenance of a two-layered mucous gel layer]]).
        
    - **Neck mucous cells**
        
        Neck mucous cells are found in the neck region of the gland, they can be considered as the immature precursors of surface mucous cell.
        
        Histologically, they appear in clusters, or as single cells which assume the appearance of a typical mucous-secreting cells, i.e. round nuclei at base and a pale-staining apical mucous cap.

        They release less alkali mucous.
        
    - **Parietal (oxyntic) cells**
        
        Parietal oxyntic cells are found in the neck region of the gland.
        
        Histologically, they assume ‘fried-egg’ appearance, large, round cell with centrally located nucleus and highly eosinophilic cytoplasm (as a result of abundant mitochondria.

        They function to release hydrochloric acid and gastric intrinsic factor.
        
        Parietal cell secretory activity is stimulated both by parasympathetic innervation and by paracrine release of histamine and the polypeptide **gastrin**
         from enteroendocrine cells ([[The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine\|The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine]]).
        
    - **Features of chief (zymogenic) cells**
        
        Chief cells are located mainly at the base region of the glands
        
        Histologically, chief cells assume the typical phenotype of a protein-secreting cell, i.e. basophilic at the basal region (due to abundant rER) and eosinophilic at the apical region (due to presence of zymogen granules).

        Chief cells function to release pepsinogen (and gastric lipase).
        
    - **Enteroendocrine cells**
        
        Enteroendocrine cells are located mainly at the basal regions of the glands.
        
        Histologically, they are unable to identify under routine H&E staining, but can be identified under silver staining.
        
        Enteroendocrine glands function to release hormones and neurotransmitters.
