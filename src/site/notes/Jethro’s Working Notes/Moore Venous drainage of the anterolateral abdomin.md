# Moore: Venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall

****Vessels of Anterolateral Abdominal Wall****

The skin and subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall are served by an intricate subcutaneous venous plexus, draining superiorly to the internal thoracic vein medially and the lateral thoracic vein laterally and inferiorly to the superficial and inferior epigastric veins, tributaries of the femoral and external iliac veins, respectively (Fig. 5.11). Cutaneous veins surrounding the umbilicus anastomose with *para-umbilical* veins, small tributaries of the *hepatic portal vein* that parallel the *obliterated umbilical vein* (round ligament of the liver). A relatively direct lateral superficial anastomotic channel, the **thoraco-epigastric vein**, may exist or develop (as a result of altered venous flow) between the *superficial epigastric vein* (a femoral vein tributary) and the *lateral thoracic vein* (an axillary vein tributary). The deeper veins of the anterolateral abdominal wall accompany the arteries, bearing the same name. A deeper, medial venous anastomosis may exist or develop between the *inferior epigastric vein* (an external iliac vein tributary) and the *superior epigastric/internal thoracic veins* (subclavian vein tributaries). The superficial and deep anastomoses may afford collateral circulation during blockage of either vena cava.
