### Ankle inversion and eversion injuries

Inversion and eversion injuries occur at the [[Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex\|Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex]] complex]].

Inversion injuries can cause sprain of calcaneofibular ligament, avulsion of lateral malleolus (if the ligament does not snap), or push fracture of the medial malleolus.

Eversion injuries can cause avulsion of medial malleolus or push fracture of lateral malleolus. Medial ligament rupture is rare as it is very strong.
