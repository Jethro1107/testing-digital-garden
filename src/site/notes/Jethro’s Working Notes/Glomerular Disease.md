### Classification of glomerular diseases by etiology

| Primary glomerulonephritis/ nephropathies | Systemic Diseases With Glomerular Involvement | Hereditary Disorders |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Membranous nephropathy | Systemic lupus erythematosus | Alport syndrome |
| Minimal change disease | Goodpasture syndrome | Thin basement membrane nephropathy |
| Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis | Diabetes mellitus | Fabry disease |
| Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis | Amyloidosis |  |
| Dense deposit disease | Microscopic polyarteritis/polyangiitis |  |
| IgA nephropathy | Granulomatosis with polyangiitis |  |
| • Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis

    ◦ Postinfectious
    ◦ Other | Henoch-Schönlein purpura |  |
| Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis |  |  |

### **Pathogenesis of glomerular injury**

- Mediated by immune mechanisms
    
    Mediated by immune complexes (more common)
    
    Glomerular injury may be caused by immune complex in situ, which can be either due to binding of antibody to intrinsic glomerular antigens, or the binding of antibody to normal component of glomerular basement membrane
    
    Binding to intrinsic glomerular antigen - membrane nephropathy (Autoantibodies binding to M-type phospholipase A2 receptors, PLA2R)
    
    Binding to normal components of GBM - Goodpasture syndrome, also known as Anti-GBM-mediated crescentic glomerulonephritis (Autoantibodies binding to Type IV collagen in GBM)
    
    Glomerular injury may also be caused by deposition of circulating immune complexes
    
    Immune complexes may be endogenous, e.g. Systemic lupus erythromatous / SLE,
    
    or exogenous, e.g. bacterial products (GAS/ streptococcal dysgalactiae), viral (Hepatitis B), parasitic (Plasmodium falciparum) or spirochetal (Treponema pallidum)
    
    Mediated by other immune mechanisms (less common):
    
    Progression of glomerular diseases may be due to cell mediated immunity (demonstrated by the presence of macrophages and T lymphocytes)
    
    Glomerular diseases may also be caused by excessive activation of alternative complement pathways:
    
    Dense deposit disease
    
    C3 glomerulonephritis

    - **How does immune mechanisms cause glomerular injury?**
        1. Epithelial cell/ podocyte injury
            
            Podocyte injury can be induced by various immune mechanisms (e.g. antibody binding to podocyte antigen)
            
            Podocyte injury is characterised by effacement of pedicles, vacuolization, retraction and detatchment of podocyte from glomerular basement membrane

            This results in the loss of filtration slits, and often results in the development of proteinuria
            
        2. Glomerular injury
            
            As a result of immune related injury, this results in the decrease in number of functional glomeruli that causes the reduction of GFR
            
            This may result in compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining functional glomeruli in response to the loss of glomeruli
            
            These compensatory changes are maladaptive and leads to further podocyte and glomerular injury, resulting in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
            
            Glomerulosclerosis further reduces the number of functional gloeruli, thus initiating the viscious cycle of progressive glomerulosclerosis
            
- Metabolic alterations of GBM
- Genetic defects of GBM synthesis and cellular proteins

### **Possible effects of glomerular injury**

Proteinuria

Haematuria

Decrease in glomerular blood flow

Decrease in glomerular filtration rate

If irreversible damage is dealt, it results in chronic kidney disease and eventually end stage renal disease

### **Glomerular disease classified by clinical manifestation**

| Nephrotic syndrome | Nephritic Syndrome | Acute Kidney Injury |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Membranous nephropathy | Acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis | Rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis |
| Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis | IgA Nephropathy |  |
| Minimal Change Disease |  |  |
| Focal Segmental glomerulonephritis |  |  |
