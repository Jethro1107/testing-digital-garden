### Pepsinogen is an inactive zymogen released by chief cells

Pepsinogen is an inactive zymogen released by gastric chief cells. It is a single polypeptide chain consisting of an activation (masking) peptide and the active pepsin.

- **Action of pepsin:**
    
    Upon activation (when cleaved into pepsin by gastric acid), it serves as an endopeptidase that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides.
    
    It targets *neutral amino acids with aromatic or large aliphatic side chains*.
    
- **Pepsin operates within a narrow pH:**
    
    It is active in acidic pH, and becomes irreversibly inactive (denatured) at pH7-8 or above.

- **Pepsin is activated via 2 mechanisms:**
    1. Pepsin is activated by gastric acid
    2. **Autocatalysis** - Pepsin, being a proteolytic enzyme, can cleave pepsinogen into pepsin
