### Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of osteoarthritis

The classification of osteoarthritis by radiological assessment is proposed by *Kallgren and Lawrence* in 1957. The following radiological features are regarded as evidence of osteoarthritis:

- Joint space narrowing
- Marginal osteophyte formation
- Subchondral bone sclerosis
- Subchondral bone cysts
- Deformities of bone ends (bony contour changes)

The original description for the classification of osteoarthritis is as below:

- Stage 0 - Definite absence of x-ray changes of osteoarthritis
- Grade 1 (Doubtful) - Doubtful narrowing of joint spaces and possible osteophytic lipping
- Grade 2 (minimal) - Definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing
- Grade 3 (moderate) - Moderate, multiple osteophyte, with definite joint space narrowing, some sclerosis and possible deformities of bone ends
- Grade 4 (severe) - Large osteophytes, marked joint space narrowing, severe sclerosis and definite deformities of bone ends

Grade 2 radiological findings can be used to deem the presence of osteoarthritis.
