### Secretory vesicles in pancreatic acinar cells are highly acidified to complete a negative feedback loop

Secretory granules in pancreatic acinar cells are acidified due to the presence of vesicular H+ ATPase, which pumps H+ into the secretory vesicles at the expense of ATP. Hence, pancreatic acinar cells produce a H+ rich fluid.

- **Physiological significance of the acidified secretory vesicles**
    
    Stimulation of enzyme secretion by pancreatic acinar cells is mediated by Ca2+ intracellular signalling pathway (an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels). Hence, the cessation enzyme secretion requires the removal of intracellular Ca2+.
    
    When H+ is secreted into acinar lumen with the digestive enzymes, it results in a decrease in luminal pH, and activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), which pumps out Ca2+ in exchange for luminal H+.
