### Chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy in epiphyseal plate is regulated by the IHH/PTHrP negative feedback loop

IHH/PTHrP negative feedback loop regulates the ratio between proliferating chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Epiphyseal plate\|Epiphyseal plate]], which ultimately regulate bone growth by [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Endochondral ossification\|Endochondral ossification]].

    Indian Hedgehog (IHH) expression is restricted in prehypertrophic chondrocytes in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Epiphyseal plate\|Epiphyseal plate]], when chondrocytes leave the cell cycle and start to hypertrophy.
    
    IHH has 2 effects:
    
    - A short range effect: Where it stimulates chondrocyte ossification in the zone of proliferating cartilage
    - A long range effect: Where it stimulates Parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP) in the articular cartilage
    
    PTHrP eventually diffuse back to the epiphyseal plate, where it binds to PTH-1R on prehypertrophic chondrocyte to inhibit chondrocyte hypertrophy, which subsequently reduces IHH expression in these cells.

- ********************************************************************************************The IHH/PTHrP is described as a negative feedback mechanism at 2 levels********************************************************************************************
    
    ****************************************************************A negative feedback mechanism that regulates expression of IHH.****************************************************************
    
    When prehypertrophic chondrocytes express IHH, it triggers the release of PTHrP in the articular cartilage, which inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy to reduce their expression of IHH.
    
    ****************************************************************************************************************************A negative feedback mechanism that balances the ratio of Proliferating chondrocytes and hypertrophy.****************************************************************************************************************************
    
    When the **ratio of proliferating chondrocytes to hypertrophic chondrocytes decrease** (increase number of hypertrophic chondrocytes), it results in increase in expression of IHH.
    
    This results in a short-range effect of increasing chondrocyte proliferation, and a long-range effect of stimulating PTHrP release, which results in inhibition of chondrocyte hypertrophy. Thus, **increasing the ratio of proliferating chondrocytes to hypertrophic chondrocytes**.
