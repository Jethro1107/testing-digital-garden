### Pulmonary hypertension

- **Diagnosis criteria for pulmonary hypertension**
    
    Mean pulmonary arterial preasure (MPAP) greater than 25mmHg at rest measured by right heart catheterization
    
    To put it into context, normal pulmonary systolic pressure ranges from 15-30mmHg, and normla pulmonary diastolic pressure ranges from 4-12mmHg, and normal mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) is ≤20mmHg
    
- **Consequences of pulmonary hypertension**
    
    Right heart failure and death
    
- Pulmonary artery wedge pressure
    - **What is pulmonary artery wedge pressure?**
        
        An estimate of left atrial pressure/left ventricular end diastolic pressure
        
    - **Classification of pulmonary hypertension by pulmonary artery wedge pressure**
        
        Precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PAWP ≤ 15mmHg)
        
        Postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (PAWP > 15mmHg)
        

### Clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension (**WHO classification)**

- Group 1
    - **What is group 1 pulmonary hypertension?**
        
        Pulmonary arterial hypertension, due to diseases affecting **small pulmonary muscular arterioles**
        
    - **Eitiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension**
        - Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
            - **What is idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension?**
                
                Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a form of PAH with no triggers found, clinically indistinguishable from heriditary PAH
                
            - **Epidemiology of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension**
                
                Rare disease - 2-5 people per 1 million people, but is increasingly being diagnosed in elderly people
                
                Often affecting young people - mean age is 45 years old
                
        - Hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension
            - **Epidemiology of hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension**
                
                6-10% of patients with Group 1 have hereditary PAH

        - Connective tissue disease
            - **Common connective tissue disease/autoimmune disease causing Group 1 pulmonary hypertension**
                
                Systemic scleroris (Scleroderma)
                
                Rheumatoid arthritis
                
                Systemic lupus erythromatous (SLE)
                
            - **Pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension via connective tissue disease**
                
                Autoimmune diseases cause fibrous obliteration/narrowing of the pulmonary vasculature bed, causing an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
                
        - HIV
            - **Epidemiology of HIV and Group I pulmonary hypertension**
                
                1 in 200 HIV-infected patients develop PAH, which is a higher prevalence than the general population

                        Prostacyclin analogues bind to prostacyclin receptors, activating adenyl cyclase
                        
                        This results in elevated cAMP and thus activation of PKA, phosphorylating MLCK and SERCA, causing relaxation of VSMC and vasodilation
