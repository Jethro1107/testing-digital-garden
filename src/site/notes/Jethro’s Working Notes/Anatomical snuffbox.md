### Anatomical snuffbox

The anatomical snuff box is a triangular depression on the dorsolateral side of the hand, near the base of the thumb. Its lateral borders is formed by the tendons of the flexor abductor pollicus longus and the extensor pollicus brevis ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior compartment of the forearm\|Posterior compartment of the forearm]]). The medial border is formed by the tendon of the extensor pollicus longus.

The base of the anatomical snuffbox is formed by the scaphoid and trapezium, which can be clinically significant, as in ulnar deviation (adduction of the wrist), they may be palpated for fractures.

********************The radial artery crosses the tendons of the abductor pollicus longus******************** and *************************extensor pollicus brevis,************************* and reappears in the anatomical snuff box.

********************************************************Terminal parts of the superfical branch of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Radial nerve\|Radial nerve]], lie over the anatomical snuffbox.**
