### Antacids

- **Examples of antacids**
    
    Sodium bicarbonate, Calcium carbonate, Combination of magnesium and aluminium hydroxide (most commonly used nowadays)
    
- **MOA of antacids**
    
    Antacids neutralize gastric acids.
    
- **Adverse effects of antacids**
    
    Sodium bicarbonate:
    
    - Belching (due to CO2 produced)
    - Fluid retention in individuals with heart failure, renal insufficiency, hypertension etc. (Due to hypernatremia)
    
    Calcium carbonate:
    
    - Belching (due to CO2 produced)
    - Hypercalcaemia
    - Renal calculi (due to hypercalcemia)
    - Constipation
    
    Magnesium and aluminium hydroxide:
    
    - Magnesium hydroxide causes diarrhoea while aluminium hydroxide causes constipation, such that they are usually administered together.
    - Both are poorly absorbed, such that there are rarely systemic effects.
