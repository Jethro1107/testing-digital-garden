### Tuberculosis

- Mycobacteria
    - **What is mycobacteria?**
        
        Mycobacterium is a structurally gram positive non mobile, non spore-forming bacilli
        
    - **Gram stain properties of mycobacteria**
        
        Not stained by gram stain (due to high lipid content of mycobacterium cell wall), but is structurally gram positive
        
    - **Staining properties of mycobacteria**
        
        An acid fast bacilli - able to resist acid alcohol decolourisation during Ziehl-Neelsen stain

    - **Structure of mycobacterium cell wall and its significance**
        
        High lipid content (60% of cell wall weight) - Mycolic acid, Mycosides, sulpholipids, cord factor
        
        Significance:
        
        Determines staining reactions
        
        Determines penetration of antibiotics (most antibiotics are hydrophilic, and thus cannot penetrate)
        
    - **Susceptibility to physical and chemical agents of mycobacterium**
        
        Same degree of susceptability to heat and UV light as other non spore forming bacteria
        
        More resistant to drying, acid, alkali and chemical disinfectants
        
        Susceptible to intermediate to high level disinfectants:
        
        Phenolics
        
        Sodium hypochlorite
        
        Aldehydes (Glutaldehyde, Formaldehyde)
        
        Ethylene oxide
        
        70% ethanol
        
    - **Classification of mycobacterium**
        
        Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
        
        Mycobacterium leprae
        
        Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)/Mycobacterium other than tubercle bacilli (MOTT) - Classified into slow growers and rapid growers (on culture)

### Influenza

- Influenza virus
    - **What is influenza virus?**
        
        An enveloped, segmented RNA virus causing influenza
        
    - **Classification of influenza virus**
        
        Influenza A, B, C, D
        
    - **Structure of influenza virus (Influenza A and influenza B)**
        
        Influenza virus consist of the nucleocapsid, and an additional layer of covering, the envelope
        
        Nucleocapsid - 8 segmented ssRNA, RNA polymerase, nucleoproteins
        
        Envelope - matrix proteins, Haemagglutinin (HA, H), neuramidase (NA, N)
        
    - **Antigenic structures and virulence factors of influenza virus**
        
        Haemagglutinin:
        
        18 types
        
        Mediates attachment and cell entry
        
        Neuramidase:
        
        11 types
        
        Mediates cell exit, release and spread of virus
        
    - **2 types of antigenic variation in influenza A**
        
        
        Antigenic drift - involves relatively minor mutations in HA or NA genes that occur frequently within an influenza subtype
        
        Drives seasonal epidemics, necessitating global year-round influenza surveillance and annual update of influenza virus
        
        Antigenic shift - involves major mutations in HA or NA genes that results in a new HA or NA
        
        Potential to cause pandemics
        
    - **Common human influenza A virus subtypes**
        
        Common subtypes circulating in humans are H1N1 and H3N2, where H1N2 and H2N2 are rare
        
        Note, the common antigens circulating among humans are H1, H2, H3, and N1, N2
        
    - **Animal influenza A viruses known to cause human infections**
        
        H3N2, H1N1
        
        Both from swine
        
    - **Avian influenza A viruses known to cause human infections**
        
        H5N1, H7N9 are notable ones, many more
