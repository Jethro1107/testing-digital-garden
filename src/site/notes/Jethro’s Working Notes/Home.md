### About these notes

Hi, I’m Jethro. You’ve now stumbled upon my working notes ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Home\|]]). Inspired by [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Andy Matuschak\|Andy Matuschak]] ‘s theory on knowledge work (particularly on [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Working with the garage door open\|Working with the garage door open]]), I have decided to open the gates to my thinking environment.

I assume most of you who access my notes are in hopes of reading my notes for MBBS. I will tag all MBBS notes with `Medicine` and according to the corresponding blocks. My notes are concept-oriented, rather than lecture oriented(classified into anatomy concepts, physiology concepts, disease syndromes, clinical skills, ethics etc.) Hopefully this will be different perspective of understanding our preclinical syllabus. Below are the medicine related notes I’m working on:

- Medicine:
    - `MSS` Block hit me like a truck:
        - Almost done with notes on the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the upper limb\|Anatomy of the upper limb]], was able to identify structures in the arm and forearm during dissection, not so much in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axilla\|Axilla]].
        - Hopefully can finish notes on [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the lower limb\|Anatomy of the lower limb]]
        - MSS dissection is difficult, as [[Regional anatomy of the limb misses the point, learning anatomy of the limbs by structure reveals its clinical significance\|Regional anatomy of the limb misses the point, learning anatomy of the limbs by structure reveals its clinical significance]].
    - GIS block is here! Notes taken revolving around the block will be tagged with `GIS`
        - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the Abdomen\|Anatomy of the Abdomen]] | [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomy of the Abdominal Wall\|Anatomy of the Abdominal Wall]]
        - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Histology of the GI tract\|Histology of the GI tract]]
        - Gastrointestinal physiology (tagged: `GIS` and `Physiology` | [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastric secretions\|Gastric secretions]] | [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Digestive and absorption\|Digestive and absorption]] | [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pancreatic secretions\|Pancreatic secretions]] | [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biliary secretion\|Biliary secretion]] | [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Fluid movement in the intestine\|Fluid movement in the intestine]] |
    - Improving my understanding of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Respiratory anatomy\|Respiratory anatomy]], the need for such refinement is demonstrated in the summative assessment
    - Learning about [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Respiratory Examination\|Respiratory Examination]], preparing for OSCE examination
    - Learning about [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cardiovascular Examination\|Cardiovascular Examination]], preparing for OSCE examination
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Blood Pressure Measurement\|Blood Pressure Measurement]]

    - Been playing a lot of [[snooker\|snooker]] and pool lately, total newbie though
