### Bones of the hand

The bones of the hand include:

- The 8 carpals, forming the bones of the wrists;
- The 5 metacarpals, forming the bones of the metacarpus; and
- The Phalanges, forming the bones of the digits - 2 in the thumb (proximal and dista) and 3 in the rest of the digit. Each phalanges has a base, a shaft and distally, a head.

- **The 8 carpals are arranged in 2 rows**
    
    Proceeding laterally to medially:
    
    In the proximal row, the scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, and pisiform. The pisiform sits on top of the triquetral.
    
    In the distal row, the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and halmate.

    Note the presence of the tubercle of scaphoid and the tubercle of trapezium on the radial side, as well as the hook of halmate and the elevated pisiform on the ulnar side. They accentuate the concavity of the carpal arch (distal transverse arch).
