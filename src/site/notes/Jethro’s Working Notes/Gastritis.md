### Acute gastritis

- **Acute gastritis and its etiologies**
    
    Acute gastritis is the acute inflammation of the stomach resulting from mucosal injury, defined by the presence of neutrophils and its transient course.
    
    There are a number of etiologies of acute gastritis: NSAID, heavy alcohol consumption, heaving smoking, severe physiological stress (e.g. burns, extensive surgery, stroke).
    
- **Clinical features of acute gastritis**
    
    Acute gastritis may be assymptomatic, but may be present with varying degrees of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. 
    
    In more severe cases, they can give rise to bleeding (hematemesis, melena etc).
    
- **Histopathology of acute gastritis**
    
    There is neutrophilic infiltration into the gastric mucosa.

### Chronic gastritis

- **Etiologies of chronic gastritis**
    
    There are two etiologies of chronic gastritis: 1) [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Helicobacter pylori\|Helicobacter pylori]] gastritis and 2) Autoimmune gastritis.
    
- **Histopathology of chronic gastritis**
    
    There are chronic inflammatory cells, i.e. lymphocytes and plasma cells.
    
    In cases of ‘active’ chronic gastritis, neutrophils are mixed with the chronic inflammatory cells.
