### The carrying angle is visible when the elbow is fully extended and the forearm is in supination

The carrying angle (165-175 degrees) is the visible angle of the longitudinal axis of the arm and forearm when the elbow is full extended and the forearm is in supination. 

Probably derived from evolution, it permits the forearm to clear the hips when carrying an object. It is more pronounced in women as they may have wider hips.

The carrying angle will disappear when the forearm is in pronation.
