# Jugular venous pressure

### What is jugular venous pressure?

The two vessels that are assessed in the neck area are the carotid arteries and the jugular vein. The jugular vein reveals right heart function (where the carotid arteries reveal the left heart function).

### Clinical skills - Assessing the jugular venous pressure

Positioning and lighting is important for assessing the jugular venous pressure.

**Positioning the patient**

The patient lies at 45 degrees (By having the patient lying at a 45 degree angle, the base of the neck is roughly aligned with the sternal angle).

The patient turns his head slightly to the left to expose the base of the neck. However, if the patientâ€™s head is turned too much, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is contracted and obscure the view.

**Assessing jugular venous pressure**

The JVP is assessed for its height and character.

1. Height
    
    The height of JVP is determined by the vertical distance between the highest point of JVP pulsation and the sternal angle, then adding 5cm (The vertical distance between the sternal angle and the right atrium is roughly 5cm). Normal JVP
    
2. Character
    
    A normal JVP waveform has a bifid flickering character, i.e. it has 2 pulses within one cardiac cycle ([[Guyton and Hall  Atrial a, c and p wave\|Guyton and Hall  Atrial a, c and p wave]] ):
    
    An A wave and a V wave
    

Abnormal height and character underlie certain cardiac problems (Cf: [[$ Talley  Causes of change in jugular venous pressure height and character\|$ Talley  Causes of change in jugular venous pressure height and character]])
