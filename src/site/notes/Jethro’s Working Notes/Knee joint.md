### Knee joint

The knee joint is one of the largest and most comlex synovial joint in the body. It involves two articulations, the patellofemoral joint, and the tibiofemoral joint.

The patellofemoral joint is the articulation between the articular facets of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Patella\|Patella]] and the patellar surface of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femur\|Femur]].

The tibiofibular joint includes two articular surfaces:

- The lateral and medial femoral condyles
- The superior aspect of the lateral and medial tibial condyles

It should be noted that the articular surfaces of femoral condyles is round when the knee joint is flexed, and becomes flat when the knee joint is in full extension.

- **Menisci**
    
    The lateral meniscus and medial meniscus are O and C-shaped cartilages which improve the congruency of the articular surface during joint movement.
    
    The anterior and posterior intercondylar horns attach to the intercondylar area.
    
- **Synovial cavity and bursa of the knee joint**
    
    The knee joint has an extensive synovial cavity that communicates with many bursas:
    
    - Suprapatellar bursa
    - Prepatellar bursa (subcutaneous)
    - Deep infrapatellar bursa
    - Subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa
    
    Bursitis commonly occurs in the prepatellar and infrapatellar bursas (especially when kneeling a lot).
    
    Note that joint effusions due to underlying joint pathologies can enter these bursas, causing the whole knee to swell up.
    
- **Stabilization of the knee joint**
    
    The knee joint is intrinsically an unstable joint due to incongruous articular surface between the femoral and tibial condyles.
    
    Stability is largely determined by the muscle tone of the quadriceps femoris muscle (a dynamic stabilization factor).
    
    Stability is also offered by two strong paired ligaments:
    
    - Collateral ligaments offer side to side stability (preventing abduction and adduction).
        
        The fibular (lateral) collateral ligament (intrinsic ligament) is a cord-like ligament that attaches proximally to the lateral femoral epicondyle, and distally to the head of the fibula.
        
        The tibial (medial) collateral ligament is a broad intrinsic ligament that is a thickened part of the joint capsule. It attaches proximally from the medial femoral epicondyle and attaches distally to the medial tibial epicondyle, it also attaches to the medial meniscus.

    - Cruciate ligament offer anteroposterior stability.
        
        *Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) *****attaches to the anterior compartment of the intercondylar space of the tibia and ascends posteriorly to attach to the lateral wall of the intercondylar fossa (lateral condyle). It prevents the anterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur.
        
        *Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)* attaches to the posterior compartment of the intercondylar space of the tibia and ascends anteriorly to attach to the medial wall of the intercondylar fossa (medial condyle). It prevents the posterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur.

- **Locking mechanism of the knee reduces energy required for muscle work to maintain a standing position**
    
    The knee is locked when fully extended, which is achieved in 2 mechanisms:
    
    1. When extended, the articular surface of the femoral condyles is flat, which increase the surface area for better stabilization.
    2. Screw home rotation (passive rotation) of the femur relative to the tibia tightens all associate ligaments, this locks the knee joint in position.
    
    Unlocking the knee joint requires lateral rotation of the femur enabled by the popliteus muscle.

- **Movement of the knee joint**
    
    Principally, the knee joint enables flexion and extension.
    
    However, when flexed, the knee joint is least stable, due to the round articular surface of the femoral condyles and the lax ligaments, hence, this enables lateral and medial rotation of the tibia with respect with the the fibula.
