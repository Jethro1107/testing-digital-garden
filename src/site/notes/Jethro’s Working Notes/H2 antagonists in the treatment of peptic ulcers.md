### H2 antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcers

- **Examples of H2 antagonists**
    
    From increasing potency and duration of action: Cimetidine, Ranitidine, Nizatidine, Famotidine.
    
- **MOA of H2 antagonists**
    
    H2 antagonists binds to and inhibits H2 receptors on parietal cells, preventing stimulation of gastric acid secretion via histamine release by ECL cells.
    
    This reduces cAMP levels, preventing the activation of H+/K+ ATPase.
    
    Referring to the concept of potentiation, histamine antagonists can inhibit 60% of acid secretion.

- **Adverse effects of H2 antagonists**
    
    H2 antagonists are generally well tolerated.
    
    Mild side effects of H2 antagonists include GI disturbance (e.g. constipation, diarrhea), headaches and dizziness.
    
    For **cimetidine**, it inhibits the binding of dihydrotestosterone (physiologically active form of testosterone) to androgen receptors, resulting in impotence and gynecomastia (irregular increase in breast tissue in men).
    
- **Drug interactions of H2 antagonists**
    
    H2 antagonists are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 in the liver. This results in decreased metabolism of other drugs (e.g. phenytoin, theophylline and warfarin), resulting in increased drug plasma levels and increased adverse effects (drug toxicity).
    
    Cimetidine is a stronger inhibitor of cytochrome P450 than other H2 antagonists, and is thus avoided in patients receiving other medication.
