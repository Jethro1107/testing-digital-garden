### Genicular anastamosis

Genicular anastamosis is an arterial anastamosis over the knee. It is contributed by the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femoral artery\|Femoral artery]], deep femoral artery, [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Popliteal artery\|Popliteal artery]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterior tibial artery\|Anterior tibial artery]] and  [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior tibial artery\|Posterior tibial artery]].

This creates collateral blood supply that maintains arterial supply to the leg and foot when the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Popliteal artery\|Popliteal artery]] is blocked.
