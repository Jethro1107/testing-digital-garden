## Concept of Nutrition

- Defining Nutritional Science and Nutrition
    - What is Nutritional Science?
        
        Nutritional Science - The study of food and nutrients in relation to health and diseases, and the process by which an organism ingests, absorbs, transports, utilizes and excretes food
        
        Nutritional Science is not food science, just a component of it
        
    - What is nutrition?
        
        Nutrition is the process by which an organism **I**ngests, **A**bsorbs (digestion, transport, assimilation) and e**X**cretes and **M**etabolizes food (IAXM)
        
- Why do we care about Nutrition?
    
    Nutrients provide energy and building blocks for our body
    
    Poor diet is a risk factor for chronic diseases
    
- 3 ways of classifying nutrients
    - By biochemical properties
        1. Carbohydrates
        2. Lipids
        3. Proteins
        4. Minerals 
        5. Vitamins
        6. Dietary Fibre
        7. Water
    - Essential vs Non-essential
        - What are essential nutrients?
            
            Essential nutrients - Substances that must be obtained from our diet because the body either cannot synthesize them or can synthesize them but in insufficient quantities to meet its needs
            
            Includes: essential fatty acids, essential amino acids, minerals, vitamins, water, dietary fibres
            
        - What are non-essential nutrients?
            
            Non-essential nutrients - Substances that is not required in the diet as the body can synthesize them in sufficient quantities to meet its needs
            
            Includes: non-essential fatty acids, non-essential amino acids, carbohydrates (except dietary fibres)
            
    - Macro vs micronutrients
        - What are macronutrients?
            
            Macronutrients - Nutrients needed in large amounts (g)
            
            Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water
            
        - What are micronutrients?
            
            Micronutrients - Nutrients needed in small amounts (mg, μg)
            
            Vitamins, Minerals
            
- Concept of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)
    - What is Dietary Reference Intake?
        
        DRI - A set of nutrient reference values that include Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL), and Adequate Intake (AI)
        
        Such reference values are based on the normal distribution of nutrient requirement
        
    - The 4 reference values
        - What is Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)?
            
            Intake level sufficient to satisfy the nutritional needs of 50% of the population
            
        - What is Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA)?
            
            Intake level sufficient to satisfy the nutritional needs of 97.5% of the population
            
        - What is Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL)?
            
            Highest Intake level that is safe for 97.5% of the population
            
        - What is Adequate Intake (AI)?
            
            Intake level believed to be adequate for everyone
            
            Only used with insufficient data
            

## Nutrition energy

- Energy Balance and Weight Maintainence
    - How is weight maintained?
        
        When energy intake is greater than energy requirement, weight gain occurs. When energy intake is lower than energy requirement, weight loss occurs.
        
- Energy Requirements
    - What constitutes our energy requirement?
        - Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
            
            A series of functions that are essential for life, e.g basic cell functions, biosynthesis, maintenance of temperature etc.
            
            It constitutes the largest proportion of energy expenditure
            
            - Factors affecting BMR
                - Age
                    
                    Younger → higher BMR
                    
                - Gender
                    
                    Men BMR > Women BMR
                    
                - Bodyweight
                    
                    Heavier → Higher BMR
                    
        - Physical Activity
            
            2nd largest component of daily energy expenditure, but extremely variable
            
            Can be obligatory e.g for work, or discretionary e.g exercise
            
            Obligatory and discretionary depends on whether it meets socio-economical demands
            
        - Metabolic response to food
            
            Increased heat production and oxygen consumption, e.g diet-induced thermogenesis
            
        - Growth
            
            Constitution of energy expenditure decreases with age, and eventually becomes negligible in late teens
            
- Energy Adequacy
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    As we age, energy requirement changes, curve shifts, and thus level of intake to maintain bodyweight changes
    
- Energy Intake Calculations
    - What is the caloric value for Carbohydrates?
        
        4 kcal/g
        
    - What is the caloric value for Lipids?
        
        9 kcal/g
        
    - What is the caloric value of Proteins?
        
        4 kcal/g
        
- Calories in ATP
    - How many calories are there in 1 mol of ATP?
        
        Only including the last phosphoanhydride bond, 7300 calories present
        

## Nutritional Assessment

- What is nutritional assessment?
    
    Nutritional assessment - The process of collecting and evaluating both objective and subjective data related to an individual's nutrient intake, lifestyle and medical history in order to determine the nutritional status of that individual
    
    After determining the nutritional status, interventions can be carried out to improve said status
    
    - Relations to nutritional screening?
        
        Completely different. Nutritional screening is to rapidly identify patients with high nutritional risks
        
- What are the components of nutritional assessment?
    - **A**nthropometric Data
        - What types of Anthropometric data are used?
            
            Body Mass Index, Waist-Hip Ratio, Tricep Skinfold Thickness, Mid-Arm Muscle Circumference
            
        - What are the advantages of such measurements?
            
            Portable, non-invasive, inexpensive, fast
            
            Quick indicators of obesity
            
        - What are the caveats of such measurements?
            
            Subjected to human error
            
        - What is the BMI 'Obesity Paradox'?
            
            Relative risk of total mortality and cardiovascular mortality of people labelled 'Overweight' and 'Obese' is lower than those within normal ranges of BMI
            
            Overweight or Obese are associated with improved survival and fewer cardiovascular incidents
            
            BMI may wrongfully label people as overweight or obese, and must be taken in account with other anthropometric data to determine obesity
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
    - **B**iochemical Data
        - What is biochemical data?
            
            Objective quantitative measurements for establish adequacy for nutrient intake and absorption
            
            Assessments of blood, urine and faeces can be carried out
            
        - What are the caveats of biochemical data?
            
            Results are affected by non-nutritional factors, such as:
            
            Medication, diseases, hydration status, stress etc
            
    - **C**linical Data
        - What is clinical data?
            
            Not a discrete component of nutritional assessment
            
            Data obtained from clinical examination and evaluation of an individual's condition
            
            Physical examination (Anthropometric data)
            
            Laboratory test (Biochemical data)
            
            Observation by physician
            
            Medical History of patient
            
            Most important: Holistic analysis from a professional
            
        - What are the caveats of clinical data?
            
            Heavily dependent on professional, who can make error e.g Misdiagnosis
            
    - **D**ietary Data
        - What are the types of dietary data?
            - Dietary recall/nutritional interview
                
                Structured interview to capture information on food intake, portion size and food preparation of an individual
                
                - What are the caveats of dietary recall?
                    
                    Requires both a trained interviewer and a trained interviewee who can provide accurate and honest answers
                    
            - Food diary
            - Dietary questionaire/survey
                
                Example in HK
                
                ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                
                Alters policy making and education strategies to improve public health
