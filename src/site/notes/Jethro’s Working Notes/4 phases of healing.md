### 4 phases of healing

There are essentially 4 sequential (yet, to a certain degree, overlapping) phases of healing, which are Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodelling.

Hemostasis occurs within hours after an injury,

Inflammation ([[IAS72  Acute inflammation \|IAS72  Acute inflammation ]]) starts within hours, after hemostasis is achieved, and lasts a maximum of 3 days.

Proliferation follows, and lasts weeks.

Remodelling follows and last for months.
