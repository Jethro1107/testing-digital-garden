### Neoplasia of the esophagus

Benign neoplasia of the oesophagus - Esophageal papilloma, esopageal lipoma, esophageal leiomyoma.

- **Malignant neoplasia of the esophagus**
    
    Esophageal carcinoma - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, Esophageal adenocarcinoma
    
    Esophageal small cell carcinoma derived from neuroendocrine cells.
    

### Carcinoma of the esophagus

- **Risk factors of esophageal carcinoma**
    
    The most important risk factor for esophageal carcinoma is the diet:
    
    - Restricted diet of cornmeal and pickled vegetables
    - Nitrosamine
    - Fungal contaminants
    - Trace element deficiency
    
    Chronic alcoholism and tobacco smoking also predisposes to esophageal carcinoma.
    
    Esophageal disorders predispose to carcinoma esophagus:
    
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Barrett Esophagus\|Barrett Esophagus]] is associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Achalasia\|Achalasia]]
    
    There is also a genetic predisposition to esophageal carcinoma.
    
- **Gross pathology of esophageal carcinoma**
    
    Esophageal carcinoma may appear as:
    
    - Polypoid or fungating tumours
    - Ulcerative tumours
    - Sclerosing or constrictive tumours
    
    Often, polypoid or fungating tumours progress into ulcerative tumours. As the tumour outgrows its vascular supply, it becomes ischaemic and necrotic, resulting in an ulcerative tumour.

- **Histological subtypes of esophageal carcinomas**
    
    Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma can occur at any level of the oesophagus. Histologically, it is characterised by the presence of keratin pearls and intercellular bridges.

    Esophageal adenocarcinoma arises only in the lower oesophagus, due to its association with chronic [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Reflux esophagitis\|Reflux esophagitis]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Barrett Esophagus\|Barrett Esophagus]]. It is characterised by presence of glandular structures.
    
- **Symptoms of esophageal carcinoma**
    
    Other than its systemic effects, esophageal carcinoma gives rise to progressive dysphagia due to obstruction or constriction.
    
- **Spread of esophageal carcinoma**
    
    Direct spread by local invasion (common) - to the lungs and aorta
    
    Lymphatic spread (common) - to regional lymph nodes. There may be submucosal spread resulting in formation of tumour nodules.
    
    Haematogenous spread - to the liver, brain etc.
