- Minimal change disease
    - **What is minimal change disease?**
        
        A relatively benign disorder, that is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, and is characterised by glomeruli that have a normal appearance by light microscopy, but often caused by podocyte injury
        
    - **Epidimeology of minimal change disease**
        
        Most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children (90%)
        
        Accounts for 10 to 15% of nephrotic syndrome in adults
        
        Peak incidence between 2 to 6 years old
        
    - **Glomerular pathology of minimal change disease**
        
        Light microscopy - normal
        
        Immunofluorescence microscopy - normal
        
        Electron microscopy - effacement of podocytes with no immune complex deposits

    - **Treatment for minimal change disease**
        
        Steroids - most respond rapidly to treatment
        
        Some develop steroid dependence or steroid resistance
        
    - **Outcome for minimal change disease**
        
        Long term prognosis is excellent
