### Brachial artery

The brachial artery is the continuation of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axillary artery\|Axillary artery]] once it crosses the lower borders of the teres major.

- ********************In the arm********************
    
     It descends along the groove between the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biceps brachii\|Biceps brachii]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachialis\|Brachialis]], and somewhat superficial to the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Coracobrachialis\|Coracobrachialis]].
    
    The brachial artery supplies the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm.
    
    It also gives rise to an immediate branch, the deep (profundus) brachial artery, which accesses the posterior scapular region via the triangular interval and accompanies along the radial groove of the humerus to supply the posterior compartment of the arm.

- ****************************************In the cubital fossa****************************************
    
    The brachial artery descends all the way into the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cubital fossa\|Cubital fossa]], lies medially to the biceps tendon, and overlied by the bicipital aponeurosis.
