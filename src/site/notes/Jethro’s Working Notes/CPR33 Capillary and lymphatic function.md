### Microcirculation

- Structure of the microcirculation and capillary system
    - **Function of the microcirculation**
        
        Transport of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of metabolic excreta
        
    - **Key factor for controlling local blood flow to tissue**
        
        Radius of arterioles, determined by contractility of VSMC in arterioles determine the local blood, which is in response to the metabolic state of tissue
        
        Ref: [[Metabolic theory of controlling local blood flow\|Metabolic theory of controlling local blood flow]]
        
    - Structure of capillaries
        - **Diameter of capillary wall**
            
            4-9 micrometers, roughly larger than the diameter of a red blood cell
            
        - **Structure of capillary wall and capillary membrane for fluid exchange**
            
            Capillary wall is made of a single layer of endothelial cells surrounded by basement membrane
            
            Intercellular clefts are present between endothelial cells, with a width of 6-7 nanometers, slightly smaller than the diameter of an albumin molecule, allowing for water and small molecules to move in and out the cell in a paracellular manner
            
            Endothelial cells consist of caveolae, which enable the transport of macromolecules by trancytosis

        - **Capillary specialization in special organs and their permeability**
            
            Brain - continuous capillary (with continuous basement membrane and complete endothelial cells), but endothelial cells are held together by tight junctions, with the lost of intercellular cleft (blood brain barrier). Only very small molecules such as water, O2 and CO2 can pass through
            
            Liver - Sinusoidal capillary (discontinuous basement membrane and incomplete endothelial cells), with large intercellular cleft that allow passage of plasma proteins and blood cells
            
            Kidneys - Fenestrated capillary (continuous basement membrane and fenestrated endothelial cells), allowing passage of water and small molecules (but not plasma proteins) through the fenestrations on endothelial cells, without going through the intercellular cleft

- Exchange of water, nutrients and other substances between the blood and interstitial fluid
    - **How do lipid soluble substances diffuse across the capillary wall?**
        
        Lipid soluble substances (O2 and CO2) can diffuse directly through the cell memembrane of capillaries without the having to diffuse through the intercellular cleft
        
        Hence, they can diffuse through all surface of capillary wall, and their rate of diffusion is much faster than water-soluble substances like ions and glucose
        
    - **How do water and water-soluble substances diffuse across the capillary wall?**
        
        Water and water-soluble substances diffuse through the intercellular cleft (a relatively smaller area)
        
    - **Effects of molecular size on passage through intercellular clefts**
        
        Large molecules such as plasma proteins cannot pass through capillary pores as their diameter is greater than the width of intercellular cleft
        
        [[Gutyon and Hall Chapter 16  Effect of Molecular Size on Passage Through the Pores\|Gutyon and Hall Chapter 16  Effect of Molecular Size on Passage Through the Pores]] 
        
    - **Means of transferring substances between plasma and interstitial fluid and the driving force**
        
        By diffusion, driven by concentration gradient
        
        For O2, PO2 in plasma is greater than that of interstitial fluid, hence O2 diffuses from plasma to interstitial fluid
        
        For CO2, PCO2 in interstitial fluid is greater than that of plasma, hence O2 diffuses from interstitial fluid to plasma
        
- Interstitium and interstitial fluid
    - **What is the interstitium and its composition?**
        
        Interstitium is the space between cells in tissue, composed of collagen fiber and proteoglycan filaments in between
        
    - **What is interstitial fluid and its composition?**
        
        The gel-like fluid in the interstitum trapped in the space between proteoglycans
        
        Composition is similar to plasma, but with a very low concentration of plasma protein
        

### Fluid exchange in capillaries

- Capillary filtration, reabsorption and lymphatic system
    - **Definition of capillary filtration**
        
        Movement of fluid from capillaries into the interstitium
        
    - **Definition of capillary reabsorption**
        
        Movement of fluid from interstitium back to capillaries, often at venule-end of capillaries and post-capillary venules
        
    - **Relationship between capillary filtration, reabsorption and lymphatic absorption**
        
        Filtration = reabsorption + lymph flow

- Starling Forces
    - **4 Starling forces determining fuid exchange between capillaries and interstitial fluid**
        - Capillary hydrostatic pressure - Forces fluid out of capillaries into interstitial fluid
            - **Difference in capillary hydrostatic pressure in capillaries and values**
                
                Capillary hydrostatic pressure is highest at the arteriole end (around 35mmHg), and lowest at the venule end (around 15mmHg)
                
                This is because pressure drops owing to capillary resistance
                
            - **Factors determining mean capillary hydrostatic pressure**
                
                Mean capillary hydrostatic pressure is determined by arterial pressure, venous pressure, and ratio between postcapillary resistance and precapillary resistance:

                The arterial resistance is much greater than venous resistance, and the ratio is around 0.2

                Hence, venous pressure is a greater determinant of arterial pressure
                
        - Interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure - forces fluid out of interstitial fluid into capillaries (when positive)
            - **Value of interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure**
                
                Usually low, and even subatmospheric
                
            - **Effects of compression stockings on interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure**
                
                May increase the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure
                
        - Plasma Colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure - cause osmosis from interstitial fluid into capillaries
            - **What is oncotic pressure?**
                
                Oncotic pressure is the osmotic force exerted by plasma proteins, determined by the protein concentration in fluid compartment
                
            - **Normal value of plasma oncotic pressure and its origin**
                
                Plasma colloid osmotic pressure: 25-30mmHg
                
                Plasma is rich in plasma protein namely albumin (majority), globulin and fibrinogen, hence, it results in a high plasma oncotic pressure
                
        - Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure - cause osmosis from capillary into interstitial fluid
            - **Normal value of interstitial fluid oncotic pressure and reason for it**
                
                Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure: 5mmHg
                
                The capillary wall is much less permeable to protein, resulting in a low plasma protein concentration in interstitial fluid, hence it results in a low interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure
                
- Capillary exchange model (Starling’s hypothesis)
    - **Equation accounting for net transcapillary fluid movement (fluid flux)**

        When net fluid flux is positive, it indicates filtration
        
        When net fluid flux is negative, it indicates reabsortion
        
        Ref: [[Cardiovascular physiology concept  Physical mechanisms governing fluid exchange\|Cardiovascular physiology concept  Physical mechanisms governing fluid exchange]] 
        
    - **Major driving force for filtration and reabsorption in capillaries**
        
        Interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure and interstitial fluid osmotic pressure is very low, and thus insignificant driving forces
        
        Capillary hydrostatic pressure is the major driving force for filtration
        
        Plasma oncotic pressure is the major driving force for reabsorption
        
    - **Elaborate on Starling’s hypothesis of capillary exchange model**
        
        Starling assumes that interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, plasma oncotic pressure and interstitial fluid oncotic pressure is constant
        
        This is true for most capillaries as filtration fraction is less than 1% (except in kidneys), such that it does not produce any significant changes
        
        The only variable is capillary hydrostatic pressure, which is highest at arteriole end and lowest at venule end

        At arteriole end, the capillary hydrostatic pressure is greater than the plasma colloid osmotic pressure, resulting in positive net driving force and hence positive fluid flux
        
        At venule end, the capillary hydrostatic pressure is lower than plasma colloid pressure, resulting in negative net driving force and hence negative fluid flux
        
        Thus, capillary filtration occurs at arteriole end and capillary reabsorption occurs at venous end
        
        Ref: [[Cardiovascular physiology concept Chapter 8  Capillary exchange model\|Cardiovascular physiology concept Chapter 8  Capillary exchange model]] 
        

### Lymphatic system

- **Function of lymphatics**
    
    Not all of fluid filtered is reabsorbed by capillary, but must return to blood to prevent build up of excessive interstitial fluid to prevent tissue oedema
    
    The lymphatic system serves to drain excessive interstitial fluid and return it back to circulation
    
- **Function and structure of lymphatic capillaries**
    
    Lymphatic capillaries (initial lymphatics) are blind ended found near capillary beds to drain excessive interstitial fluid
    
    Lymphatic capillaries do not have a basal laminae
    
    Endothelial cells do not have tight junctions, such that interendothelial junctions behave like one way valves called primary lymph valves
    
    Anchoring filaments tether endothelial cells to surrounding connective tissue to maintain patency of cells
    
    Initial lymphatics converge to give collecting lymphatics
    
- **Function and structure of lymphatic vessels**
    
    Lymphatic vessels (collecting lymphatics) channel lymph towards subclaviain vein
    
    Endothelial cells are held together by tight junctions, such that they do not pocess primary lymph valves
    
    Lymphatic vessels consist of a continuous basal laminae, an endothelium, smooth muscles and secondary lymph valves
    
    Lymphangion is a functional unit of a lymphatic vessel lying between secondary lymph valves
    
- **Mechanism of flow in lymphatic capillaries**
    
    During expansion phase, the accumulation of interstitial fluid causes an increase in interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, which exceeds pressure of lymph, causing primary lymph valves to open, drawing interstitial fluid in
    
    During compression phase, compression of lymph capilllaries during respiration walking and peristalsis increases lymph pressure, causing primary lymph valve to close, and opening secondary lymph valve, allowing lymph to flow into lymphatic vessels

- **Mechanism of lymphatic pump in aiding flow in lymphatic vessels**
    
    When lymph enters a lymphangion, the pressure in lymphangion increases
    
    This induces contraction of smooth muscles by myogenic mechanism
    
    The previous secondary lymph valve close to prevent backflow of lymph, the next secondary lymph valve opens and lymph flows into the next lymphangion

- **External forces promoting lymphatic flow**
    
    Intermitant contraction from:
    
    Contraction of surrounding skeletal muscles
    
    Movement of the body
    
    Pulsation of arteries adjacent to the lymphatics
    
    Compression of tissue by objects outside the body (compression stocking)
