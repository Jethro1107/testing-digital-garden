### Classification of Microbes

- What is microbiology?
    
    Microbiology - The study of organisms which are usually small in size, and simple in structure
    
- How are microbes classified?
    
    Prions, Viruses, Bacteria, Fungi, Protozoa, Parasites
    
- What is clinical microbiology?
    
    Clinical microbiology refers to the subset of microbiology that concerns the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases
    

### Laboratory Diagnosis of Viral Infection

- Why is laboratory diagnosis required?
    
    Diagnosis based on clinical symptoms, and scans only allows a clinician to make a guess, laboratory diagnosis of infection serves as a definitive diagnosis
    
- How can laboratory diagnosis be classified?
    
    Diagnosis using microbial factors:
    
    Visualization - Gram stain, electron microscopy of viruses
    
    Culture of the microbe
    
    Detection of specific microbial components - Ag detection test, PCR
    
    Diagnosis using host factors:
    
    Antibody response of the host towards microbial components - Serology
    
- What are laboratory diagnosis methods based on visualization?
    
    Gram stain and visualization of bacteria under a light microscopy
    
    Electron microscopy of viruses
    
- When will Nucleic acid amplification be used to diagnose an infection?
    
    When microbe is not visible under microscopy, and that the microbe takes a very long time to culture to form a colony
    
    Nucleic acid amplification (PCR or RT-PCR) is used to amplify one short segment of the microbe genome, which would produce a visible band of defined size on gel electrophoresis
    
- How is nucleic acid amplification used to diagnose an infection?
    
    Nucleic acid amplification (PCR or RT-PCR) is used to amplify one short segment of the microbe genome, which would produce a visible band of defined size on gel electrophoresis
    
    Fluorescent Probe hybridization can be used to detect viral/microbial load during PCR
    
- Describe the process of antibody detection in a lab by ELISA.
    
    Produce specific microbial antigen by genetic engineering (Recombinant DNA technology)
    
    When the recombinant antigen is produced, add patient serum onto it
    
    If antibody is present, it would bind to the antigen
    
    Then, add anti-immunoglobin enzyme and substrate
    
    A colour change should be observable if antibody is present in the serum
    
- Describe the process of antigen capture and detection in a lab.
    
    Produce antibody against the microbe (e.g. by animal vaccination and extraction)
    
    Add specimen containing the antigen to the antibody
    
    Then add second layer of antibody
    
    Add anti-immunoglobin enzyme and substrate
    
    A colour change should be present if antigen is present in the specimen
    

### Pathogenesis of Virus

- Describe the 3 ways virus produces host damage.
    
    Direct cytolysis - By intracellular replication in host cells or by secretion of toxins/enzymes
    
    Immunopathological damage - Inappropriate innate immune activation or molecular mimicry (Similarity between foreign antigen to self antigen activate autoreactive lymphocytes)
    
    Oncogenesis - Integration of viral genome into host chromosome, causing chronic inflammation
    

### Classification of Bacteria

- How are bacteria classified?
    
    By gram stain appearance - Gram positive (purple), gram negative (red)
    
    By appearance - Cocci in clusters, cocci in chains, Bacilli (rods), Curved bacilli, Spirochaetes
    

### Features of Bacteria

- What is the difference between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria?
    
    Gram-positive bacteria has a thicker peptidoglycan cell wall than gram-negative bacteria
    
    Gram-negative bacteria has an outer membrane while gram-positive bacteria does not
    
- What is conjugation?
    
    Formation of sex pili to exchange plasmid DNA
    
    Since plasmid DNA contain antibiotic resistance genes, this enables rapid spread of antibiotic resistance
    
- What is the function of flagella?
    
    To provide motility of bacteria
    
- What is the function of capsule?
    
    To provide anti-phagocytic properties to bacteria
