### Pancreatitis

- **What is pancreatitis?**
    
    *Pancreatitis is the inflammation of the pancreas that is caused by the autodigestion of the pancreas by its own enzymes. It can be classified into acute and chronic pancreatitis.*
    
    Normally, autodigestion of the pancreas by its own enzymes is rare as [[Several mechanisms prevent autodigestion of the pancreas\|Several mechanisms prevent autodigestion of the pancreas]], namely the enzymes being produced as inactive zymogens, and the secretion of trypsin inhibitors.
    
    Autodigestion of pancreas by its own enzymes underlies the pathogenesis of both *acute* and *chronic* pancreatitis.
    

### Acute pancreatitis

- **Pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis**
    
    Acute pancreatitis is caused by reversible parenchymal injury that results in the inappropriate release and activation of pancreatic enzymes, resulting in autodigestion of pancreas, which elicit an acute inflammatory response.
    
    There are 3 proposed mechanisms that results in the inappropriate release and activation of pancreatic enzymes:
    
    1. *Pancreatic duct obstruction/ Biliary tract disease.* The obstruction can be caused by [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gallstones\|Gallstones]], parasitic infections (liver flukes - Clonorchis sinesis), periampullary neoplasms.
        - The obstruction results in the increase in intraluminal pressure of the pancreatic duct, resulting in the accumulation of enzyme rich fluid in the interstitium. Pancreatic lipase is released by acinar cells in its active form (see [[Pancreatic acinar cells release a list of digestive enzymes upon stimulation\|Pancreatic acinar cells release a list of digestive enzymes upon stimulation]], [[Pancreatic lipase mediates physiologically significant fat digestion in the small intestine\|Pancreatic lipase mediates physiologically significant fat digestion in the small intestine]] ), which digest the fats in adipocytes, resulting in necrosis of adipocytes.
        - Death of adipocytes results in the release of proinflammatory mediators by pancreatic stellate cells and leukocytes, which results in interstitial oedema, which compresses on the vasculature, resulting in ischemic pancreatic acinar injury.
    2. *Primary pancreatic acinar injury.* Primary pancreatic acinar injury is usually precipitated by alcohol, drugs or even blunt trauma.
        - Primary pancreatic acinar injury eventually results in the inappropriate release of lysozymes and zymogens, resulting in pancreatic enzyme activation.
    3. *Defective intracellular transport of zymogens within acinar cells.*
        - Inappropriate transport of zymogens lysozome compartments results in intracellular activation of zymogens by hydrolases. This results in acinar cell injry.

- **Etiology of acute pancreatitis**
    
    The main etiologies of acute pancreatitis are **alcoholism** and **biliary tract disease** (e.g. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gallstones\|Gallstones]]).
    
    Other causes of acute pancreatitis include:
    
    - Obstruction of the pancreatic duct
    - Drugs
    - Viruses - Mumps, Coxackievirus
    - Trauma
    - Dyslipidemia
    - idiopathic
- **Histopathology of acute pancreatitis**
    
    Histopathology of acute pancreatitis depends on its clinical course (from a self limiting disease to a severe medical emergency). Hence, histopathology can vary from limited inflammation to extensive necrosis and haemorrhage.
    
    The histological hallmarks of acute pancreatitis include:
    
    - Interstitial oedema and inflammation
    - Fat necrosis
    - Destruction of pancreatic parenchyma, resulting in its necrosis
    - Destruction of vascular wall (due to activated elastase activity) and haemorrhage

- **Clinical features of acute pancreatitis**
    
    The cardinal sign of acute pancreatitis is **acute abdominal pain**. **Vomiting** after a meal (1-2 hours) is also common.
    
    Leakage of enzymes, and inflammatory mediators have several implications:
    
    - **Elevated serum amylase or serum lipase levels** can support diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
    - Release of inflammatory mediators trigger a systemic inflammatory response, this could result in **shock**, **acute renal failure** (as a result of acute tubular necrosis) and **adult respiratory distress syndrome**.
- **Complications of acute pancreatitis**
    
    Acute pancreatitis - systemic organ failure due to shock
    
    Chemical peritonitis
    
    Retroperitoneal hemorrhage - Erosion into superior mesenteric artery and veins in acute hepatitis can cause retroperitoneal bleed. (The superior mesenteric artery and veins descend posterior to the neck of the pancreas)
    
    Local abscess
    
    Pseudocyst formations
    

### Chronic pancreatitis

- **What is chronic pancreatitis?**
    
    Chronic pancreatitis is the irreversible injury of the pancreas, characterised by fibrosis, loss of pancreatic parenchyma resulting in insufficiency in both of its exocrine and endocrine functions, and pseudocyst development.
    
- **Gross pathology of chronic pancreatitis**
    
    Fibrotic panrenchyma with focal cystic change due to ductal dilitation.
    
    Stones may also be observed in the pancreatic duct.
    
- **Histopathology of chronic pancreatitis**
    
    Irregular acinar atrophy (decrease in cell size).
    
    Periductal fibrosis, where some ducts show ectasia and cystic changes.
    
    Chronic inflammatory infiltrates around the lobules and ducts.

- **Complications of chronic pancreatitis**
    
    Complications of chronic pancreatitis mainly includes pseudocyst formation ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pancreatic cysts\|Pancreatic cysts]]) and the effects of pancreatic insufficiency.
    
    Pancreatic insufficiency can be due to a reduction of exocrine functions or a reduction of endocrine functions:
    
    - Reduction of exocrine functions - Malabsorption, weight loss, Hypoalbuminemia, duct obstruction, steatorrhea
    - Reduction of endocrine functions - Secondary [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]]
