### Sarcomere is the basic unit of a myofibril (Structure of a sarcomere)

The sarcomere is the basic unit of a myofibril, defined by the 2 Z discs, and an M line in the middle. 

- **The sarcomere is made of thick and thin filaments and associated giant accessory proteins**
    
    Thin filaments - 2 F-actin, nebulin, tropomyosin and troponin
    
    Thick filament - Myosin
    
    - Each thick filament consist of 300 myosin molecules, each with 2 intertwining subunits. Each myosin consist of a myosin head that forms cross-bridges with actin-binding site, and a hinge that is involved in myosin head pivot during the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Contractile cycle\|Contractile cycle]].
    
    2 giant accessory proteins are present:
    
    - Nebulin, in the thin filament attached to the Z disc but does not extend to the M line.
        
        It holds the two F-actin together.
        
    - Tintin, extends from the Z disc to the M line.
        
        It is the largest protein in the body, which serves 2 functions:
        
        1. It provides elasticity, which enables recoil of the sarcomere back to its resting length during relaxation.
        2. It stabilizes myosin.

- ************************************************************************************************************Due to the arrangement of thick and thin filaments, there are different bands in a sarcomere************************************************************************************************************
    
    I band - consist of thin filament only
    
    A band - Defined by the length of the thick filament
    
    - The A band consist of the zone of overlap and the H band.
    
    During contraction, A band remains constant in length, while I band shortens.
    
    The zone of overlap increases in length and the H band decreases in length.

The sarcomere is the smallest unit of a muscle fibre, as [[Sliding filament theory describes how muscle tension is produced at a Sarcomere level\|Sliding filament theory describes how muscle tension is produced at a Sarcomere level]].
