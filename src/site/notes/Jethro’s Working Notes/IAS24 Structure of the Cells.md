### Cell Membrane

- **What is unit membrane?**
    
    Unit membrane - The same membrane structure is present uniformly in the cell membrane and membranous organelles in all cells
    
- **What is the cell membrane comprised of according to the fluid mosaic model?**
    
    The phospholipid bilayer and membrane proteins
    
    - **What are the properties of the phospholipid bilayer?**
        
        Semipermeable - inpermeable to ions, variable permeability to water, O2 and other small non-polar molecules
        
        Highly Fluidic - Since phospholipid molecules are freely associated to each other, membrane proteins can diffuse laterally across the bilayer
        
    - **What are the 2 types of membrane proteins?**
        
        Integral protein - transverse the entire bilayer
        
        Peripheral protein - reside on either side of the bilayer
        
- **How is the membrane used for cell compartmentalization?**
    
    Organelles such as mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus can be formed
    
    - Mitochondria
        - **What is the structure of the mitochondria?**
            
            Cylindrical organelle bounded by a double membrane
            
            Outer membrane is permeable to most substances, while inner membrane is permeable to a narrow range of substance
            
            Inner membrane is folded into cristae to increase surface area for embedding enzymes involved in the ETC
            
        - **Elaborate on Mitochondrial DNA.**
            
            Mitochondrial DjNA (37 genes) replicate independently to nuclear RNA
            
            Some Mitochondrial proteins are encoded from mitochondrial DNA, but most are encoded from nuclear DNA
            
        - **What is the function of the mitochondria?**
            
            Involved in aerobic respiration (TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation)
            
    - Nucleus
        - **What is the structure of the nucleus?**
            
            Spherical structure bounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envolope
            
            Pores present to allow entry and exit of substances, e.g mRNA and ribosomal proteins
            
    - Rough ER
        - **What is the structure of the rough ER?**
            
            Interconnected, membrane bounded organelles with ribosomes attached
            
        - **What is the function of the rough ER?**
            
            Protein synthesis - Protein synthesised in ribosomes retained in ER and released in vesicles to Golgi for modification
            
    - Smooth ER
        - **What is the structure of the smooth ER?**
            
            Interconnected, membrane bounded organelles free of ribosomes
            
        - **What is the function of the smooth ER?**
            
            Lipid synthesis and detoxification (hepatocytes)
            
            Steroid synthesis (Leydig cells in testes)
            
            Ca storage (as SR)
            
    - Golgi Apparatus
        - **What is the structure of the Golgi Apparatus?**
            
            Stacks of flattened sheets that are not interconnected
            
        - **What is the function of the Golgi Apparatus?**
            
            Formation of lysosome
            
            Modification of proteins
            
            Proteins transported from rough ER to Golgi in transport vesicles, which enter at cis face
            
            Protein is passed along different layers and is modified
            
            Modified proteins exit at trans face as secretory vesicles, which is transported via cytoskeleton to cell membrane and is released by exocytosis
            

### Nuclear structure, nucleolus and protein synthesis

- **What is the nucleus?**
    
    Spherical organelle bounded by a double membrane, a gene transcription centre
    
- **Why is the nucleoplasm heterogenously-stained?**
    
    The darker regions, being dense-staining contains heterochromatin, densely packed chromatin which is inactive in gene transcription
    
    The lighter regions, being light-staining contains euchromatin, loosely packed chromatin which is active in gene transcription
    
- **What is the nucleolus?**
    
    Site of synthesis of ribosomal RNA
    
    Genes encoding for ribosomal RNA is present on 5 pairs of chromosomes
    
    Ribosomal RNA transcribed combines with ribosomal proteins that enter via the nuclear pores to give ribosomal subunits
    
    Ribosomal subunits leave the nucleus and are assembled into functional ribosomes
    
- **What are the steps to protein synthesis in the intracellular membrane system?**
    
    mRNA transcribed leave the nucleus via nuclear pores and associate with ribosomes for translation/protein synthesis
    
    Proteins synthesized are retained in ER and are transported in transport vesicles to Golgi
    Proteins are modified in the Golgi, and is either secreted as lysosome or secretory vesicles
    

### Cytoskeletons

- **What are the three types of cytoskeletons?**
    - Microfilament/Actin
        - **What is the diameter of actin?**
            
            7nm
            
        - **Please elaborate on the actin dynamics**
            
            Actin exists in 2 forms : G (globular) actin and F (filamentous) actin
            
            Actin constantly undergoes polymerization and depolymerization between the two forms, this is known as actin dynamics
            
        - **What are the functions of actin?**
            
            It is involved in actin-myosin interactions:
            
            in muscle cells, it is to allow for muscle contraction
            
            in non-muscle cells, it is to change cell shape, or to achieve cell movement either by formation of cell protrusions or by cell crawling
            
            It is also involved in cytokinesis:
            
            The actin ring contracts to divide the cell into two daughter cells
            
            It also gives shapes to microvillis:
            
            Each microvillus is made of an actin core, anchored to the actin web
            
            Actin web can control movement of microvilli via actin-myosin interactions
            
    - Intermediate filaments
        - **What is the diameter of intermediate filaments?**
            
            10nm
            
        - **Different intermediate filaments are present in different cell types. List a few of them and their functions.**
            
            Epithelial cells - Keratin (resist stretching force on epithelium to prevent cells from rupturing)
            
            Smooth muscle cells - Desmin (involved in actin-myosin interactions)
            
            Glial cells - Glial filaments (provides support to glial cells)
            
            Neurons - Neurofilaments (gives cell shape and allows axon transport)
            
            Fibroblast - Vimentin (maintains cell integrity)
            
            Nucleus - Nuclear lamin (maintains nucleus shape)
            
    - Microtubules
        - **What is the diameter of microtubules?**
            
            20-25nm
            
        - **What is the centrosome, and what is its function?**
            
            It acts as the microtubule organization centre (MTOC) which involves the dynamic organization of the microtubule network
            
            It consists of 2 centrioles, each is a ring of 9 microtubule triplets formed from gamma-tubulin
            
        - **What are microtubules made of?**
            
            alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin
            
        - **Is the microtubule network static?**
            
            Microtubule network is not static, but dynamic in nature
            
            It shortens and lengthens constantly by polymerization at the +ve end and depolymerization at the -ve end respectively
            
            This is known as microtubule instability
            
        - **What are the functions of microtubules?**
            - Involved in the transport of organelles and material in the cytosol
                
                Microtubules acts as tracks, while motor proteins acts as the cargos for transporting organelles, vesicles and proteins
                
                Kinesin moves towards the +ve end while Dynein moves towards the negative end
                
            
            Involved in forming mitotic spindles
            
            - Involved in ciliary and flagella movements
                
                In cilia and flagellum, microtubules are arranged into axoneme, which consists of a ring of 9 douplets of microtubules, and 2 single microtubules in the center
