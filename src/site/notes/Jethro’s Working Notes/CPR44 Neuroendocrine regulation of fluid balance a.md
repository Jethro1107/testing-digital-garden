### Overview of neuroendocrine mechanism of regulating fluid balance and blood pressure

- **Effects of changes in extracellular fluid volume and osmolality**
    
    Changes in ECF volume will result in a change in blood pressure
    
    Changes in ECF osmolality will result in fluid movement between ICF and ECF, resulting in shrinkage or swelling of cells (e.g swelling of neurons in brain increases intracranial pressure which leads to neurological symptoms)
    
- **2 determinants of extracellular fluid volume and osmolality**
    
    It is determined by fluid (water and Na+) intake and fluid excretion
    
    Fluid intake - increases volume and decreases osmolality, but is dictated by personal habits/social factors rather than physiological mechanism
    
    Fluid excretion (urine production) - regulated physiologically by kidneys, where excretion of Na+ and water is to match the fluid intake
    
    Excretion = Glomerular filtration - tubular reabsorption
    
    - **Which component, glomerular filtration or tubular reabsorption, is regulated to alter fluid excretion/urine output? Why?**
        
        Altered tubular reabsorption is the main drive to altering urine output
        
        Glomerular filtration rate is relatively constant (does not vary by more than 10%) due to autoregulation (myogenic regulation and tubuloglomerular feedback)
        
        Ref: [[Tubuloglomerular feedback in autoregulation of GFR\|Tubuloglomerular feedback in autoregulation of GFR]], [[Guyton and Hall  Tubuloglomerular Feedback and Autoregulation of Glomerular Filtration Rate\|Guyton and Hall  Tubuloglomerular Feedback and Autoregulation of Glomerular Filtration Rate]] 
        
- **Neural and hormonal mechanisms in regulation of fluid balance**
    
    Neural control - Renal sympathatic activity, modulated by baroreceptor and low pressure volume receptor reflex
    
    Hormonal control - Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Vasopressin, Atrial natriuretic hormones
    
- **Receptors involved in detection of volume/pressure of body fluid**
    
    Baroreceptors (high pressure) - in aortic arch, carotid sinus 
    
    Volume receptors (low pressure baroreceptors) - in atrium of heart and pulmonary vessels
    
- **Receptors involved in detection of osmolality of body fluid**
    
    Osmoreceptors found in hypothalamic PVN and SON responsible for production of sensation of thirst and release of vasopressin
    
    Macula densa cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus detects for NaCl concentration of filtrate, responsible for controlling RAAS
    

### Neural control of fluid balance

- **Effects of renal sympathetic stimulation on renal excretion**
    
    Stimulation of alpha-1 receptors:
    
    Constriction of afferent and efferent arterioles (effect on afferent > efferent), resulting in reduced glomerular blood flow and decreased GFR in strong renal sympathetic stimulation (due to autoregulation of GFR)
    
    Promote tubular reabsorption of Na+, and hence water (mainly in proximal tubules)
    
    Stimulation of beta-1 receptors:
    
    Increase renin secretion by JG cells, resulting in increased angiotensin II and aldosterone, resulting in increasing tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water
    
    Net effect:
    
    Promotes tubular reabsorption of water and Na+, resulting in decreased diuresis and natriuresis (decreased urine output) and increased ECF volume
    
    Ref: [[Guyton and Hall  Sympathetic Nervous System Control of Renal Excretion  Arterial Baroreceptor And Low-Pressure Stretch Receptor Reflexes\|Guyton and Hall  Sympathetic Nervous System Control of Renal Excretion  Arterial Baroreceptor And Low-Pressure Stretch Receptor Reflexes]]

- Neural component of pressure diuresis and pressure natriuresis
    - **Neural response to increase blood pressure/volume and effects on urine output**
        
        Increased blood volume and blood pressure stimulates baroreceptors
        
        Baroreceptors signal Nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) via glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve
        
        NTS stimulates caudal ventral lateral medulla, which inhibits rostral ventral lateral medulla, thus inhibiting renal sympathetic activity
        
        Decreased sympathetic activity will result in decreased tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water via decreased alpha-1 adrenergic stimulation and inactivated RAAS system due to decreased renin release from sympathetic stimulation
        
        This results in increased diuresis and natriuresis, i.e. increased urine output and decreased ECF volume (blood volume)
        
        As Guyton would say, increased pressure results in increased urine output
        
    - **Neural response in response to decrease blood pressure/volume and effects on urine output**
        
        Decreased blood volume and blood pressure decreases baroreceptor activity
        
        This results in decreased stimulation of NTS, removing inhibition on RVLM, resulting in increased stimulation of renal sympathetic nerves
        
        Increased sympathetic activity will result in increased tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water via alpha-1 adrenergic stimulation and activated RAAS system due to increased renin release from sympathetic stimulation
        
        This results in decreased diuresis and natriuresis, i.e. decreased urine output and increased ECF volume (blood volume)
        
        As Guyton would say, decreased pressure results in decreased urine output
        

### Hormonal mechanisms in regulation of body fluid balance

- Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
    - Renin
        - **Site of renin synthesis**
            
            Renin is synthesized, stored and released by juxtaglomerular cells (modified smooth muscle cells of afferent arterioles) of the juxtaglomerular apparatus
            
        - **3 mechanism of renin release**
            
            Baroreceptor reflex (JG cells act as baroreceptors, not the actual action of baroreceptors) - Increased pressure in afferent arteriole inhibits renin release will decreased pressure promotes renin release
            
            Sympathetic nerve mechanism - Sympathetic stimulation results in increased renin release via action of beta-1 adrenergic receptors
            
            Macula densa cells - Increased NaCl concentration in distal tubules decreases renin release, while decreased concentration stimulates renin release

            Angiotensinogen is readily produced by the liver and released into systemic circulation
            
            Upon release of renin by JG cells, angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin I, which is physiologically inactive
            
            Angiotensin I is converted into angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which is the most abundant in the lungs
            
        - **Receptor mediate effects of angiotensin II**
            
            Angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1R), expressed on various tissue
            
        - **Physiological function of angiotensin II**
            - Vasoactive agent
                - **Short term and long term action of Angiotensin II**
                    
                    Angiotensin II binds to VSMC AT1R to trigger a myriad of signalling cascade
                    
                    Short term effect:
                    
                    Contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in vasoconstriction, increased peripheral resistance and increased mean arteriole pressure
                    
                    Long term effects:
                    
                    Increase endothelin-1 production (vasoconstrictor)
                    
                    Increase proliferation and decrease apoptosis of VSMC
                    
                    Deposition of extracellular matrix resulting in fibrosis
                    
                    These all results in vascular remodelling, causing decreased vascular compliance and elasticity

            - Stimulates tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water
                - **How does angiotensin II stimulate tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water?**
                    1. Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion, which in turn increases tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water
                    2. Angiotensin II directly stimulates reabsorption of Na+ in nephrons

                        Angiotensin II binds to AT1R on basolateral membrane to stimulate action of Na+/K+ ATPase and Na+/HCO3- co-transporter, promoting reabsorption of Na+ and hence reabsorption of water
                        
                        Angiotensin II in tubular filtrate binds to AT1R on apical membrane to stimulate action of Na+/H+ exchanger, promoting reabsorption of Na+ and hence reabsorption of water
                        
                    3. Angiotensin II constricts efferent arterioles
                        
                        Constriction of efferent arterioles decreases hydrostatic pressure of peritubular capillaries, promoting reabsorption of Na+ and water
                        
                        Constriction of efferent arteriole also decreases blood flow via vasa recta, such that it maintains high osmolality with medullary interstitium, thus promoting rate of water reabsorption
                        
                    
                    Ref: [[Guyton and Hall  Angiotensin II Increases Sodium and Water Reabsorption\|Guyton and Hall  Angiotensin II Increases Sodium and Water Reabsorption]] 
                    
            - Acts on the brain to stimulate thirst and salt appetite, promote vasopressin secretion → All to raise blood pressure
            - Acts on adrenal cortex to promote aldosterone secretion (promote reabsorption of Na+ and water in distal tubules)
            - Inhibits release of renin by JG cells (negative feedback)
        - **Degradation of angiotensin II**
            
            Ang II can be degraded by agiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), into angiotensin-(1-7), which can bind to Mas receptor

    - Aldosterone
        - Synthesis and secretion of aldosterone
            - **Site of synthesis of aldosterone and hormones required**
                
                Aldosterone is mineralocorticoid hormone synthesized in zona glomerulosa cells of adrenal cortex
                
                Hypothalamus secrets corticotropin-releasing hormone, which stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone by anterior pituitary 
                
                Adenocorticotropic hormone is necessary for synthesis of aldosterone

        - **Physiological function of aldosterone**
            
            Aldosterone (hydrophobic) diffuses into tubular cells and binds to mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
            
            Aldosterone-MR complex acts as transcription factor for a number of genes encoding:
            
            Na+/K+ ATPase inserted on basolateral membrane
            
            Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) inserted on apical membrane
            
            Renal outer medullary K+ channels (ROMK) inserted on apical membrane
            
            This results in increased Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion

    - **Factors affecting vasopressin release by pituitary gland**
        - Osmolality of body fluids
            - **Receptors involved in sensing osmolality of body fluids and their mechanism of function**
                
                Osmoreceptors, a specialized mechanosensitive receptor, known as Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid (TRPV) that converts changes in osmolality into electrical signals, as it has a pore loop segment (between 5th and 6th transmembrane segment) that acts as a cation channel
                
                ![[40F77076-AD53-4A17-9966-2C56B104A7CB.jpeg\|40F77076-AD53-4A17-9966-2C56B104A7CB.jpeg]]
                
                Response to hyperosmolality:
                
                Plasma hyperosmolality induces cell shrinkage, which results in a confirmation change in the osmoreceptor. leading to opening of the pore loop, and increased cation conductance.
                
                Membrane becomes depolarized, resulting in firing of action potential
                
                Response to hypoosmolality:
                
                Plasma hypoosmolality induces water entry by osmosis, resulting in stretching of cell membrane, supressing osmoreceptor, reducing cation conductance
                
                Membrane becomes hyperpolarized, inhibiting firing of action potential

            - **Location of osmoreceptor in the brain**
                
                Organum Vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), Subfornical Organ (SFO) - Circumventricular organs that lack blood-brain barrier, thus detecting plasma osmolality

            - Summary of regulation of osmolality of body fluids
                
                Dehydration/hyperosmolality:
                
                Hyperosmolality results in cell shrinkage, resulting in conformational change in osmoreceptor, increasing cation conductance and depolarization of magnocellular neurons in paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus in hypothalamus, causing them to fire action potential
                
                Action potential arives at axonal terminal at posterior pituitary gland, resulting in the release of vasopressin into circulation
                
                Vassopressin binds to V2R on basolateral membrane of principal cells, allowing the insertion of AQP-2 into apical membrane
                
                The collecting duct is permeable to water, causing water reabsorption into circulation, restoring osmolality

                They increase firing in response to stretch of blood vessels
                
            - **Baroreceptor reflex pathway in controlling vasopressin release**
                
                Baroreceptor signals ascend via glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve to the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) of the medulla
                
                NTS neurons send excitatory pathway to the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM)
                
                CVLM neurons send inhibitory pathway to rostral ventrolatereal medulla (RVLM)
                
                RVLM has excitatory neurons that project to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON)

            - **Response of baroreceptor reflex controlling vasopressin release in normal conditions/hypertension**
                
                Tonic activity of baroreceptors at normal blood pressure and increased baroreceptor signals in hypertension inhibits the exitatory pathway from RVLM to hypothalamic PVN and SON, such that no vasopressin is released from the posterior pituitary

            - **Response of baroreceptor reflex controlling vasopressin release in hypotension**
                
                Decreased activity of baroreceptor in hypotension decreases stimulation of NTS, and hence decreases stimulation on CVLM
                
                This removes inhibitory effect of CVLM on RVLM, thus causing a tonic excitatory imput into PVN and SON, resulting in VP secretion

                Vp binds to V2R on basolateral membrane, which has 2 effects:
                
                1. Phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine residue at 256 position, resulting in trafficking of AQP-2 bearing vesicles to the apical membrane
                2. Depolymerization of apical actin web, facilating AQP insertion onto apical membrane
                
                Net effect - Insertion of aquaporin-2 onto the apical membrane increases the permeability of water, allowing for water reabsorption, producing an anti-diuretic effect

                Chronic increases in Vp levels also stimulate transcription of AQP2 gene, increasing AQP2 production
                
        - Induces arteriolar vasoconstriction, including vasa recta
            - **How does vasopressin induce vasoconstriction and its effect on mean arterial pressure?**
                
                Vasopressin binds to V1a receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells, which stimulate phospholipase C, resulting in IP3 production, triggering Ca2+ release 
                
                The intracellular signalling cascade stimulates VSMC contraction and vasoconstriction
                
                Systematic arteriolar vasoconstriction results in increased vascular resistance and increased arterial pressure
                
            - **Effects of vasopressin induced vasoconstriction on water reabsorption**
                
                Decreased blood flow to renal medulla, increasing osmolality of medullary interstitium, thus promoting water reabsorption
                
        
        The combined effect is increased water reabsorption from kidneys
        
- Atrial natriuretic peptide
    - **Synthesis and secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide**
        
        ANP is synthesized and released by atrial muscle fibres upon stretching of the atria
        
    - **Physiological function of ANP**
        
        ANP is vasoactive:
        
        It binds to its receptor on VSMC and leads to vasodilation, decreased peripheral resistance and blood pressure
        
        It causes vasodilation of afferent arteriole, and vasoconstriction of efferent arterioles, causing an increase in glomerular filtration rate
        
        ANP drives natriuresis:
        
        It inhibits Na+ reabsorption by peritubular capillaries at proximal tubules
        
        It inhibits the Na+ channels of the luminal membrane of collecting duct principal cells
        
        It inhibits renin release by JG cells, thus inhibiting Ang II formation and aldosterone secretion
        
        It inhibits aldosterone secretion by adrenal cortex directly
        
        ANP drives diuresis:
        
        It inhiits secretion of vasopressin by posterior pituitary, thus preventing insertion of AQP-2 in principal cells
        

### Integrated response in regulation of fluid balance and blood pressure

- **Integrated response to increased sodium intake and effects on urine output and blood pressure**
    
    Initially, increased sodium intake results in hyperosmolality of body fluids, stimulating osmoreceptors, resulting in vasopressin release by the posterior pituitary
    
    This results in the sense of thirst results in increased fluid intake, restoring ECF osmolality to normal and increasing ECF volume
    
    Increased vasopressin also results in increased water reabsorption in collecting duct, restoring ECF osmolality and increasing ECF volume
    
    Increase in ECF volume results in increased blood pressure, stimulating the baroreceptor reflex, causing decreased renal sympathetic stimulation, decreased renin release
    
    Atrial stretching also results in ANP release
    
    Thus, there is decreased Na+ reabsorption and water reabsorption, resulting in increased diuresis and natriuresis, causing a decrease in ECF volume and hence decreased blood pressure
    
- **Integrated response to haemorrphage effects on urine output and blood pressure**
    
    Haemorrhage results in decreased blood pressure, this results in decreased baroreceptor reflex, thus increased renal sympathetic activity and increased renin release. Angiotensin II formation also stimulates vasopressin release.
    
    Increased sympathetic outflow:
    
    It causes vasoconstriction, causing an increased total peripheral resistance
    
    It also cause venous vasoconstriction, increasing venous return and hence increasing preload to increase cardiac output
    
    It also directly results in increased heart rate and contractility, increasing cardiac output
    
    Increased renin release results in increased Ang II formation and aldosterone secretion
    
    Ang II promotes arteriolar vasoconstriction, increasing total peripheral resistance
    
    Ang II and aldosterone promotes tubular reabsorption of Na+ and water, thus restoring blood volume and blood pressure
    
    Increased vasopressin release also promotes reabsorption of water in collecting duct, thus restoring blood volume and blood pressure
