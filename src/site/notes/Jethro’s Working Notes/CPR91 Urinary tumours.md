### Benign kidney tumours

- Papillary adenoma
    - **What is papillary adenoma?**
        - Benign renal neoplasm that forms small, discrete tumours

            - **How is low grade and high grade urothelial carcinoma classified?**
                - High grade urothelial carcinoma differs from low grade urothelial carcinoma by:
                    - Increased cellularity and nuclear crowding (Increase in N:C ratio)
                    - Disturbed cellular polarity
                    - Absence of differentiation from basal to apical layers

            - **Difference between invasive and non-invasive urothelial carcinoma**
                - Non-invasive urothelial carcinoma:
                    - No invasion through basement membrane, thus unable to metastasize through haematogenous and lymphatic spread
                    - Associated with better prognosis, i.e. Non-invasive low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma has a 10-year survival rate of 95%
                - Invasive urothelial carcinoma:
                    - Invasion through basement membrane, thus able to metastasize through haematogenous and lymphatic spread
                    - Associated with poorer prognosis
            - **T staging of urothelial carcinoma**
                - Invasion into lamina propria (T1)

                - High grade cytological atypia
                - 80% of high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma are invasive
        - **Mode of spread of non-invasive urothelial carcinoma**
            - Spread within the urinary system by implantation
