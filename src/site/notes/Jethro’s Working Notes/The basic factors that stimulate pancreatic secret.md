### The basic factors that stimulate pancreatic secretions are acetylcholine, secretin and cholecystokinin

Acetylcholine and cholecystokinin stimulate acinar cells more than ductal cells, resulting in secretion of large amounts of enzymes and small amounts of fluids.

Secretin stimulates the secretion of large quantities of isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution by ductal cells, but have little effects on enzyme secretion by acinar cells.

Acetylcholine is released by posganglionic neurons of vagal nerve and cholinergic nerves of the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]]. *Acetylcholine mainly stimulates enzyme secretion by acinar cells.*

Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released by I cells in the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa. *[[Cholecystokinin controls enzyme secretion by pancreatic acinar cells in the intestinal phase\|Cholecystokinin controls enzyme secretion by pancreatic acinar cells in the intestinal phase]].*

Secretin is released by S cells of the proximal part of small intestine. *[[Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase\|Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase]].*
