### Digestion and absorption of carbohydrates

Dietary carbohydrates mainly include Starch, disaccharides (sucrose, lactose and trehalose). It must be digested into absorbable molecules before it can be absorbed into circulation.

[[Salivary alpha-amylase and pancreatic alpha-amylase are involved in the digestion of starch\|Salivary alpha-amylase and pancreatic alpha-amylase are involved in the digestion of starch]]. This results in the formation of certain digestive products of starch (maltose, isomaltose, maltotriose). *Note that dietary disaccharides are not digested by salivary and pancreatic digestive amylase*. [[Intestinal brush border enzymes (small intestinal disaccharides) are involved in the digestion of disaccharides into monosaccharides\|Intestinal brush border enzymes (small intestinal disaccharides) are involved in the digestion of disaccharides into monosaccharides]]. 

After being processed by the intestinal brush border enzymes, three end products of carbohydrate digestion is formed: glucose, galactose and fructose. These monosaccharides are readily absorbed by enterocytes into circulation. [[Absorption of carbohydrates is mediated by by Na+ dependent transport and facilitated diffusion\|Absorption of carbohydrates is mediated by by Na+ dependent transport and facilitated diffusion]].

### Digestion and absorption of proteins

Dietary proteins constitute the exogenous supply of amino acids. They are the only source of essential amino acids. Digestion of proteins occur first in the stomach ([[Pepsinogen is an inactive zymogen released by chief cells\|Pepsinogen is an inactive zymogen released by chief cells]]). This results into the breakdown of 15% proteins into smaller peptides (this is physiologically not necessary).

Upon release into the duodenum, [[The pancreas release a list of zymogens for protein digestion\|The pancreas release a list of zymogens for protein digestion]]. Together, pancreatic protease break down 70% of luminal peptides into oligopeptides (dipeptides and tripeptides) and 30% into amino acid. 

[[Absorption of luminal oligopeptides and amino acids into enterocytes occur via different mechanisms\|Absorption of luminal oligopeptides and amino acids into enterocytes occur via different mechanisms]]. Eventually, within the enterocyte, oligopeptides are broken down into amino acids by di- and tri-peptidase. Amino acid leaves the enterocytes into circulation via basolateral facilitated diffusion transporters. 

### Digestion and absorption of fats

Dietary fats mainly include triglycerides, free choleserol, cholesteryl ester and phospholipids. [[Emulsification of lipids into lipid droplets is a key preliminary step to fat digestion\|Emulsification of lipids into lipid droplets is a key preliminary step to fat digestion]] . [[Pancreatic lipase mediates physiologically significant fat digestion in the small intestine\|Pancreatic lipase mediates physiologically significant fat digestion in the small intestine]]. However, pancreatic lipase may be displaced by bile salts at the lipid-water interface of the lipid droplet. This problem is solved by colipase [[Colipase serves as a co-factor of pancreatic lipase\|Colipase serves as a co-factor of pancreatic lipase]] .

### Digestion and absorption of nucleic acid

Nucleic acid is taken in large amounts as they are present in all cells.
