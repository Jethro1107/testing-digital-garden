### Diuretics

- Loop diuretics
    - **Examples of loop diuretics**
        
        Furosemide, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide
        
    - **Function of thick ascending limb of loop of henle**
        
        NKCC co-transporters mediates reabsorption of NaCl from tubular fluid into medullary interstitium
        
        This results in dilution of tubular fluid and hypertonicity of medullary interstitium
        
        This establishes a osmotic gradient between collecting duct and medullary interstitium to drive reabsorption of water

        Ref: [[Function of loop of henle\|Function of loop of henle]], [[Countercurrent multiplier system in creating hyperosmotic medullary interstitium\|Countercurrent multiplier system in creating hyperosmotic medullary interstitium]], [[Guyton and Hall  Countercurrent multiplier system in producing hyperosmotic renal medullary interstitium\|Guyton and Hall  Countercurrent multiplier system in producing hyperosmotic renal medullary interstitium]] 
        
    - **MOA of loop diuretics**
        
        Inhibits NKCC channels, inhibiting NaCl reabsorption
        
        This increases diuresis and natriuresis
        
        This results in increased secretion of K+ and H+ in collecting duct:
        
        Increase of Na+ concentration in collecting duct results in increased activity of Na+/K+-ATPase on basolateral membrane of principal cells, which drives increased sodium reabsorption, creating a negative luminal potential promoting K+ secretion
        
        Increase in Cl- concentration in collecting duct facilitates diffusion of Cl- via paracellular transport into interstitium. This increases the Cl- concentration in interstitium, promoting reabsorption of HCO3- via anion-exchanger 1 on basolateral membrane of IC-A cells. Thus, CO2 and H2O combines under action of CA-IV into H2CO3 and dissociates to give H+ and HCO3-, and H+ is secreted into the lumen by primary active transport
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        This also inhibits reabsorption of Ca2+ and Mg2+:
        
        Inhibition of diffusion of K+ into lumen via apical membrane K+ channels abolishes electrochemical gradient, which inhibits reabsorption of Ca2+ and Mg2+
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Clinical use of loop diuretics**
        - Treatment of oedema
            - **MOA of loop diuretics in treating oedema**
                
                By increasing Na+ excretion:
                
                Inhibits NKCC channels on loop of Henle, reducing reabsorption of NaCl, promoting diuresis and natriuresis
                
                Useful in treating oedematous states due to retention of salt (i.e. heart failure, kidney disease)
                
                By increasing systemic venous capacitance (vascular effect of loop diuretics):
                
                Thus reducing left ventricular filling pressure (preload)
                
                This decreases venous pressure, and hence capillary pressure, thus used for treating oedema (in venous and pulmonary congestion)
                
        - Treatment of hypertension
            - **MOA of loop diuretics in treating hypertension**
                
                Inhibition of NKCC channels in loop of Henle reduces reabsorption of Na+, thus promoting diuresis and natriuresis
                
                This results in a decrease in blood volume and decrease in venous pressure
                
                Thus, this reduces preload, reducing stroke volume and cardiac output, and thus reducing mean arterial pressure
                
            - **Limitation of loop diuretics in treating hypertension and clinical use**
                
                Short half-life:
                
                The decrease in blood volume stimulates post-diuretic Na+ reabsorption, thus counteract the antihypertensive action
                
                Thus, it is only used in patients with mild renal insufficiency (30-40ml/min GFR) or in resistant hypertension
                
    - **Adverse effects of loop diuretics**
        1. Hyponatremia
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        2. Hypokalemia
            
            Exacerbate arrhythmias
            
            Reversed by reduced Na+ intake and K+ replacement
            
        3. Metabolic alkalosis
            
            Reversed by K+ replacement
            
        4. Hypomagnesia
            
            Exacerbate arrhythmias
            
        5. Hypocalcemia
            
            Rare as Ca2+ homeostasis achieved by various mechanisms
            
        6. Hyperurecemia
            
            Hypovolemia promotes uric acid reabsorption in proximal tubules
            
            Precipitate gout attack
            
        7. Hyperglycemia, Hyperlipidemia
            
            Due to increased sympathetic activity
            
        8. Ototoxicity (hearing problem) - mostly due to ethancrynic acid
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        9. Sulfonamide-related hypersensitivity reaction
            
            Least likely with ethacrynic acid
            
    - **Cause of resistance to loop diuretics**
        
        Reduced renal blood flow:
        
        Reduced delivery of diuretics to loop of Henle
        
        Reduced renal blood flow results in accumulation of endogenous organic acids, competes with loop diuretics for organic acid transport system in proximal tubules, thus reducing active secretion of diuretics in proximal tubules
        
        Drug interaction:
        
        NSAID inhibits prostaglandin production, where PDE2 is responsible for maintaining renal blood flow in reduced renal perfusion
        
        Drugs (e.g propenacid) competes for organic acid transport system in proximal tubules, thus decreasing active secretion of diuretics in proximal tubules
        
        Increased Na+ reabsorption in proximal tubules:
        
        In hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome and heart failure, proximal Na+ reabsorption is increased, thus decreasing delivering of Na+ to loop of Henle
        
- Thiazide-like diuretics
    - **Examples of thiazide-like diuretics**
        
        Hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, indapamide
        
    - **Function of distal tubules in terms of salt reabsorption**
        
        Na+/Cl- cotransporter in apical membrane of tubular cells in distal convoluted tubule drives reabsorption of NaCl, thus diluting tubular fluid
        
        Note: Most Na is reabsorbed at upstream sites before reaching the distal tubule
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **MOA of thiazide-like diuretics**
        
        Inhibits Na+/Cl- co-transporter, thus inhibiting NaCl reabsorption, promoting diuresis and natriuresis
        
        It also promotes reabsorption of Ca2+:
        
        Na+/K+ pump causes a decrease in concentration of Na+ in tubular cells
        
        As Na+/Cl- symport is inhibited, Na+ can only enter cells via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
        
        Ca2+ is pumped out of tubular cells in the interstitium, causing a decrease in Ca2+ concentration in tubular cells, allowing Ca2+ to diffuse down electrochemical gradient from lumen into tubular cells via Ca2+ channels
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Clinical use of thiazide-like diuretics**
        - Treatment of oedema
            - **MOA of thiazide-like diuretics in treating oedema**
                
                Inhibits Na+/Cl- co-transporter, thus inhibiting NaCl reabsorption, promoting diuresis and natriuresis
                
            - **Limitations of thiazide-like diuretics in treating oedema**
                
                Less effective than loop diuretics because most Na+ is reabsorbed in loop of henle
                
                Ineffective in patients with GFR< 30-40 mL/min (renal failure)
                
        - Treatment of hypertension
            - **MOA of thazide-like diuretics in treating hypertension**
                
                Inhibits Na+/Cl- co-transporter, thus inhibiting NaCl reabsorption, promoting diuresis and natriuresis
                
            - **Why is thiazide-like diuretics advantagous for treating hypertension?**
                
                Inexpensive
                
                Efficacious for mild hypertension (results in drop of 10-15mmHg)
                
                Longer acting with safer profile (less fluctuation in drug plasma level, thus less flunctuations in blood pressure):
                
                - Once daily dosage
                - Well tolerated for chronic use
                
                Few contraindications
                
            - **Anti-hypertensive effects of acute, subaccute, and chronic thiazide administrations**
                
                Acute (1-2 weeks): Promotion of natriuresis and diuresis, thus causing decreased in blood volume and decrease in blood pressure
                
                Subacute (2-8 weeks): Renin release and increased sympathetic activity due to decrease in blood volume causes an increase in blood pressure
                
                Chronic (>8 weeks): Thiazide has direct vasodilator effect, causing decreased TPR and thus decreased blood pressure
                
            - Some genetic differences may contribute to resistance to thiazide
    - **Adverse effects of thiazide-like diuretics**
        1. Hyponatremia
        2. Hypokalemia
        3. Metabolic alkalosis
        4. Hypomagnesia
        5. Hypercalcemia
            
            Rare, but can be unmasked due to other causes, e.g. hyperparathyroidism
            
        6. Hyperglycemia
            
            Reduced insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, as thiazide diuretics activates ATP-sensitive K+ channels, causing hyerpolarization
            
            Also due to reduced tissue utilization of glucose
            
            Reversed with correction of hypokalemia
            
        7. Hyperlipidemia
        8. Sulfonamide-related allergic reactions
        
        GLUC: Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperurecemia, hypercalcemia
        
- Potassium-sparing diuretics
    - Amiloride
        - **MOA of amiloride**
            
            Amiloride inhibits renal epithelial Na+ channel on apical membrane of tubular cells in collecting duct, thus inhibiting Na+ reabsorption
            
            Blockade of ENaC in collecting duct causes hyperpolarization of membrane, inhibiting secretion of cations like K+ and H+

    - Aldosterone antagonists
        - **Examples of aldosterone antagonist**
            
            Spironolactone, eplerenone
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        
        - **Physiological function of aldosterone**
            
            Aldosterone (hydrophobic) diffuses into tubular cells and binds to mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
            
            Aldosterone-MR complex acts as transcription factor for a number of genes encoding:
            
            Na+/K+ ATPase inserted on basolateral membrane
            
            Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) inserted on apical membrane
            
            Renal outer medullary K+ channels (ROMK) inserted on apical membrane
            
            This results in increased Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
            Ref: [[Guyton and Hall  Aldosterone Stimulates Renal Sodium Reabsorption and Potassium Secretion\|Guyton and Hall  Aldosterone Stimulates Renal Sodium Reabsorption and Potassium Secretion]] 
            
        - **MOA of aldosterone antagonist**
            
            Aldosterone antagonist binds competitively to minerocorticoid receptors
            
            This inhibits the formation of aldosterone-MR complex, inhibiting the synthesis of aldosterone-induced products (AIP)
            
            This inhibits reabsorption of Na+ and secretion of K+
            
            This results in mild diuretic and natriuretic response, while reducing K+ secretion
            
    - **Clinical use of potassium-sparing diuretics**
        - Combined therapy with other diuretics
            
            To increase the diuretic response to other diuretics (for treatment of oedema/hypertension)
            
            To reduce K+ secretion by other diuretics
            
        - Treatment for aldosteronism (mainly for aldosterone antagonists)
            
            Reduce refractory oedema associated with primary hyperaldosteronism and secondary aldosteronism (evoked by heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic cirrhosis)
            
    - **Adverse effects of potassium-sparing diuretics**
        1. Hyperkalemia
            
            Exacerbate cardiac arrhythmia
            
            Enhanced with renal diseases or drugs which inhibit renin and angiotensin II
            
            Reversed by thiazide diuretics
            
        2. Metabolic acidosis
            
            Due to inhibition of the excretion of H+
            
        3. Gynecomastia, impotence, menstrual irregularities
            
            Selective to spironolactone (antagonist for androgen and progesterone receptors)
            
            Not with eplerenone
            
- **Compare diuretic efficiency between loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics and pottasium-sparing diuretics**
    
    Loop > thiazide > K+-sparing
    
- Combination therapy

### Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor

- ACE inhibitors / Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
    - **Examples of ACE inhibitors**
        
        Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, quinapirl
        
    - **MOA of ACE inhibitors**
        
        Decreased formation of angiotensin II and subsequent release of aldosterone
        
        Treatment for oedema:
        
        This results in decreased Na+ reabsorption, thus decreasing fluid retention
        
        Treatment for hypertension:
        
        Decreased vasoconstriction, resulting in decreased TPR
        
        Decreased TPR causes a decrease in blood pressure, reducing ventricular remodelling, thus improving survival
        
        Note that ACE is used for breakdown of bradykinin, thus ACE inhibitor results in increased bradykinin
        
    - **Examples of ARBs**
        
        Losartan, valsartan
        
    - **MOA of ARBs**
        
        Block Angiotensin type 1 receptors, reducing effect of angiotensin II
        
        Decreased action of angiotensin II and subsequent release of aldosterone
        
        Treatment for oedema:
        
        This results in decreased Na+ reabsorption, thus decreasing fluid retention
        
        Treatment for hypertension:
        
        Decreased vasoconstriction, resulting in decreased TPR
        
        Decreased TPR causes a decrease in blood pressure, reducing ventricular remodelling, thus improving survival
        
    - **Clinical use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs**
        
        Treatment of oedema (not as effective as loop diuretics)
        
        Treatment of heart failure
        
        Treatment of hypertension
        
    - **Adverse effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs**
        
        Hypotension
        
        Acute renal failure
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Hyperkalemia - due to inhibition of K+ secretion, cautious with K+ - sparing diuretics
        
        Risk of fetal hypotension, renal failure or malformation - contraindicated in pregnancy
        
    - **Specific adverse effect of ACE inhibitors**
        
        Decreased breakdown of bradykinin, causing increased levels of bradykinin (vasodilation)
        
        Dry cough (bradykinin irritates airways)
        
        Angioedema
        
    - **Advantage of ARBs**
        
        More complete blockade of RAAS:
        
        as angiotensin II can be formed through ACE-independent pathways
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Do not affect angiotensin type II receptors:
        
        Stimulate vasodilation and bradykinin release
        
    - **Insufficiency of ACE inhibitors and ARBs**
        
        Increased renin release due to inhibition of negative feedback action of angiotensin II
        
- Direct Renin inhibitors
    - **Examples of direct renin inhibitors**
        
        Aliskiren
        
    - **MOA of direct renin inhibitors**
        
        Decrease activity of renin, causing decreased formation of angiotensin and aldosterone release
        
        Decreased formation of angiotensin II and subsequent release of aldosterone
        
        Treatment for oedema:
        
        This results in decreased Na+ reabsorption, thus decreasing fluid retention
        
        Treatment for hypertension:
        
        Decreased vasoconstriction, resulting in decreased TPR
        
        Decreased TPR causes a decrease in blood pressure, reducing ventricular remodelling, thus improving survival
        
    - **Adverse effects of direct renin inhibitors**
        
        Acute renal failure
        
        Hyperkalemia - due to inhibition of K+ release, cautious with K+-sparing diuretics
        
        Risk of fetal hypotension, renal failure or malformation - contraindicated during pregnancy
