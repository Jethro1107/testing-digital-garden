### Enteric nervous system

Along the GI tract, there are two layers of plexuses that comprise the enteric nervous system, the **submucosal (Meissner) plexus** and the **myenteric (Auerbach) plexus**. 

The submucosal plexus (located in the submucosal layer of the GI tract), has *secretomotor function*, involved in regulating secretion by mucousal glands and the motility of muscularis mucosae.

The myenteric plexus (located between the inner circular muscle and the outer circular muscle of the muscularis propria/ externa) mainly has *motor functions*, involved in coordinating the contraction of the muscularis propria (i.e. peristalsis) to push food down the GI tract.

While the enteric nervous system can function independently, *the enteric nervous system is under the influence of the autonomic nervous system*, which can greatly enhance or inhibit gastrointestinal functions*.*
