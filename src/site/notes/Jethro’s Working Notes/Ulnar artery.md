### Ulnar artery

The ulnar artery is a branch of the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Brachial artery\|Brachial artery]], and usually crosses between the two layers of the pronator teres muscle, as it emerges deep to the flexor digitorum superficialis.

- ****************************In the forearm****************************
    
    The ulnar artery gives off a common interosseous branch, which immediately branches into the anterior interosseous artery and posterior interroseous artery, located anterior and posterior to the interosseous membrane between the ulna and radius.
    
    The ulnar artery courses medially, lateral to the ulnar nerve.
    
- **In the wrist**
    
    It gives off a deep palmar branch of the ulnar artery, that anastamose with the [[deep palmar arch formed by the radial artery\|deep palmar arch formed by the radial artery]].
    
    It continues on the palmar surface, and continues with as the superficial palmar arch.
