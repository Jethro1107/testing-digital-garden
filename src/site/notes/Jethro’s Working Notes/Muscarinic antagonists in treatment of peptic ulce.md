### Muscarinic antagonists in treatment of peptic ulcers

- **Examples of Muscarinic antagonists in treatment of peptic ulcers**
    
    Pirenzepine, Dicyclopine
    
- **MOA of muscarinic antagonists in treatment of peptic ulcers**
    
    Muscarinic antagonists binds to and inhibits M3 receptors in parietal cells. This results in reduced intracellular Ca2+ levels, and prevents the activation fo H+/K+ ATPase.
    
    This reduces gastric acid secretion.
    
    However, muscarinic antagonists are not as effective as [[Jethro’s Working Notes/H2 antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcers\|H2 antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcers]], and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Proton pump inhibitors\|Proton pump inhibitors]], only reducing gastric acid secretion by 20-30%, and thus are *rarely used now*.
    
- **Adverse effects of muscarinic antagonists**
    
    As muscarinic antagonists are present on many organs, they result in many side effects:
    
    - Dry mouth
    - Blurred vision
    - Cardiac arrhythmias
    - Urinary retention
