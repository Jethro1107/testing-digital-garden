### The 3 phases of gastric secretions

There are 3 phases of gastric secretions: 1) Cephalic phase, 2) Gastric phase and 3) Intestinal phase. They represent the time before food enters the stomach, the time when food enters the stomach, and the time when food leaves the stomach.

- Cephalic phase - It occurs before food enters the stomach. Gastric secretions in this phase originates from the sight, smell, thought and taste of food.
- Gastric phase - It occurs when food enters the stomach and last for 3-4 hours. Gastric secretions in this phase originates from the distension of the stomach.
- Intestinal phase - It occurs when food leaves the stomach, as the stomach empties acidic chyme into the duodenum.
- **Gastric acid secretion are stimulated by different mechanisms in different phases:**
    
    Cephalic phase (20-30% of gastric acid secretion):
    
    - Signals from gastric acid secretion originates from the cerebral cortex and the appetite centre (amygdala and the hypothalamus), which is transmitted to the Nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMX) in the medulla oblongata. The signal then travels via the vagus nerves to the stomach.
    - In the body of the stomach, postganglionic vagus muscarinic neurons release acetylcholine.
    - In the antrum of the stomach, postganglionic vagus peptidergic neurons release gastrin-releasing peptides (GPR), which stimulates the release of gastrin by G cells.

    Gastric phase (6-70% of gastric acid secretion):
    
    - Gastric acid secretion in the gastric phase is set in motion by the distension of the stomach, which is mediated by 3 mechanisms:
        1. Long vasovagal feedback
            
            Distension of stomach stimulates the afferent vagal pathway, which stimulates the NTS and DMX.
            
            The signal travels via the efferent vagal pathway to the stomach, resulting in the release of acetylcholine.
            
        2. Local enteric plexus
            
            Distension of stomach stimulates the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]], which results in the release of acetylcholine.
            
        3. Gastrin mechanism
            
            Partially digested proteins (digested by pepsin) stimulates the release of gastrin into circulation by G cells.
            
    - Gastric acid secretion is inhibited by somatostatin secretion by D cells in the pyloric glands in the antrum. This occurs when the contents of the stomach palls below pH 2.
    
    Intestinal phase (10% of gastric acid secretion):
    
    - In the intestinal phase, gastric acid secretion is first stimulated, then inhibited.
    - Initially, intestinal gastrin is released into circulation, which accounts for the stimulation of gastric acid secretion.
    - There are two inhibitory pathways that inhibit gastric secretion in the intestinal phase:
        1. Distension of the duodenum, presence of fatty, acidic and hypertonic chyme triggers the enterogastric reflex.
        2. Intestinal factors such as Secretin (released by S cells), gastric inhibitory peptide/ glucose dependent insulinotrophic peptide (released by K cells), and cholecystokin (secreted by I cells) inhibits gastric secretions.
