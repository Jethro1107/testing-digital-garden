### Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares

As [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Urate-lowering agents\|Urate-lowering agents]] cause a sudden decrease in plasma uric acid levels, they can facilitate the dissolution of urate crystals that has already precipitated in tissues into plasma.

Uric acid travels from plasma to other joints, essentially enabling the mobilization of uric acid from tissue deposits.

Uric acid deposits in other joints, resulting in acute gouty flares.

Due to this property of urate-lowering agents:

- Urate-lowering agents have no role in treatment of acute gouty arthritis.
- Initial urate-lowering therapy is used in conjunction with NSAIDS in long term management of gout, until there is a reduction in excess tissue stores of uric acid.
