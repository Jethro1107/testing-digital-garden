### Secretin stimulates copious release of bicarbonate secretions by ductal cells in the intestinal phase

Secretin is released by S cells on the duodenal and jejunal mucosa as its inactive form, prosecretin. It is activated into secretin when the acidic chyme is released into the duodenum, i.e. Secretin is released from acid in stomach.

Secretin is absorbed into the blood stream and reaches the pancreas, where it activates the cAMP intracellular signalling pathway in the ductal cells, resulting in the activation of CFTR ([[Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids\|Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids]]), enables the secretion of large volumes of isotonic HCO3- secretions in the intestinal phase.

This provides the driving force for pancreatic enzymes to reach the small intestine during the intestinal phase ([[Functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells\|Functions of bicarbonate secretion by pancreatic ductal cells]]).
