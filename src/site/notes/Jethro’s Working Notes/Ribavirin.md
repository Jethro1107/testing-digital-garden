### Ribavirin

Ribavirin is an anti-viral drug that is used for the pharmacological management of chronic hepatitis C.

- ********************************MOA of Ribavirin********************************
    
    Ribavirin is a guanosine nucleoside analogue, and has several mechanism of actions:
    
    - It stimulates Th1 host response for viral clearance
    - It inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPHD), resulting in the depletion of GTP, thus inhibiting RNA replication.
    - It serves as a RNA mutagen, increasing mutation rates of HCV.
