### Greater omentum

The greater omentum is a peritoneal fold that extends from the greater curvature of the stomach and the first part of the duodenum, and proceeds inferiorly to give a free edge that drapes the transverse colon, jejunum and ileum. 

Reflecting posteriorly, the peritoneum of the greater omentum ascends where it becomes adherent to the transverse colon.
