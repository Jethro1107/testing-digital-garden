### Anteroposterior patterning (patterning of digits) is regulated by sonic hedgehog signalling

Sonic hedgehog is a morphogen that is required for anteroposterior patterning, involved in the patterning of the digits on the anterior (1st digit, radial side)-posterior (5th digit, ulnar side).

Hedgehog sending cells are found in the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), releasing sonic hedgehog signal (SHH), a morphogen that functions as a gradient, where, at different concentrations (with preset values) gives rise to different cell fates.

- **************************************SHH, the morphogen, and Gli complex, the transducer**************************************
    
    Production of SHH:
    
    - Hedgehog sending cells express a SHH precursor, which conjugates with a cholesterol molecule
    - Once released, it is cleaved by autocatalytic activity, forming SHH, that diffuses across the antero-posterior axis, establishing a gradient
    
    Stimulation of Hedgehog receiving cells:
    
    - SHH binds to Patched (PTc), the receptor, which in the absence of SHH inhibits Smothened (Smo). Binding of SHH to PTc removes the inhibiton of Smo.
    - Smo once activated, via a signalling cascade prevents the breakdown of Gli complex, which serves as an activator of the SHH signalling cascade.

- ********************************Sonic hedgehog functions as a gradient********************************
    
    When hedgehog sending cells in the zone of polarizing activity produce SHH, SHH diffuses from posteriorly to anteriorly, establishing a gradient of SHH.
    
    Different concentrations, results in different cell fates, the ultimate result is anteroposterior patterning to give digits.
