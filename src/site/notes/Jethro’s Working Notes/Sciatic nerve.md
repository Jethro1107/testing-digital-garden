### Sciatic nerve

The sciatic nerve is a big nerve that arises from contributions of L4 to S3. The anterior divisions of L4 and S3 gives rise to the tibial part, while the posterior division of L4 to S3 gives rise to the common peroneal part. This is because when anterior divisions unite relatively medially, and the posterior divisions unite relatively laterally.

The sciatic nerve accesses the gluteal region via the greater sciatic foramen, inferior to the piriformis. [[Mapping the sciatic nerve is necessary for intramuscular injections in the buttocks.\|Mapping the sciatic nerve is necessary for intramuscular injections in the buttocks.]]

    In the thigh, the sciatic nerve lies on the adductor magnus muscle, and is crossed by the long head of the biceps femoris.
    
    The tibial part of the sciatic nerve provides motor innervation to all muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh, except the short head of the biceps femoris, which is supplied by the common peroneal part.
