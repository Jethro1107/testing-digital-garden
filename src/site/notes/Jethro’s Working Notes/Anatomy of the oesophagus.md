### Anatomy of the oesophagus

The oesophagus is a 20-25cm tube that conducts food from the pharynx to the stomach. It extends from the oesophageal inlet (at the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage) to the gastroesophageal junction (OGJ).

- **There are 3 segments of the oesophagus:**
    1. The cervical part of the oesophagus,
    2. The thoracic part of the oesophagus,
    3. The abdominal part of the oesophagus.
- **There are 3 constrictions of the oesophagus:**
    1. The cricoid cartilage compresses the oesophagus at the oesophageal inlet
    2. The aortic arch, where the aortic arch crosses the oesophagus
    3. The diaphragmatic crus
    
    These constrictions are clinically significant, as they represent the regions at which foreign objects usually lodge at.
    

At the gastroesophageal junction, there is the lower oesophageal sphincter. The lower oesophageal sphincter is a physiological sphincter, where diaphragmatic crus facilitates reflux prevention.
