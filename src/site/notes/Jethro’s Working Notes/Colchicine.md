### Colchicine

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the management of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]], particularly in treatment of acute gouty arthritis, and gout flare prophylaxis during the initiation of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Urate-lowering agents\|Urate-lowering agents]].

- ******************************************MOA of Colchicine******************************************
    
    Colchicine inhibits tubulin polmerization into microtubules, thus inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis.
    
    It also inhibits leukotriene B4 production, thus inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis.
    
    Colchicine is found to act specifically to reduce phagocytosis of urate, thus reduce the subsequent inflammatory response to urate phagocytosis [[(as urate phagocytosis is the initial factor that triggers inflammation, particularly via inflammosome pathway)\|(as urate phagocytosis is the initial factor that triggers inflammation, particularly via inflammosome pathway)]].
    
- ******************************************************************Adverse effects of Colchicine******************************************************************
    
    Colchicine has a relatively narrow therapeutic index:
    
    - Commonly cause gastrointestinal disturbance - nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain
        
        This is due to the inhibition of tubulin polymerization in GI epithelial cells.
        
    - It can cause severe adverse effects:
        - Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy
        - Hepatotoxicity and hepatic necrosis
        - Acute renal failure
        - Hair loss
        - Bone marrow depression
- **************************************************Precautions of Colchicine**************************************************
    
    Dose reduction is required for those with hepatic or renal disease.
