### Ulnar nerve

Ulnar nerve (C8-T1) is a branch of the medial cord of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial plexus\|Brachial plexus]].

- ********************In the arm********************
    
    It courses down the medial side of the brachial artery in the anterior component of the arm, then pierces through the medial intermuscular septum into the posterior compartment of the arm (note its posterior position relative to the medial epicondyle of the humerus).
    
- **In the forearm**
    
    It descends down the forearm deep to the flexor carpi ulnaris of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterior compartment of the forearm\|Anterior compartment of the forearm]]. It supplies one and a half muscle: the *****flexor carpi ulnaris***** and the medial 1/2 of the *****flexor digitorum profundus.*****

- ********************In the wrist and hand********************
    
    The ulnar nerve passes into the hand outside of the carpal tunnel, where it provides:
    
    - Sensory innervation to the medial side of the hand and medial 1 and a half muscles (both dorsal and palmar surfaces)
    - Motor innervation to most intrinsic muscles of the hand, except for the thenar muscles and the lateral 2 lumbricals.
