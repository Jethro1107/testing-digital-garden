### Mechanism of Breathing

- What is ventilation?
    
    **Ventilation** is defined as the exchange of air between the atmosphere and alveoli
    
    Air, very much like blood, moves by **bulk flow**, from a region of high pressure to one of low pressure
    
    [[(Vander’s Human Physiology 11th Ed., 2007 p.446)\|(Vander’s Human Physiology 11th Ed., 2007 p.446)]]
    
- What is elasticity?
    
    Elasticity is the property of matter that causes it to recoil to its original shape or size after being deformed by an external force. The more elastic the structure is, the more force is necessary to deform the structure and the greater the recoil pressure is.
    
    **The distending pressure is equal to the recoil pressure**
    
- Define alveolar pressure, intrapleural pressure, transpulmonary pressure and trans chest wall pressure.
    
    **Alveolar pressure** refers to the gas pressure in the alveolus relative to that of the atmosphere
    
    **Intrapleural pressure** refers to the pressure in the pleural cavity relative to the atmosphere
    
    **Transpulmonary pressure (Ttp)** is the transmural pressure across the lungs:
    
    Ptp = Palv - Pip
    i.e. The pressure difference holding lungs open, opposing inward recoil of the lung [[(Lung distending pressure)\|(Lung distending pressure)]]
    
    **Trans chest wall pressure (Tcw)** is the transmural pressure across the chest wall:
    
    Pcw = Pip - Patm
    
    i.e. The pressure difference holding chest wall in, opposing outward recoil of the chest wall
    
- How is the negative intrapleural pressure created? What is the importance of a negative intrapleural pressure?
    
    **At end expiration**, the lung has the tendancy to recoil inward and the chest wall has the tendancy to recoil outward
    
    This causes an increase in volume in pleural cavity and thus a **decrease in intrapleural pressure**
    
    The negative intrapleural pressure is **important to counter balance the recoil pressure of chest wall and lungs**
    
- Discuss the mechanisms of breathing.
    
    **During inspiration:**
    
    Diaphragm and external intercostal muscles **contract**, increasing the volume of the thoracic cage, pulling the parietal pleura away from the visceral pleura, causing intrapleural pressure to become more subatmospheric
    
    This **increases the transpulmonary pressure** (increasing the lung distending pressure), causing the lung to expand
    
    The **alveolar pressure thereby becomes subatmospheric**, driving air flow into the lungs
    
    **During expiration:**
    
    Diaphragm and external intercostal muscles **relax**, allowing the chest wall to return to pre-inspiratory position
    
    This **decreases the transpulmonary pressure (decrease the lung distending pressure) back to pre-inspiration value**, allowing the lung to recoil back to preinspiration size
    
    Air in alveoli becomes compressed, causing **alveolar pressure to increase**, driving air out of the lungs
    

### Mechanics of Breathing - Statics

- Discuss the volume recoil pressure relationship of the lungs.
    
    Lung assumes natural position (where there is no recoil pressure as lung is not distended) at collapse, i.e. at residual volume (RV)
    
    The larger the lung volume (in terms of %of vital capacity VC), the greater the lung recoil pressure
    
    At the level of total lung capacity, the lung recoil pressure is at maximal
    
    Note that it is a non-linear curve
    
- What is lung compliance?
    
    Compliance - The volume change per unit change in transmural pressure, or the slope of volume-pressure curve
    
    [[Jethro’s Working Notes/CPR05 Introduction to the mechanism of breathing a/Lung Compliance\|Lung compliance]] - The magnitude of the change in lung volume produced by a given change in transpulmonary pressure
    
    [[(Vander's Human Physiology 11th Ed.,2007 p.452)\|(Vander's Human Physiology 11th Ed.,2007 p.452)]]
    
- What is the origin of lung recoil pressure/determinants of lung compliance?
    
    There are two origins of lung recoil pressure:
    
    1. Tissue elasticity (elastance/elasticity) - Accounts for 1/3 of recoil pressure
        
        Lung connective tissue consist of collagen and elastic, which obey’s Hooke’s Law
        
    2. Surface tension - Accounts for 2/3 recoil pressure
        
        Due to the presence of air-liquid interface, which obey’s Laplace’s Law:
        
        P = 2T/r
        
        P is the required distending pressure (the recoiling pressure) varies directly with T, the surface tension, and inversely with r, the radius of alveolus
        
- What is pulmonary surfactant?
    
    Pulmonary surfactant - A protein-carbohydrate-phospholipid complex produced by type II pneumocyte and clara cells that decreases the surface tension
    
- What is alveolar instability?
    
    When a small and large alveoli share the same alveolar duct, given the same surface tension, the pressure of the smaller alveoli is greater than that of the larger alveoli due to the smaller radius
    
    As a result, the small alveoli would collapse and empty into the large alveoli
    
- Other than the ability to decrease surface tension, what is another important property of surfactant?
    
    Surfactant is also able to stabalize alveoli of different size by altering surface tension, which varies with surface area
    
    As an alveolus gets smaller and smaller (surface area decrease), the concentration of surfactant increase, causing a reduction in surface tension, and thus a decrease in pressure
    
    This helps maintain a pressure in smaller alveoli equal to that in larger ones, stabalizing alveoli of all size
    
    [[(Vander's Human Physiology 11th Ed.,2007 p.453)\|(Vander's Human Physiology 11th Ed.,2007 p.453)]]
    
- What is the effect of surfactant on fluid transudation into the lungs?
    
    It decreases fluid transudation from the capillaries into the alveoli as surfactant molecules are hydrophobic
    
- To conclude, what are the three physiological functions of pulmonary surfactant?
    1. Reduce surface tension, thus increasing lung compliance and lower the work of breathing
    2. Achieve alveoli stability
    3. Prevent fluid transudation from capillaries into alveolus
- Describe how the effects of Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome is caused by a lack of surfactant.
    
    A lack of surfactant would cause:
    
    1. Increased surface tension and low lung compliance, increasing the work of breathing
    2. Alveolar instability, causing area of collapse
    3. Excess transudate in alveoli
- Discuss the volume recoil pressure relationship of the chest wall.
    
    Chest wall assumes natural position at 60%VC
    
    At <60%VC, chest wall has an outward recoil pressure (negative recoil pressure)
    
    At >60% VC, chest wall has an inward recoil pressure (positive recoil pressure)
    
- What is the origin of chest wall chest wall recoil pressure/ determinant of chest wall compliance?
    
    Tissue elasticity brought by collagen and elastin
    
- Describe the volume-recoil relationship of the lung-chest system.
    
    Volume change in quiet breathing occurs between 35%VC (Functional residual capacity/FRC) and 60%VC
    
    At FRC (35%VC) or end-expiratory position (EEP), the inward recoil pressure of the lungs balance the outward recoil pressure of the chest wall, such that no energy is required to maintain this position (relaxed muscle of respiration)
    
    For inhaling beyond the EEP to 60%VC, energy is required to overcome the inward recoil pressure of the lungs, which is helped by the outward recoil pressure of the chest wall (energy for quiet inspiration minimized)
    
    For exhaling from 60%VC to FRC, it is facilitated by the inward recoil pressure of the lungs
    
    For inhaling beyond 60%VC to TLC, extra energy is required because of the inward recoil pressure of the chest wall
    
    For exhaling beyond FRC to RV, extra energy is required to overcome the outward recoil of the chest wall, but it is facilitated by the inward recoil of the lungs
    
- Give two examples of pathophysiological conditions that cause a change in end-expiratory position.
    
    Emphysema - Loss of lung tissue elasticity
    
    Loss of lung tissue elasticity causes an increase in lung compliance, resulting in a decreased lung inward recoil pressure, thereby balancing the lower outward chest-wall recoil pressure at a high volume
    
    As a result, the FRC and EEP increase
    
    Pulmonary fibrosis - Increase of lung tissue elasticity due to deposition of scar tissue
    
    Deposition of scar tissue causes a decrease in lung compliance, resulting in an increased lung inward recoil pressure, thereby balancing the higher outward chest wall recoil pressure at a lower volume
    
    As a result, the FRC and EEP decrease
    
- What are the factors affecting lung compliance?
    1. Lung volume
        
        Low compliance at very low and very high lung volumes
        
        High compliance at moderate lung volume
        
    2. Size of lung
        
        Compliance of smaller lungs is lower than that of larger lungs
        
    3. Posture
        
        Upright to supine position increases pulmonary blood volume and pushes diaphragm towards, causing lung volume to decrease, and lung compliance to decrease
        
    4. Pulmonary blood volume
        
        Increased pulmonary blood volume or pulmonary vascular congestion causes lung compliance to decrease
        
    5. Age
        
        Increase in age causes a loss of elasticity, causing an increase in lung compliance
        
    6. Pathological conditions
        
        Emphysema (loss of elasticity) ⇒ Compliance increase
        
        Pulmonary fibrosis (gain of elasticity) ⇒ Compliance decrease
        
        Edema ⇒ Compliance decrease
        
- What are the factors affecting chest wall compliance?
    1. Posture
        
        Supine to upright position displaces diaphragm and abdominal content, causing increased compliance of chest wall
        
    2. Skeletal muscle disease
        
        Spasticity or rigidity of skeletal muscles keep muscles contracted, causing a decrease in compliance of chest wall
        
    3. Deformation of chest wall
        
        Deformation of chest wall due to obesity, old age or kyphoscoliosis causes a decrease in compliance of chest wall
