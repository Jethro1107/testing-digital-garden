### Histology of the small intestine

The small intestine consist of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/The common histological layers of the GI tract\|The common histological layers of the GI tract]], namely the mucosa, the submucosa, the muscularis externa and the serosa and adventitia.

- **Features of the mucosa of the small intestine**
    
    The mucosa is lined with a simple columnar epithelium that protrudes into the lumen to form [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intestinal villi\|Intestinal villi]], and invaginates deeply to form [[Crypts of Lieburkuhn (intestinal [[glands)\|Crypts of Lieburkuhn (intestinal [[glands)]]]].

    The lamina propria may consist of lymphoid nodules (mostly in the ileum as [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peyer’s Patch\|Peyer’s Patch]] ).
    
    There is nothing distinct about the muscularis mucosae.
    
- **Features of the submucosa of the small intestine**
    
    The submucosa remains a dense irregular connective tissue with blood vessels and lymphatics.
    
    The submucosa protrudes towards the lumen to form [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pilcae circulares\|Pilcae circulares]] , circular folds of the small intestine in gross anatomy.

    Note that in the proximal portion of the small intestine, the duodenum, submucosal glands are present as [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brunner’s glands in the duodenum\|Brunner’s glands in the duodenum]] .
    
- **Features of the muscularis externa of the small intestine**
    
    The muscularis externa of the small intestine consist of 2 sublayers: the inner circular muscles and the outer longitudinal muscles.
    
    In between the two sublayers is the myenteric plexus.
    
- **Features of the serosa/adventita of the small intestine**
    
    The entire small intestine is lined with serosa, whereas retroperitoneal organs are lined with adventitia.

- Distinct features are present in different regions of the small intestine:
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brunner’s glands in the duodenum\|Brunner’s glands in the duodenum]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peyer’s Patch\|Peyer’s Patch]] in the ileum
    - The jejunum appears as a textbook section of the small intestine.
