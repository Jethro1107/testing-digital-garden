### Innervation inducts AChR clustering at junctional folds

To enable precise alignment of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic vesicles and the AChR at the postsynaptic terminal, motor neurons have the ability to induce AChR clustering at junctional folds.

This is carried out by the Agrin-Lrp4-MuSK signalling pathway.

1. Motor neurons release extracellular matrix, including Agrin, into the synaptic cleft.
2. Agrin activates Lrp4 binding protein, which activates muscle specific kinase at the junctional folds within minutes.
3. Over a few hours, MuSK phosphorylates AChR, causing them to cluster at junctional folds.

It should be noted that the Agrin-Lrp4-MuSK signalling pathway does not require activation of the AChR.
