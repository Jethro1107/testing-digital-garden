### Obturator nerve

The obturator nerve is formed by the anterior divisions of the anterior rami of L2-L4. It lies deep to the psoas major, between the psoas major and the pelvic brim, and leaves the pelvic cavity via the obturator canal ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Gateways to the lower limb\|Gateways to the lower limb]]).

- ************************In the thigh************************
    
    Once the obturator nerve emerges from the obturator canal, superior to the obturator externus, it gives off 2 branches:
    
    - The anterior branch, which passes between the adductor brevis and adductor longus, provides:
        - Motor innervation to the medial compartment of the thigh, except the adductor portion of the adductor magnus: **************Pectineus (in 20% of population), Adductor longus, Adductor brevis and Gracilis.**************
        - Sensory innervation to the medial side of the thigh.

    - The posterior branch penetrates and provides motor innervation to the *obturator externus*, and descends to supply the *adductor portion of the adductor magnus*.

Related pathologies: Obturator nerve injury

Obturator nerve is rarely injured due to its deep position.

It will cause leg to swing out when walking due to paralysis of adductors/medial compartment of the thigh.
