### 5 types of bones by shape

Bones form the bulk of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Skeletal system\|Skeletal system]]. There are different types of bones classified by their shape:

1. Long bones - The length is relatively longer than the width.
2. Short bones - The length is similar with the width.
3. Flat bones - Flat bones tend to have a flat surface. They generally have prominent marrow cavity that holds bone marrows, for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Haematopoiesis\|Haematopoiesis]].
4. Irregular bones - Irregular bones have irregular surfaces, with foramens and grooves for conveying different structures. The many surfaces of irregular bones enables muscle attachment.
5. Sessamoid bones - Sessamoid bones are enclosed within the tendons.
