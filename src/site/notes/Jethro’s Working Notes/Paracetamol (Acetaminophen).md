Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is an *********analgesic*********, but lacks anti-inflammatory effects.
Paracetamol is useful for management of mild to moderate pain.
- #### Adverse effects of Paracetamol
	Paracetamol is generally well-tolerated at *therapeutic dose*.  
	Possible adverse effects include:
	    1. Hypersensitivity reactions, resulting in a mild rash
	    2. *Overdose of Acetominophen* results in **Acetominophen-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity**
	        By understanding the biochemical mechanisms of [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Acetominophen-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity\|Acetominophen-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity]], 2 factors are associated with increased risk of accumulation of NAPQI, and hence hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity:
		        1. Cytochrome P450 enzyme induction (e.g. Excessive alcohol consumption)
		        2. GSH deletion (e.g. Starving and malnutrition)
	        In general, acetominophen-induced hepatotoxicity is reversible with N-acetylcysteine, which serves the scavenging role of Glutathione.
