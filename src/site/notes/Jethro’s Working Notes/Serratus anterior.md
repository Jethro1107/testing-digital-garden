### Serratus anterior

Serratus anterior forms the medial wall of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axilla\|Axilla]], along with the lateral thoracic cage (ribs). It is a teeth-like muscle that originates from the lateral surfaces of ribs 1-9 and extends posteriorly and inserts onto the anterior (costal) surface of the medial border of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Scapulae\|Scapulae]]. Most muscle fibres of the serratus anterior **********************************************converge at the inferior angle of the scapula.**********************************************

******************************An important function of the serratus anterior is to hold the scapulae close to the thoracic cage or body.****************************** Paralysis of the serratus anterior muscles (due to long thoracic nerve injury) can cause winging of scapulae. This is the phenomenon when the scapula protrudes out, particularly the medial border (as it serves as the insertion for serratus anterior), when pressing against a wall.

    Serratus anterior muscles protracts the scapulae. This opposes the action of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Rhomboid major and minor\|Rhomboid major and minor]], and middle fibre of [[The middle fibres retract and adduct the scapulae.\|The middle fibres retract and adduct the scapulae.]].

    *************************Coordinated contraction of the upper fibres of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Trapezius\|Trapezius]] and the serratus anterior enables upward rotation of the scapulae.* The upper fibres of the trapezius elevate the acromion, while the serratus anterior pulls the inferior angle of the scapulae laterally, enabling the upward rotation of the scapulae. This action requires the arm to be held above the head, as [[full abduction involves both the movement at the shoulder joint and the rotation of the [[scapulae\|full abduction involves both the movement at the shoulder joint and the rotation of the [[scapulae]]]].
