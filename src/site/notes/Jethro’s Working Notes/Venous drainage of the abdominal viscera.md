### Venous drainage of the abdominal viscera

In general, venous drainage of the abdominal viscera follows the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera\|Arterial supply of the abdominal viscera]]. 

The inferior mesenteric vein drains into the the splenic vein. The splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein both drain into the common hepatic portal vein. The hepatic portal vein eventually drains into the hepatic vein via [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatic sinusoids\|Hepatic sinusoids]], which then drain into the inferior vena cava.

- **Porto-systemic anastamosis enables venous drainage of abdominal viscera to bypass the portal system.**
    
    Parts of gastric veins drains into the oesophagus.
    
    They may also drain from paraumbilical veins into periumbilical veins.
    
    They may also drain from into middle/ inferior rectal veins.
    
    They may also drain from colic veins into ascending lumbar veins.
    
    Hence, hepatic pathologies that result in portal hypertension may result in:
    
    1) Esophageal varices, 2) Haemorrhoids and 3) Caput medusae.
