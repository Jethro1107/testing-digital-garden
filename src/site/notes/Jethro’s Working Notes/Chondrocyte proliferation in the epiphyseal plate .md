### Chondrocyte proliferation in the epiphyseal plate is regulated by FGF signalling, particularly FGF-FGFR3 signalling

FGF signalling is mediated by FGF (18 types), the ligand, and FGFR (4 types), the receptor.

FGF signalling, in most cells results in a mitogenic outcome, *but FGF-FGFR3 signalling inhibits chondrocyte proliferation, and is thus a negative regulator of chondrocyte proliferation* (in contrast to the normal biological function of FGF signalling, which is mitogenic).

    FGF binds to FGFR3 on proliferating chondrocytes, which results in dimerization of FGFR3 and subsequent cross-phosphorylation.
    
    The resulting dimer, which has tyrosine kinase activity phosphorylates STAT-1 into phospho-STAT-1.
    
    Phospho-STAT-1 results in expression (transcriptional activation) of p21, a CIP (Cdk interacting protein, universal Cdk inhibitors), that inhibits Cdk-2/3 complexes.
    
    This inhibits cell cycle progress from G1 to S, and hence inhibits chondrocyte proliferation.
