- **Epidemiology of rotaviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Rotavirus is a community-acquired viral gastroenteritis with peak incidence in young children aged between 6 months to 2 years, particularly in winter and spring.
    
    Rotavirus is transmitted from person-to-person and indirectly via fomites.
    
    It is known for outbreaks in nurseries, day-care centres and hospital wards.
    
- **Pathogenesis of rotaviral gastroenteritis**
    
    It is mediated by malabsorption, resulting in unabsorpable osmotic substances within the intestinal lumen.
    
- **Clinical features of rotaviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Rotaviral gastroenteritis classically presents as:
    
    Vomiting (1-2 days) and diarrhoea (5 days), that puts the individual at risk at dehydration.
    
    It is accompanied with fever.
    
- **Diagnosis of rotaviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Nucleic acid-amplification - RT-PCR
    
    Antigen detection - ELISA
    
    Electron microscopy is no longer used for etiological diagnosis.
    
- **Management of rotaviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Supportive treatment and adequate hydration is required.
    
    Contact precaution is performed.
    
- **Prevention of rotavirus**
    
    Vaccine is available.
    

### Norovirus

- **Virology of norovirus**
- **Epidemiology of noroviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Norovirus is one of the commonest cause of viral gastroenteritis in the world.
    
    It is usually transmitted by food-bourne transmission (contaminated seafood), water-bourne transmission and person-to-person transmission via the feaco-oral route, or via aerosol from vomitus.
    
    It has a higher incidence in cooler months, hence also known as ‘winter vomiting disease’.
    
- **Pathogenesis of noroviral gastroenteritis**
    
    It is mediated by blunting of jejunal villi, and malabsorption.
    
- **Clinical features of noroviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Incubation period is around 12-48 hours, and lasts around 1-3 days. It clinically presents with:
    
    Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal cramps.
    
- **Diagnosis of noroviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Nucleic acid amplification - RT-PCR
    
- **Management of noroviral gastroenteritis**
    
    Supportive treatment is provided.
