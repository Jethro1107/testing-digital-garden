### Fluoroquinolones

Fluoroquinolones (and quinolones) are antibiotics that inhibit nucleic acid synthesis. They are *bactericidal*. However, there is an emerging fluoroquinolone resistance problem especially in Hong Kong.

- **MOA of quinolones and fluoroquinolones**
    
    Quinolones inhibit DNA synthesis by inhibiting DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV.
    
    Inhibition of DNA gyrase interferes with the uncoiling of DNA, thus inhibiting normal transcription and replication.
    
    Inhibition of topoisomerase IV interfers with the separation of replicated chromosomal DNA into respective cells during cell division.
    
- **Pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones**
    
    High oral bioavailability.
    
    High penetration into CNS.
    
    Mainly excreted via renal excretion, except for moxifloxacin, which undergoes biliary excretion.
    
- **Clinical use of fluoroquinones**
    
    Reserved for treating urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections caused by resistant strains of gram negative bacteria.
    
- Examples of quinolones and fluoroquinolones
    - 1st generation
        - **Examples of 1st generation quinolones**
            
            Nalidixic acid (unfluorinated)

        - **Spectrum of 1st generation quinolones**
            
            It has moderate gram negative activity, hence only used as a urinary anticeptic.
            
    - 2nd generation
        - **Examples of 2nd generation quinolones**
            
            Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Spectrum of 2nd generation quinolones**
            
            Expanded gram negative activity.
            
            Some activity against gram positive and atypical organisms.
            
    - 3rd generation
        - **Examples of 3rd generation quinolones**
            
            Levofloxacin
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Spectrum of 3rd generation quinolones**
            
            Expanded gram negative activity.
            
            Improved activity against gram positive and atypical organisms.
            
    - 4th generation
        - **Examples of 4th generation quinolones**
            
            Moxifloxacin
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
        - **Spectrum of 4th generation quinolones**
            
            Maintained gram negative activity.
            
            Improved gram positive activity.
            
            Gained anaerobe coverage.
            
- **Adverse effects of quinolones and fluoroquinolones**
    
    Quinolones and fluoroquinolones are generally safe.
    
    More common:
    
    GI disturbance - nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia
    
    CNS disturbance - Dizziness, headaches, insomnia
    
    Photosensitivity
    
    Less common:
    
    Tendon rupture - especially in elderly
    
    Arthropathy - in children, nursing mothers and pregnancy
    
    Peripheral neuropathy
    
    Hypersensitivity reaction
    
    Drug reaction - with cations (reduced absorption), antacids (reduced absorption), theophyline, warfarin
    
    Moxifloxacin can cause prolonged QT intervals, resulting in arrhythmias.
    
- **Mechanism of quinolone and fluoroquinolone resistance**
    1. Mutations of genes that encode for target enzymes (DNA gyrase and Topoisomerase IV)
    2. Reduced permeability of the outer membrane:
        
        Due to mutations in porin
        
        Change in outer membrane structure
        
    3. Increased efflux pumps
    4. Plasmid mediated resistance:
        
        Expression target protecting proteins
        
        Expression of drug modifying enzymes
