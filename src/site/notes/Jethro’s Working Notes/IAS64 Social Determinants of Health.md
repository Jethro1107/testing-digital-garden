- What is the framework in which social conditions affect individual health?
    
    Upstream factors such at societal conditions results in policy changes, altering the built environment of the individual, which would influence the individual's choice and behavior, ultimately affecting downstream individual health
    

### Social Determinants of Health and Health Inequalities

- What is the difference between health inequality and health inequity?
    
    Health inequality/disparity refers to differences in health between individuals and groups of people (Divided by social factors: age, gender, employment, income etc.)
    
    Health inequity refers to health inequalities that are deemed to be unfair
    
    Health inequality but not health inequity:
    
    Attributed to biological mechanisms or free choice
    
    e.g. Cancer and different age groups
    
    e.g. Lung cancer incidence and smokers vs non smokers
    
    Health inequality and health inequity:
    
    Attributed to conditions outside one's control
    
    e.g. Living conditions
    
- What is the socialeconomic gradient in health?
    
    People of lower socioeconomic status have worse health and health-related behavior
    
- What is the Gini Coefficient?
    
    Measurement of income distribution within a comunity
    
- What is the correlation between Income inequality and health?
    
    People of higher income group are generally more healthy than people of lower income group
    
    People from neighborhoods with less inequality are generally more healthy than people of lower income groups
    
- Compare absolute poverty and relative poverty.
    
    Absolute poverty - Insufficient money to meet basic needs such as food clothing and shelter
    
    Relative poverty - Amount of money sufficient to meet basic needs but cannot afford similar standards of living as everyone else in the society
    
- What is the poverty line in Hong Kong?
    
    Half of median household monthly income
    

### Pathways Social Factors Affect Health Outcomes

- What is the inverse care law?
    
    The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served. The Inverse Care Law operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced
    
    Hence, the inverse care law is observable in the private setting but not observable in the private setting
    
- What are the different pathways in which social factors affect health outcomes?
    
    Neo-material pathway - Emphasizes the relation between socioeconomic position and access to tangible material conditions (food, shelter, access to health service, harmful material), thus resulting in health inequality
    
    Psychological pathway - Emphasizes the relation between socio-economic position and psychological stress, thus resulting in health inequalities
    
    Cultural pathway - Emphasizes the relation between beliefs, knowledge and behaviors and health outcome
    
- What are the different perspectives to view the effects of social factors on health outcomes?
    
    Integrative perspective - Integrates the neo-material pathway, psychological pathway and cultural pathway in explaining health behaviors and health outcomes
    
    Lifecourse perspective - Health status of an individual reflects not only the contemporary conditions, but embodies prior living conditions across the individuals life course as well as across generations
    
- What are the implications on clinical practice?
    
    Physicians may have to deliberately inquire into the social conditions to understand patient behavior
