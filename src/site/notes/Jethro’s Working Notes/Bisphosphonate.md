### Bisphosphonate

Bisphosphonate is the first line treatment in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Treatment of osteoporosis\|Treatment of osteoporosis]] and the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteogenesis Imperfecta\|Osteogenesis Imperfecta]].

- ******************************************************Examples of bisphosphonates******************************************************
    
    Aledronate, Risedronate, Ibandronate, Zoledronate (parenteral)
    
- ******************************************MOA of bisphosphonate******************************************
    
    Bisphosphonate serves as pyrophosphate (mineralization inhibitors) analogs.
    
    It bind to bone matrix, resulting in osteoclast apoptosis and inhibits osteoclast functions, resulting in antiresorptic effects.
    
    This results in increase in bone mineral density.
    
- ********************Pharmacokinetics and clinical use of bisphosphonate********************
    
    Bisphosphonate has poor oral bioavailability:
    
    - It is taken in the morning, after an overnight fast and at least 30 minutes before breakfast, with a full glass of water, which promotes absorption.
    - Individuals are also asked to stand up to promote absorption.
- ******************************************************************Adverse effects of bisphosphonate******************************************************************
    - Esophageal and gastrointestinal irritation
    - Musculoskeletal pain
    - Severe adverse effects, which are a result of prolonged suppression of bone resorption include:
        - Osteonecrosis of the jaw
        - Atypical femoral fractures
- ************************************************************Precautions of bisphosphonates************************************************************
    
    Bisphosphonates are avoided in:
    
    - Growing childrens and pregnancy
    - Oral formulations are avoided with esophageal or upper GI disorders
    - Oral formulations are avoided with comorbidities inhibiting prolonged standing
    - Renal insufficiency
    
    As bisphosphonates accumulate in bone and are slowly released, it may result in over-suppression of osteoclastic activity, which can result in atypical femoral fracture.
    
    - Hence, a drug holiday is required for long term use of bisphosphonate.
