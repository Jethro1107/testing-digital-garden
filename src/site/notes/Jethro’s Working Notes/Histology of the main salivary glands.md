### Histology of the main salivary glands

There are essentially three paired main salivary glands: 1) Parotid glands, 2) Submandibular glands, and 3) Sublingual glands.

- **The main salivary glands share the same histological architecture, that is:**
    
    A thick connect tissue capsule surrounds the parenchyma.
    
    The capsule forms extended septa that extends into the parenchyma, separating the parenchyma into larger lobes and smaller lobules.
    
    The parenchyma is made of a secretory acini ([[  There are 3 types of secretory acini in the salivary glands  \|  There are 3 types of secretory acini in the salivary glands  ]]) that produces the secretions, and a ductal system, that delivers the secretions to the oral cavity.
    
    - **The ductal system are a network of ducts that empty into the oral cavity:**
        
        The intralobular ductal system consist of intercalated ducts and striated ducts.
        
        The secretory acini first empty into the intercalated ducts, that are lined by a simple columnar epithelium.

        Several intercalated ducts empty into the striated ducts, that are lined by a simple columnar epithelium. They are said to be ‘striated’ as they consist of numerous basal infoldings associated with mitochondria ([[IAS27  Epithelial and Glandular Tissues \|IAS27  Epithelial and Glandular Tissues ]]) that results in faint basal striations projecting towards the nucleus.

        Eventually, secretions empty from the intralobular ductal system into the interobular ducts and into the interobar ducts. There is a transition of epithelium from a simple columnar, to stratified cuboidal, to stratified columnar epithelium.

Myoepithelial cells are located at the basement membrane of the glandular epithelium of the three main salivary glands. The prefix, ‘myo-’ indicates that it is contractile, which facilitates secretion into the ductal system.

### Distinct features of the main salivary glands

The three main salivary glands varies histologically and functionally, mainly in secretory acini.

- **Parotid glands**
    
    The parotid glands are the largest salivary glands.
    
    They mainly consist of serous acini.

- **Submandibular glands**
    
    The submandibular glands mainly consist of mucous acini, but also consist of serous demilunes.

- **Sublingual glands**
    
    All three types of secretory acini, but predominantly consist of serous demilunes
