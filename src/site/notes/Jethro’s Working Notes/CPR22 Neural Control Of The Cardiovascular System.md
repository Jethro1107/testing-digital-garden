                                - Cardiac conduction system
                                    - Action of the cardiac conduction system ↓
            - Parameters controlled by cardiac muscle contractions ↓
                - Heart rate and stroke volume, and hence cardiac output and thus arterial pressure
        - Smooth muscles of blood vessels
            - Nature of vascular smooth muscles ↓
                - Tonic, i.e. sustained degree of contraction of smooth muscles
            - Effects of vascular smooth muscles on blood pressure ↓
                - Increasing degree of contraction, i.e. vasoconstriction, results in increased blood pressure
                - Decreasing degree of contraction, i.e. vasodilation, results in decreased blood pressure

            - Structure of baroreceptors relating to its mechanism ↓
                - Consist of nerve endings at the walls of blood vessels, which detect for distention of the walls
                - High blood pressure distends the walls of blood vessels, which deforms the receptors, resulting in increased firing of baroreceptors

                    - Aortic arch
                    - Carotid sinus - a very distensible portion of the wall of the internal carotid artery located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery into the external and internal carotid arteries
        - Chemoreceptors
            - Function of chemoreceptors ↓
                - Responds a chemical stimulus, a change in PO2 (only in peripheral chemoreceptors), PCO2, and pH

                - Location of central chemoreceptors: ↓
                    - Hypothalamus, ventral surface of medulla, cerebrum
- Afferent pathways in neural control of the cardiovascular system
    - Afferent pathways of carotid receptors ↓
        - Baroreceptors at carotid sinus and chemoreceptors in carotid bodies join the [[Glossopharyngeal Nerve\|Glossopharyngeal Nerve]] (CN IX), which enter the medulla oblongata
    - Afferent pathways of aortic receptors ↓
        - Baroreceptors at the aortic arch and chemoreceptors in aortic bodies join the [[Vagus Nerve\|Vagus Nerve]] (CN X), which enter the medulla oblongata

        - Both consist of 2 ganglion, the superior and inferior ganglion
        - Cell bodies are usually located in the inferior ganglion
- Central nervous system in neural control of the cardiovascular system
    - Nucleus in the medulla involved in cardiovascular control ↓
        - Nucleus tractus solitarii (Nucleus of solitary tract): ↓
            - Afferent sensory fibres in [[Glossopharyngeal Nerve\|Glossopharyngeal Nerve]] and vagus nerve enter the nucleus of solitary tract
        - Dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve: ↓
            - Afferent fibres in [[Glossopharyngeal Nerve\|Glossopharyngeal Nerve]] and vagus nerve enter the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve
            - Efferent parasympathetic fibres arise from dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve and run along [[Vagus Nerve\|Vagus Nerve]]
        - Nucleus ambiguus: ↓
            - Common nucleus of the efferent parasympathetic fibres for [[Glossopharyngeal Nerve\|Glossopharyngeal Nerve]] and [[Vagus Nerve\|Vagus Nerve]]
- Efferent pathways in neural control of the cardiovascular system
    - [[Parasympathetic Efferents\|Parasympathetic Efferents]] in [[Neural Control Of The Heart\|Neural Control Of The Heart]] ↓
        - Nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) feeds into the dorsal motor neurons of the vagus nerve and the nucleus ambiguus, in which the axons of neurons in these nucleus are preganglionic parasympathetic fibres in the [[Vagus Nerve\|Vagus Nerve]] and provides the parasympathetic innervation to the heart
    - Integration between paraympathetic pathway and sympathetic pathways in [[Neural Control Of The Heart\|Neural Control Of The Heart]] ↓
        - Inhibitory interneurons in nucleus of solitary tract inhibit the caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla, which consist of bulbospinal neurons that send axons that synapse with the sympathetic preganglionic neurons

    - Receptors and neurotransmitters in neural control of the cardiovascular system
        - Neurotransmitter-receptor pair between preganglionic neuron and ganglionic neuron in sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ↓
            - Preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), which bind to N2 (nicotinic) receptors on postganglionic neurons
        - Location of ganglions in sympathetic and parasympathetic control of cardiovascular system ↓
            - Sympathetic ganglion in sympathetic trunk
            - Parasympathetic ganglion on wall of heart #[[Fact check\|Fact check]]
        - Postganglionic neurons neurotransmitters and receptors in sympathetic and parasympathetic control of cardiovascular system ↓
            - Sympathetic division: ↓
                - Postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine, which bind to beta-1 receptors on cardiac pacemaker cells (SA node) and myocardial contractile cells
                - Norepinephrine also binds to alpha-1 receptor on blood vessels
                - Preganglionic neurons also synapse with adrenal medulla, which releases epinephrine into circulation
            - Parasympathetic division: ↓
                - Postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine, which bind to M2 (muscarinic) receptors on cardiac pacemaker cells
    - Response to increase in arterial pressure ↓
        - Baroreceptors stimulated, which increases parasympathetic activity and reduces sympathetic activity
        - This results in decreased [[Cardiac Output\|Cardiac Output]]
        - This also results in vasodilation (due to reduced sympathetic activity), and hence reduced total peripheral resistance
        - Hence, arterial pressure decreases
    - Response to reduced PO2, increased PCO2 and/or reduced pH ↓
        - Chemoreceptors are stimulated
        - This results in an increase in sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity
        - This results in an increase in cardiac output
        - This also results in vasoconstriction and increase in total peripheral resistnace
        - Hence, arterial pressure increases
        - Note that an intrinsic cardiovascular response to the change in chemical profile is bradycardia, as stimulated chemoreceptors exert a positive drive on the parasympathetic activity
        - However, stimulated chemoreceptors stimulate the medulla respiratory centre to stimulate ventilation, which stimulates lung stretch receptor
        - The afferent fibres of stretch receptors inhibit the parasympathetic activity and thus stimulates reflex tachycardia
