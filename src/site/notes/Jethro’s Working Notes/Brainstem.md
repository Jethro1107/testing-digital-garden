# Brainstem

The brainstem consist of 3 regions, from superior to inferior: 1) **midbrain**, **pons** and **medulla oblongata**. 
Similar to any location of the [[Central nervous system\|Central nervous system]], it consists of collections of cell bodies (nucleus), and axonal fibres. It connects the brain and the spinal cord.
To put it simply, the brain stem is the *spinal cord of the head and neck*.

### Major functions of the Brainstem
1. The brainstem conveys the ascending and descending pathways.
2. The brainstem consists of cranial nerve nuclei.
3. Many important life centres are located in the brainstem, either the cranial nerve nuclei, or the [[Reticular formation\|Reticular formation]].

For full understanding of the brainstem, one must acquire a general framework for *what is there* and *where it is*.

### What is in the brain stem?
1. Descending pathways: the corticospinl tract
2. Ascending pathways: dorsal-medial lemniscus tract, spinothalamic tract
3. Cranial nerve nuclei and cerebellar peduncle
4. Connections with the cerebellum: The 3 cerebellar peduncles
5. [[Reticular formation\|Reticular formation]] and reticular-activating systems
