### Immunity Against Infectious Agents

- What are the types of immunity by specificity?
    
    Innate immunity: Non-specific
    
    Adaptive immunity: Specific
    
- What are the characteristics of adaptive immunity?
    
    Antigen specific
    
    Diverse repertoire
    
    Immunological memory
    
    Self and non self discrimination
    
- What are the characteristics of a secondary immune response?
    
    Faster - Shorter lag phase (1-4 days) and early peak (3-5 days)
    
    Stronger - Qualitative (Improve antibody affinity by somatic hypermutation) and Quantitative (More antibodies produced) increase
    
    Last longer - Slower decline 
    
- What are the characteristics of a secondary antibody response?
    
    Only applies to T-dependent antibody response (for protein antigen), in which antibody production requires Th help
    
    Antigen recognition occurs in bone marrow rather than in peripheral lymphoid organs, as affinity maturation and isotype switching occurs in proliferating B cells
    
    High antibody affinity
    
    Class switch - IgM to IgG
    
- What contributes to the higher quality (higher affinity) of antibody produced in secondary antibody response?
    
    Somatic hypermutation
    
    Somatic hypermutation occurs in the variable region of heavy chains (V, D, J genes involved) and light chain (V, J genes involved)
    
    Hypermutation may result in antibody whose Fab region has higher affinity to antigen
    
- Describe the process of antibody class switch in secondary immune response.
    
    Switch from IgM to IgG 
    
    Due to a change in the Fc region of the antibody

- What are the two types of immune response by acting agents?
    
    Humoral - Immune response mediated by molecules
    
    Cellular - Immune response mediated by cells
    
- Classify humoral immunity and the actions.
    
    Non-specific:
    
    Complement
    
    APP
    
    Interferons
    
    Specific:
    
    Antibodies - Neutralization, Opsonization, Complement activation, Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
    
- Classify cell-mediated immunity and their actions.
    
    Non-specific:
    
    Phagocytes - Macrophages, Neutrophils
    
    NK cells
    
    Specific:
    
    T cells - CTL, HTL
    
- How are T cells further classified? What are the functions of the different T cells? Elaborate on the mechanisms of their functions.
    
    CD8+ T cells - Killing infected cells:
    
    TCR on CD8+ T cells are activated by epitope presented on MHC class 1 molecule on APC
    
    Activated CD8+ T cells can synthesize cytotoxic granules
    
    Upon recognition of epitope on MHC class 1 molecule of a target cell (virus infected cell), CD8+ T cells release cytotoxic granules
    
    Cytotoxic granules contain perforin and granzymes
    
    Perforin forms pores on the target cell, causing osmotic lysis, and also allows entry of granzymes
    
    Granzymes induce apoptosis
    
    CD4+ T cells - Releasing cytokines:
    
    Th1: IL-2, IFN-gamma - Promotes Type 4 (delayed) hypersensitivity
    
    Th2: IL-4, IL-10 - Promotes type 1 immediate hypersensitivity
    
    Th17: IL-17 - Pro-inflammatory
    
- What happens to CD4+ T cells in HIV infection?
    
    Decrease in quantity
    
- Describe the process of T-dependent macrophage activation.
    
    Macrophages release IL-12 that activate Th1
    
    Activated Th1 releases IFN-gamma that activate macrophages, increasing MHC expression, phagolysosome fusion and NO synthesis
    
- Classify interferons and state their functions.
    
    Type 1 (alpha and beta), from virus infected cells - Induce antiviral state of cells, activate NK cells, enhance MHC class I expression
    
    Type 2 (gamma), from NK cells and T cells - Induce antiviral state of cells, activate macrophages, stimulate IL-12 production, stimulate NO production, Enhance MHC Class I/II expression, kill infected cells directly
    
- Describe the process of cytokine-mediated direct cell killing.
    
    Target cell integrate signals of TNF and IFN-gamma to induce apoptosis
    
- What are the two types of natural killer cells?
    
    CD16+CD56dim/neg - Cytotoxic (90%)
    
    CD16-CD56bright - Regulatory/cytokine releasing
    
- What are the different mechanisms of phagocyte-mediated killing of microorganisms.
    
    Reactive oxygen intermediates
    
    Reactive nitrogen intermediates
    
    Other mediators e.g. Lysozyme, prostaglandins
    
    Cytokines: TNF, IFN-gamma
    

### Immunodeficiencies

- What are the two types of immunodeficiencies?
    
    Primary immunodeficiencies - Intrinsic, genetically linked
    
    Secondary immunodeficiencies - Extrinsic, acquired
    
- What are the two types of infections that occur in immunodeficient hosts?
    
    Recurrent infection, opportunistic infection
    

### Immunity against 'Non-self'

- What is anti-tumor immunity?
    
    Our immune system frequently kills cancer cell
    
- How do tumors escape the immune system?
    
    Lack molecules important in immunity
    
    Tumor-derived factors suppress immunity
    
- What is hypersensitivity? What is autoimmunity?
    
    Hypersensitivity - A state of heightened reactivity to innocuous antigens (allergens)
    
    Autoimmunity - An adaptive immune response directed against self antigens
    
- How is self-tolerance developed?
    
    Central tolerance (Thymic education)
    
    Peripheral tolerance (Failed-safe-mechanisms)
