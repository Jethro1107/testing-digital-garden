### Bones and joints of the lower limb

The bony framework of the gluteal region includes the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pelvic girdle\|Pelvic girdle]] and the head of the femur. The pelvic girdle articulates to the axial skeleton at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Sacroiliac joint\|Sacroiliac joint]], whereas the left and right girdle articulate with each other at the pubic symphysis (cartiligeous joint).

The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hip joint\|Hip joint]] serves as the articular site between the femur and the pelvic girdle.

The bony framework of the thigh includes the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femur\|Femur]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Patella\|Patella]] and the proximal ends of fibula and tibia. Important joints in this region include:

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Knee joint\|Knee joint]]

The bony frameworks of the leg includes the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tibia\|Tibia]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Fibula\|Fibula]]. They are connected at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tibiofibular joint\|Tibiofibular joint]].

Important joints in this region include:

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ankle joint\|Ankle joint]]

The bony framework of the fut include the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot\|Bones of the foot and the arches of the foot]]. Note the [[Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex\|Subtalar-talonavicular (STTN) [[complex]] complex]] and its associations with [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ankle inversion and eversion injuries\|Ankle inversion and eversion injuries]].

The arches of the foot are supported by [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Plantar ligaments that support the foot arches\|Plantar ligaments that support the foot arches]].

### Innervation of the Lower limb

### Blood supply of the lower limb

******************************************************************Arterial supply of the lower limb******************************************************************

Arterial supply of the lower limb starts at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femoral artery\|Femoral artery]], which is the continuation of the external iliac artery, as it crosses the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Inguinal ligament\|Inguinal ligament]].

The femoral artery then continues as the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Popliteal artery\|Popliteal artery]], which branches into the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterior tibial artery\|Anterior tibial artery]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior tibial artery\|Posterior tibial artery]].

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Deep veins of the lower limb follow the same naming conventions of the arterial supply of the lower limb.******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
