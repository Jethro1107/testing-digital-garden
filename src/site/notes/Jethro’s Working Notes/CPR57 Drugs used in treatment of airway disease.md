### Drugs in treatment for asthma

- **Therapeutic goals for treating asthma**
    1. Bronchodilation
    2. Decrease inflammatory response
- Bronchodilators
    - Beta-2 receptor agonist (First line drug in asthma therapy)
        - **Types and examples of beta-2 agonist in asthma therapy**
            
            Short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) - Salbutalol, terbutaline
            
            Long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) - Salmeterol, Formoterol
            
        - **MOA of beta-2 agonist in asthma therapy**
            
            Binds to beta-2 receptor on smooth muscle cells, resulting in activation of adenyl cyclase, resulting in increased cAMP production
            
            cAMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylate MLCK, causing decreased MLCK activity
            
            This results in smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation
            
            It also decreases vascular permeability and oedema
            
            It stimulates airway clearance by stimulating mucocilliary apparatus
            
        - **Benefits and use cases of SABA and LABA**
            
            SABA:
            
            4-6 hours 
            
            Rapid relief of symptoms during exacerbations
            
            LABA:
            
            >12 hours
            
            Less symptoms and exacerbations
            
            Improved quality of life

        - **Adverse effects of beta-2 receptor agonist**
            
            Tachycardia
            
            Tremors
            
            Hypokalemia (due to increased Na+/K+ pump)
            
            Development of:
            
            Dessensitization (tachyphylaxis and tolerance) - due to uncoupling of G proteins
            
            Down-regulation of Beta-2 receptors - due to degradation of receptors
            
    - Phosphodiesterase inhibitors/Methylxanthine (Second line drug in asthma therapy)
        - **Examples of PDE inhibitors in asthma therapy**
            
            Theophylline, aminophylline
            
        - **MOA of PDE inhibitors**
            
            Inhibit PDE:
            
            PDE inhibitors inhibits breakdown of cAMP into 5’-AMP by PDE
            
            This results in increased cAMP levels, activating protein kinase A
            
            Protein kinase A phosphorylates MLCK, resulting in decreased MLCK activity, resulting in relaxation and bronchodilations
            
            Block adenosine receptors:
            
            Prevents mast cell degranulation and histamine release
            
            Prevent contraction of smooth muscles
            
        - **Adverse effects of PDE inhibitors**
            
            CNS effect - cause nervousness
            
            Cardiovascular effect - chronotropic and inotropic effects
            
            GI effects - stimulate secretion by GI tract, causing nausea and vomiting
            
            Kidney - Diuresis
            
    - Muscarinic receptor antagonist
        - **Types and examples of muscarinic receptor antagonists**

            Long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) - tiotropium
            
        - **MOA of muscarinic receptor antagonists**
            
            Block muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscles, thus decreasing vagal cholinergic activity
            
            This causes decreased mucus secretion and decreased bronchoconstriction
            
        - **Adverse effects of muscarinic receptor antagonist**
            
            Dry mouth
            
            Irritating cough
            
- Leukotriene pathway modifiers
    - **Types and examples of Leukotriene pathway modifiers in asthma therapy**
        
        Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists - Montelukast, Zafirlukast
        
        5-lipoxygenase inhibitors - Zileuton
        
    - **MOA of different types of leukotriene pathway modifiers in asthma therapy**
        
        Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists:
        
        Block LTC4 and LTD4 receptors to prevent LTC4 and LTD4 mediated bronchospasm
        
        5-lipoxygenase inhibitors:
        
        Inhibits sinthesis of leukotrienes to inhibit bronchospasm
        
    - **Clinical use of leukotriene pathway modifiers**

        Nausea
        
        Diarrhea
        
        Headaches
        
- Antiinflammatory drugs (glococortisoids)
    - **MOA of glucocortisoids in asthma therapy**
        
        Gluccocortisoids bind to gluccosteroid receptors, resulting in several effects:
        
        Broad anti-inflammatory actions:
        
        Decrease synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells and macrophages
        
        Decrease number and activity of inflammatory cells
        
        Decreased oedema of the airway mucosa
        
        Decreased mucus production
        
        Increased expression of beta-2 receptors on airway smooth muscles and their responsiveness to beta-2 agonists:
        
        Thus preventing desensitization and decreased number of beta-2 receptors as a result of beta-2 receptor agonist therapy

        - Anti-IL-4 therapy agents
            - **Examples of anti-IL-4 therapy agents**
                
                Dupilumab

### Drugs in management for COPD

- **Goals for managing COPD**
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2022-03-30 at 11.29.06 AM.png\|/Screenshot 2022-03-30 at 11.29.06 AM.png]]
    
- Bronchodilators
    - Beta-2 agonist
        - **Beta-2 agonist used in COPD and not asthma**
            
            Ultra long acting beta-2 agonist - Indacaterol
            
    - Muscarinic antagonist
        - **Muscarinic antagonist used in COPD and not asthma**
            
            Ultra long acting muscarinic antagonist - Glycopyrronium
            
- Antiinflammatory drugs
    - Glucocortisoids
        - **Mechanism for glucocortisoid resistance in COPD**
            
            In normal conditions:
            
            Glucocortisoids stimulate HDAC3 (histone deacetylase) which reverses histone acetylation by NF-keppaB, thus decreasing the activity of NF-keppaB
            
            Thus decreasing expression of IL-8 and TNF-alpha
            
            In COPD:
            
            Oxidative stress from cigarette smoke (peroxynitrite) reacts with HDAC3, thus it cannot reverse histone acetylation by NF-keppaB
            
            ![[/Screenshot 2022-03-30 at 11.52.18 AM.png\|/Screenshot 2022-03-30 at 11.52.18 AM.png]]
            
    - Selective PDE4 inhibitors
        - **Examples of PDE4 inhibitors in COPD management**
            
            Roflumilast
            
        - **MOA of PDE4 inhibitors**
            
            Inhibits cytokine release by neutrophils and macrophages, thus results in antiinflammatory effect
            
    - Theophylline (still in clinical trial)
- Combined therapy in COPD management
    - Dual therapy
        
        Muscarinic antagonist + beta-2 agonist
        
        Glucocorticoids + beta-2 agonists (less effective for COPD due to glucocortisoid resistance in COPD)
