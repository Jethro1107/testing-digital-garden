### Factors affecting local anaesthetic effects of LA

The factors affecting local anaesthetic effects of LA can be classified into nerves, agents, adjunct, and patient.

### Nerves

1. *Nerve type*
    
    LA preferentially block smaller Type C fibres (e.g. pain fibres), followed by Type B fibres (preganglionic sympathetic) followed by Type A fibres (motor)
    
2. *****************Fibre orientation*****************
    
    LA preferentially block nerve fibres in the outer periphery than the core of the trunk. Usually, sensory fibres are located at the periphery, while motor fibres are located at the core.
    
3. ***************Fibre diameter***************
    
    LA preferentially block smaller fibres.
    
    Larger fibres requires more LA to block it, and inhibition at 3 successive nodes of Ranvier for effective blockade.
    
4. ****************Firing frequency****************
    
    LA preferentially block fibres with high firing frequency (pain fibres tend to increase firing when stimulated).
    

### Agent

1. ******Amount******
    
    Increase in dose results in increase in local concentration of LA, thus increasing its effects.
    
2. ***************Protein binding***************
    
    Increase in protein binding enables it to strongly bind to voltage-gated Na+ channels, thus increasing its effects.
    
    It also slows down systemic absorption.
    
    It also indicates a higher binding to [[a1-acid glycoproteins\|a1-acid glycoproteins]] in plasma.
    
3. ****************Lipid solubility****************
    
    Increase in lipid solubility of the agent facilitates diffusion across myelin and plasma membrane of the nerve fibre, thus increasing its effects, and potency.
    
4. ********************Degree of ionization********************
    
    Closer pKa of the agent to physiological pH, results in a greater unionised fraction, which can diffuse across the myelin sheath and plasma membrane of the nerve fibre, thus increasing its effects.
    

### Adjunct

1. ***********************Epinephrine / Adrenaline***********************
    
    Adrenaline stimulates vasoconstriction, thus reducing systemic absorption of LA, increasing LA effects in terms of both duration and potency, while limiting peak plasma drug levels.

2. ******************Sodium bicarbonate******************
    
    Alkalisation results in an increase in unionised fraction, which facilitates diffusion across myelin sheath and plasma membrane of nerve fibres, thus increasing its effects.
    
3. *************Hyaluronidase*************
    
    Hyaluronidase increases uptake into nerves.
    

### Patient

1. ***Age***
    
    Older people have reduced hepatic functions, results in reduced alpha1 acid glycoprotein, resulting in increased proportion of free drugs.
    
2. ************Electrolytes************
    
    Hyperkalaemia
    
3. *********Acid base*********
    
    Acidosis results in increase in free drug fraction, which can potentiate LA toxicity.
    
4. *Comorbidities*
    
    Hepatic and renal impairments reduce drug metabolism and elimination, thus prolonging LA duration of action.
    
5. ***Others (e.g. pregnancy)***
