## Anatomy of the Lungs and Pleura

### General structure of the lungs

- How many lobes do the two lungs have? What are the names of the lobes?
    
    The **right lung** has 3 lobes - The right upper lobe, the right middle lobe, and the right lower lobe. The right lower lobe, when visualizing anteriorly, looks small (it is almost not visible), but in fact, is the largest lobe of the right lung, much of it sits posteriorly.
    
    The **left lung** has 2 lobes - The left upper lobe, and the left lower lobe
    
- What is the blood supply of the lungs?
    
    Supplied by the bronchial artery and vein, which supply:
    
    The lung parenchyma, the bronchi and the visceral pleura
    

- **Nerve supply of the lungs**
    
    Lung is innervated by the **pulmonary plexus**, consisting of:
    
    Sympathetic fibres arising from **T2 to T5** providing **sympathetic innervation**, and
    
    **Vagus Nerve** (CN X) providing **parasympathetic innervation**
    
- What is present within the lung hilum? Describe the general orientation of these structures.
    
    Structures with the **lung hilum**:
    
    1. Pulmonary artery
    2. Pulmonary veins
    3. Lymph nodes
    4. Nerves
    5. Bronchus
    6. Bronchial arteries and veins
    
    The **general arrangement** of the structures is as follows:
    
    **Pulmonary artery** - Superiormost on the left hilum
    
    **Superior and inferior pulmonary vein** - anteriormost and inferiormost respectively
    
    **Bronchus** - against and approximately in the middle of the posterior boundary
    
    [[(Moore’s Clinically Oriented Anatomy p.120-121)\|(Moore’s Clinically Oriented Anatomy p.120-121)]]
    
- Describe the lymphatic drainage of the lungs.
    
    Understanding of Lymphatic drainage of the lungs is vital for understanding the metastasis via the lymphatic route
    
    **Superficial lymph nodes/ plexus** is located beneath the visceral pleura, and drains interstitial fluid in the superficial lung parenchyma and visceral pleura, which drains directly into the **bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes** on the hilum of the lungs
    
    **Deep lymph plexus** is located in the submucosa of the bronchi, which drains into the **pulmonary node**, and eventually into the **bronchopulmonary nodes**
    
    The **bronchopulonary node** then drains into the **tracheobronchial node**
    
    The **tracheobronchial node** then drains into the **paratracheal node**
    
    **Right paratracheal node** drain into the **right bronchomediastinal lymphatic trunk**, which would then drain into the **right lymphatic duct**
    
    The **left paratracheal node** drain into the **left bronchomediastinal lymphatic trunk**, which would then drain into the **thoracic duct**

### Pleura

- What are the 2 pleural layers in the pulmonary cavities? Are they two distinctive layers?
    
    The two pleural layers are the **visceral pleura** and the **parietal pleura**
    
    The visceral pleura adheres the surface of the lungs, while the parietal pleura adheres to the thoracic wallWha
    
    The visceral pleura and the parietal pleura are **continuous** layers:
    
    The visceral pleura is continuous with the parietal pleura at the hilum of the lung
    
    [[(Moore’s Clinically Oriented Anatomy p.114)\|(Moore’s Clinically Oriented Anatomy p.114)]]
    
- What are fissures? How are they formed?
    
    Fissures are 2 folds of visceral pleura, as the visceral pleura envelopes each lobe
    
    The **left lobe**, only having 2 lobes, will have 1 fissure, the obliques fissure
    
    The **right lobe**, having three lobes, will have 2 fissures:
    
    The horizontal fissure separates the right upper lung and the right middle lung
    
    The obliques fissure separates the right middle lung and the right lower lung
    
- What is the layer of connective tissue between the internal thoracic wall and parietal pleura?
    
    **Endothoracic fascia** - A layer of loose connective tissue connecting inner chest wall and the parietal pleura
    
- What is the nerve supply of the pleura?
    
    The **visceral pleura** is innervated by the pulmonary plexus (T2-T5 sympathetic fibres, vagus nerve)
    
    The **parietal pleura** is innervated by intercostal nerves, except the **central diaphragmatic and mediastinal pleura**, which are innervated by the phrenic nerve
    
- Describe the surface anatomy of pleura and lungs.
    
    Along imaginary lines such as the **mid-clavicular line, mid-axillary line and the posterior paravertebral line**, the lower border of the lungs and the parietal pleura can be determined
    
    When the **mid-clavicular line** is used:
    
    The **lung** is located at the 6th rib
    
    The **parietal pleura** is located at the 10th rib
    
    When the **mid-axillary line** is used:
    
    The **lung** is located at the 8th rib
    
    The **parietal pleura** is located at the 10th rib
    
    When the **posterior paravertebral line** is used:
    
    The **lung** is located at the 10th rib
    
    The **parietal pleura** is located at the 12th rib
