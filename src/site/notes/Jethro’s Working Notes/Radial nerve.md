### Radial nerve

The radial nerve is the large terminal [[The posterior cord of the brachial plexus gives off 5 branches\|The posterior cord of the brachial plexus gives off 5 branches]] (C6-T1). 

It descends along the posterior wall of the axilla, and leave the axilla to access the posterior scapulae sapce via the triquetral interval.

- ********************In the arm********************
    
    It then courses through the radial nerve on the posterior surface of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Humerus\|Humerus]] (largely between the origin of the lateral medial heads of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Triceps brachii\|Triceps brachii]]). It then pierces through the lateral intermuscular septum to access the anterior compartment, or more specifically, the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cubital fossa\|Cubital fossa]].
    
    Here, the radial nerve provides:
    
    - Motor innervation to the posterior compartment of the arm, i.e. the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Triceps brachii\|Triceps brachii]]
    - Sensory innervation of the posterior surface of the arm, via the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm

- ****************************************In the cubital fossa****************************************
    
    In the cubital fossa, the radial nerve gives rise to two branches, the deep branch (Dorsal interosseus nerve) and the superficial branch.
    
- **********************************************In the forearm and hand**********************************************
    
    The deep branch leaves the cubital fossa through the two layers of the supinator, and provides motor innervation to the muscles of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Posterior compartment of the forearm\|Posterior compartment of the forearm]].
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
    The superficial branch courses deep along the brachioradialis and emerges from the anatomical snuff box, and provides sensory innervation to the dorsal surface of the lateral 3 and a half digits and associated dorsum of the hand.

- **************************************************************Innervation of the radial nerve**************************************************************
    
    The radial nerve innervates all of the muscles in the posterior compartment of the arm and forearm.
    
    It also provides sensory innervation to the posterior surface of the arm and forearm, and to a small area on the dorsum of the hand, dorsal surface of the lateral 3 and a half digits and associated areas on the dorsum of the hand.
