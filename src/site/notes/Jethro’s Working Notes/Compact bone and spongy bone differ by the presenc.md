### Compact bone and spongy bone differ by the presence of cavities

Compact bone and spongy bone is a *gross distinction*, compact bone consist of no cavities between [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bone tissue\|Bone tissue]], while spongy bone consist of interconnected cavities (marrow cavity) between the bone tissue.

For most bones:

- The diaphyses is made of predominantly compact bones.
- The epiphyses is made of spongy bone at the core, surrounded by a layer of compact bone.

### Compact bone

Gross examination of compact bone shows no cavities.

The anatomical and functional unit of compact bone is an osteon (Harvesian system), that consist of concentric lamellae of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bone tissue\|Bone tissue]] surrounding a Harvesian canal, which contains neurovascular structures and loose connective tissues.

Harvesian systems communicate with each other by perforating canals (Volkmann’s canal), which is not surrounded by concentric lamellae of bone tissue. Together, they supply nutrients to [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteocyte\|Osteocyte]]s via cannaliculi.

Histologically, Harvesian system/ Osteon overlap one another due to constant bone remodelling.

### Spongy bone

Gross examination of spongy bones shows dense interconnected cavities.

The anatomical and functional unit of spongy bone is  a trabecula, consisting of anastamosing bony spicules, that surrounds the marrow cavity.

The marrow cavity it surrounds is highly vascular and consist of ***************red bone marrow***************, enabling mainly metabolic functions:

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Haematopoiesis\|Haematopoiesis]]
- Maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis

Relative to compact bone, it is weaker, more flexible and has a greater surface area.

### Spongy bone and compact bone are interconvertible.
