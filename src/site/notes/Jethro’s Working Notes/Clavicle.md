### Clavicle

The clavicle, part of the pectorial girdle is classified as a long bone (despite lacking a medullary region).

It is an S-shaped bone, where the medial two-thirds concaves anteriorly, and the lateral one thirds convexes anteriorly.

The superior surface is relatively smooth, whereas the inferior surface is marked by elevations and grooves:

- Medial (to the sternal end of the clavicle), the costal tubercle is present, the site of attachment of costoclavicular ligament, which stabilize the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Sternoclavicular joint\|Sternoclavicular joint]].
- In the middle, the groove for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Subclavius\|Subclavius]] is present.
- Lateral (to the acromial end of the clavicle), the medial conoid process and lateral trapezoid line is present, for the attachment of coracoclavicular ligament, which stabilize the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Acromioclavicular joint\|Acromioclavicular joint]].

- **Articulation of the clavicle**
    
    The sternal end of the clavicle articulates with the manubrium of the sternum at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Sternoclavicular joint\|Sternoclavicular joint]]  - It forms the only bony attachment of the upper limb to the trunk.
    
    The acromial end of the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapulae at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Acromioclavicular joint\|Acromioclavicular joint]].
