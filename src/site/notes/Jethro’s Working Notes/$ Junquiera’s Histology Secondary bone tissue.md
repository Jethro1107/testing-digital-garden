**Secondary Bone Tissue**

[S](http://Secondarybonetissueisthetypeusuallyfoundinadults.It)econdary bone tissue is the tissue type found in adults. It characteristically shows multiple layers ofcalcified matrix (each 3–7 m thick)and is often referred to as **lamellar bone**. The lamellae are quite organized, either parallel to each other or concentrically around a vascular canal. Each complex of concentric bony lamellae
surrounding a small canal containing blood vessels, nerves, and loose connective tissue is called an **osteon** (formerly known as an **haversian system**) (Figures 8–1
and 8–9). Lacunae with osteocytes are found between the lamellae, interconnected by canaliculi which allow all cells to be in contact with the source of nutrients and
oxygen in the osteonic canal (Figure 8–9). The outer boundary of each osteon is a more collagen-rich layer called the **cement line**.

**An osteon.**

In preparations of dried, ground bone osteons can be seen with lacunae (L) situated between concentric lamellae and interconnected by fine canaliculi (C). Although it is
not apparent by light microscopy, each lamella consists of multiple parallel arrays of collagen fibers. In adjacent lamellae, the collagen fibers are oriented in different
directions. The presence of large numbers of lamellae with differing fiber orientations provides the bone with great strength, despite its light weight. Only remnants of the
osteocytes (O) in some lacunae and of the osteonic canal's contents are seen in ground bone. In living tissue osteocytic processes connected via gap junctions are present
in successive canaliculi, making cells in all the lamellae in communication with the blood vessels in the central canal. X500.

In each lamella, type I collagen fibers are aligned in parallel and follow a helical course. The pitch of the helix is, however, different for different lamellae, so that at
any given point, fibers from adjacent lamellae intersect at approximately right angles (Figure 8–1). The specific organization of collagen fibers in successive lamellae
of each osteon is highly important for the great strength of secondary bone.

In compact bone (eg, the diaphysis of long bones) besides forming osteons, the lamellae also exhibit a typical organization consisting of multiple **external
circumferential lamellae** (Figure 8–1) and often some **inner circumferential lamellae**. Inner circumferential lamellae are located around the marrow cavity and
external circumferential lamellae are located immediately beneath the periosteum.

Each osteon is a long, often bifurcated cylinder generally parallel to the long axis of the diaphysis. It consists of a central canal surrounded by 4–10 concentric
lamellae. Each endosteum-lined canal contains blood vessels, nerves, and loose connective tissue. The central canals communicate with the marrow cavity and the
periosteum and with one another through transverse or oblique **perforating canals** (formerly known as Volkmann canals) (Figures 8–1 and 8–10). The transverse
canals do not have concentric lamellae; instead, they perforate the lamellae. All osteonic and perforating canals in bone tissue come into existence when matrix is laid
down around preexisting blood vessels.

**Lamellar bone: Perforating canals and interstitial lamellae.**

**(a):** Transverse perforating canals (P) connecting adjacent osteons are shown at the left side of the micrograph. Such canals "perforate" lamellae and provide another
source of microvasculature for the central canals of osteons. Among the intact osteons are also found remnants of eroded osteons, seen as irregular interstitial or
intermediate lamellae (I). X100. **(b):** Schematic diagram shows remodeling of compact lamellar bone showing three generations of osteonic haversian systems and their
successive contributions to the formation of interstitial lamellae. Remodeling is a continuous process that involves the coordinated activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts,
and is responsible for adaptation of bone to changes in stress, especially during the body's growth.

Among the osteons between the two circumferential systems are numerous irregularly shaped groups of parallel lamellae called **interstitial lamellae.** These
structures are lamellae remaining from osteons partially destroyed by osteoclasts during growth and remodeling of bone (Figure 8–10).

Bone **remodeling** is continuous throughout life and involves a combination of bone synthesis and removal. In compact bone, remodeling resorbs parts of old osteons
and produces new ones. Resorption involves the actions of osteoclasts, often working in groups to remove old bone in tunnel-like cavities having the approximate
diameter of new osteons. Such tunnels are quickly invaded by many osteoprogenitor cells and sprouting loops of blood capillaries, both derived from the endosteum
or periosteum. Osteoblasts develop, line the wall of the tunnels, and begin to secrete osteoid in a cyclic manner, forming concentric lamellae of bone with trapped
osteocytes (Figure 8–11). In healthy adults 5–10% of the bone turns over annually.

**Development of osteons.**

During remodeling of compact bone, a group of osteoclasts acts as a boring cone to make a tunnel into bone matrix. Behind these cells a population of osteoblasts enters
the tunnel and lines its walls. As the osteoblasts secrete osteoid in a cyclic manner, they produce layers of new matrix with cells trapped in lacunae. The cells in lacunae are
now osteocytes. The tunnel becomes constricted with multiple concentric layers of new matrix and its lumen finally exists as only a narrow central canal with small blood
vessels.

Variations in the remodeling activity produce great variability in the sizes of osteons, osteonic canals, and interstitial lamellae. As osteons form by successive
deposition of lamellae by osteoblasts, moving inward from the periphery, younger osteons usually have larger canals. In mature osteons the most recently formed
lamella is the one closest to the central canal.
