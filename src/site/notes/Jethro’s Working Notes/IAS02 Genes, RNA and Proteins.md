## Learning outcomes

To visualize transcription, splicing and translation mechanisms central to molecular biology

## The Central Dogma with some more colour

Central Dogma - Philosophy of molecular biology proposed by Francis Crick

While Crick proposed the one way nature of the Central Dogma, new findings added colour to the classical Central Dogma:

Reverse transcription (HIV), RNA replication in plants

## Visualising DNA

- DNA structure

    Protein-DNA binding mechanism:
    
    Proteins usually bind to to the major groove
    
- Research on structural differences relating to function of DNA and alpha helices

## Chargaff’s Rule

    Note:
    
    **Initiation**
    
    TATA-box binding protein is already binded to DNA at TATA box sequence, and is different from the mediator protein complex
    
    Mediator protein complex aka transcription factors
    
    Transcription factors manoeuvres RNA polymerase into place
    
    Same RNA polymerase is used for the transcription of different genes, while different transcription factors are used for different genes
    
    Think of transcription factors being the adaptor, and RNA polymerase as the general protein
    
    Transcription factors and RNA polymerase is known as the transcription initiation complex
    
    Initiation complex activated by activation proteins at enhancer region
    
    **Elongation**
    
    Elongation of mRNA occurs from 5' to 3', which is anti-parallel with the template strand
    

## Visualising RNA Splicing

    Note:
    
    Helper proteins bind to intron/ exon border, resulting in formation of spliceosome, which is used for removing introns
    
    Many diseases arise from problems relating splicing mechanism
    
    Other RNA processing processes include:
    
    5’ capping and adding Poly (A) tail at 3’
    
- Spinal Muscular atrophy as an inherited disease caused by splicing problems

## Visualising Translation

    2 subunits of Ribosome:
    
    Small subunit (40S) - binds to mRNA
    
    Large subunit (60S) - Contains proteins and RNA, catalysis mechanisms
    
    3 locations of Ribosome:
    
    A site - entry site, test for codon, anticodon match
    
    P site - where catalysis happens, adding amino acid to the growing peptide
    
    E site - exit site for wasted tRNA
    
    For proteins used outside the cell, translation occurs on rough ER, due to presence of transport mechanism
    
    Note that tRNA and mRNA are antiparallel during translation, think about that
