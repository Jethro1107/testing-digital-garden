### Trapezius

The trapezius muscle has a long line of origin, from the head, neck and the thoracic vertebrae. It inserts into a U shaped structure, where the upper fibres insert to the posterior surface of the lateral 1/3 of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clavicle\|Clavicle]], the middle fibres insert to the acromion and the inferior fibres insert at the spine of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Scapulae\|Scapulae]].

    The upper fibres of the trapezius elevate the scapulae.
    
    The middle fibres retract and adduct the scapulae.
    
    The lower fibres of the trapezius depress the scapulae.
