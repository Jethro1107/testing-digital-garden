### Oncogene and Tumour Suppressor Genes

- What are protooncogenes and oncogenes?
    
    Proto-oncogenes are normal cellular genes that are present in every cell of the body, and is carefully controlled as they are responsible for proliferation and differentiation
    
    Oncogenes are mutated alleles of proto-oncogenes in which their activities are hyperactive, allowing autonomous cell growth (gain-in-function)
    
    Oncogenes are dominant, as only 1-hit activation is required for tumorigenesis
    
- What are tumour suppressor genes?
    
    Tumour suppressor genes are genes that suppress growth
    
    Tumour suppressor genes are recessive genes and must be deleted or inactivated homozygously for tumorigenesis
    
    2-hit inactivation is required for the development of tumours
    
- What are the 5 different mechanisms of activation of oncogenes?
    1. Viral promotor insertion at 5' of oncogene causing aberrant activation of oncogene
    2. Viral enhancer insertion, which would increase promotor activity, and thus causing activation of oncogene
    3. Gene fusion - Active gene is connected to 5' end of oncogene, forming a hybrid gene, thus oncogene activity is controlled by active gene
    4. Point mutation
    5. Gene amplification
- What are the different mechanisms of inactivation of tumour suppressor genes?
    1. Deletion of part of the gene or the whole gene
    2. Truncating mutation (frameshift, nonsense or splice site mutation)
    3. Point mutation
    4. Promotor methylation (turning off promotor)
- Why is tumour development a multi-step process?
    
    Because it involves accumulation of mutations in oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes, genes that regulate cell death, and genes involved in DNA repair
    

### Carcinogens and Carcinogenic Factors

- How are carcinogenic factors classified?
    
    Hereditary factors - familial, ethnic
    
    Environmental factors - chemical, radiation, viruses
    
- How is age related to cancer types?
    
    Incidence of cancer increases with age, as more time is available to acquire the required mutations
    
    Most tumours in adults are carcinomas
    
    Most tumours in children are CNS, or of haematopoeitic origin
    
- How is sex related to common cancers in Hong Kong?

    All epithelial in origin (carcinoma)
    
- What are different types of chemical carcinogens?
    
    Initiating agents - electrophilic, mutagenic, causing rapid irreversible DNA alteration in isolated cells (responsible for initiation phase)
    
    Promoting agents - stimulates initiated cells to proliferate without altering the DNA (responsible for promoting phase)
    
- What are common properties of chemical carcinogens relating to carcinogenesis?
    
    Long latent period, requiring prolonged exposure
    
    Susceptibility varies among individuals
    
    Some require metabolic activation, but some can be destroyed by detoxification pathways (Heredity factors play a mild difference in activity of these pathways)
    
- What are examples of chemical carcinogens?
    
    Soot, alkylating agents, aromatic organic compounds, diet, asbestos, PVC monomers, arsenical compounds
    
- Describe the process in which a chemical carcinogen results in formation of a neoplastic cell. Illustrate with a diagram.

- How does radiation play a role in carcinogenesis?
    
    They act as mutagenic initiators, causing DNA damage
    
    If DNA is unrepaired and cell does not die by apoptosis, carcinogenesis is a possibility
    
- How does different forms of radiation have different carcinogenic effectiveness?
    
    Depends on linear energy transfer - Higher energy, more effective
    
- What types of cancer are caused by radiation?
    
    Leukemia, osteogenic sarcoma
    
- Give examples of oncogenic viruses and the corresponding human cancer caused.
    
    Human Papilloma Virus and Cervical cancer
    
    Epstein-barr virus and nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt lymphoma
    
    Hepatitis B virus and hepatocellular carcinoma
    
- What is the pathogenic mechanism of oncogenic virus?
    
    Still not fully known
    
    Viral DNA integration, clonal (present in all cancer cells)
    
    Expression of viral DNA produces viral oncoproteins that bind to and modify function of cellular proteins that modulate growth
    
    Additional genetic events is required for development into cancer, as carcinogenesis is a multi-step process
    
- Describe the mechanism of carcinogenesis by Hepatitis B virus.
    
    HBV carriers have increased risk of HCC
    
    Viral DNA integrates in host cells in clonal form
    
    Viral HBx protein activates host oncogenes and protein kinase C
    
    Associated with increased proliferation
    
    Additional genetic events required to develop into HCC
    
- What is hereditary neoplasia caused by?
    
    Inheritance of defective tumour suppressor gene
    
    Inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion
    
- Is there an ethnic association with cancer?
    
    Yes, as it may affect genetic or environmental factors
    
- What are other carcinogenic agents?
    
    Hormones (particularly sex hormones) - stimulate proliferation
    
    Chronic inflammation
    
    Immunodeficiencies - less effective in suppressing cancer development
    

### Hereditary Neoplasia

- What is hereditary neoplasia caused by?
    
    Inheritance of a defective tumour suppressive gene
    
    Commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion
    
- What are examples of Hereditary Neoplasia?
    
    Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, Lynch Syndrome (Mutated DNA mismatch repair genes), BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome
    
- What is the difference between oncogene and tumour suppressor gene in terms of their activation?
    
    Oncogene are dominant, in which it only require single activation to promote growth
    
    Tumour suppressor genes are recessive, requiring a 2 hit inactivation to allow unrestricted cell proliferation
    
- What is the difference in the development of normal sporadic cancer and the development of hereditary neoplasia?
    
    Normal sporadic cancer:
    
    Late onset, as 2-hit inactivation by mutation is required
    
    Single cancer in lifetime
    
    Hereditary neoplasia:
    
    Early onset, 1-hit inactivation of the remaining copy can result into cancer
    
    May develop multiple cancers in lifetime
    
    Inheritance in family
    
- What is Familial Adenomatous Polyposis?
    
    Familial Adenomatous Polyposis is an inherited disorder characterised by cancer of the colon
    
    It involves autosomal dominant inheritance of mutated Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene in chromosome 5
    
    When remaining copy of the APC gene is inactivated, it opens up gateway for excessive cell proliferation, resulting in adenomas
    
    Hence, an individual with FAP will have hundreds of adenomas carpeting the colon from the 2nd to 3rd decade of life
    
    Accumulation of further mutations leads to progression of an adenoma into an invasive carcinoma
    
- What is Lynch Syndrome?
    
    Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary Non-polyposis Colon Cancer Syndrome) is an inherited disorder characterised by cancer of the colon, endometrium and urinary tract
    
- Which gene is defective in Lynch Syndrome?
    
    Involves in autosomal dominant inheritance of a defective copy of MMR gene, a DNA mismatch repair gene
    
- What are the characteristic molecular changes in cancer developed form Lynch Syndrome gene carrier?
    
    It first involves the autosomal dominant inheritance of a defective copy of MMR gene
    
    When the remaining copy of MMR gene is inactivated by somatic mutation, cells fail to repair errors occurring during DNA replication
    
    There will be frequent replication errors in small DNA repeat sequences (microsatellites) due to defect in the DNA mispatch repair system
    
    Many coding regions of important growth regulatory proteins may contain microsatellites
    
    Mutations in microsatellites may cause frameshift and inability to synthesize to an intact protein
    
- Compare autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance of hereditary neoplasia.
    
    Autosomal dominant inheritance - Inheritance of 1 defective copy of the tumour suppressor gene is associated with very high risk of cancer (the phenotype) 
    
    e.g. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, BRCA1, BRCA2 associated breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch Syndrome
    
    Autosomal recessive inheritance - Inheritance of 2 defective copies, hence phenotype develops at birth
    
    Xeroderma pigmentosum - inheritance of both inactivated genes at birth results in inability to repair UV-induced DNA damage
