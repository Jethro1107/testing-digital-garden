### Cotrimoxazole

Cotrimoxazole is a combination of trimethoprim and sulmethoxazole in a 1:5 ratio. It is a bacteriostatic antifolate drug.

- **MOA of cotrimoxazole**
    
    Trimethoprim and sulmethoxazole are structually similar to intermediates of folate cycle, thus sequentially inhibiting the folate cycle.
    
    Sulmethoxazole is structurally similar to para-aminobezoic acid (PABA), thus competitively binds to dihydropteroate synthetase to inhibit conversion of PABA into dihydrofolic acid.
    
    Trimethroprim inhibits conversion of dihydrofolic acid into tetrahydrofolic acid by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductse.
    
    Inhibition of folate cycle inhibits DNA synthesis.
