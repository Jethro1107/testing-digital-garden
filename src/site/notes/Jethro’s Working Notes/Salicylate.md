### Salicylate
Salicylate is a class of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/NSAID\|NSAID]], that is associated with *Salicylate toxicity*.

- ********************************************Examples of Salicylate********************************************
    Aspirin - The prototype NSAID and salicylate, with a *********low cost********* and a ***********************long history of safety.***********************
    Diflunnisal - The ******************outlier salicylate******************, particularly in terms of the lack of salicylate toxicity.
- ****************************************************Clinical use of Salicylate****************************************************
    Aspirin:
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Aspirin is used as an anti-platelet drug\|Aspirin is used as an anti-platelet drug]].
    - Aspirin is used as an antipyretic drug and an analgesic, as these effects can be achieved at lower doses.
    - Aspirin is rarely used as an anti-inflammatory drug, as it requires higher doses and is associated with Salicylate toxicity.
    
    Diflunisal:
    - Diflunisal does not cross the blood brain barrier, and thus is not associated with Salicylate toxicity, but as a result lacks anti-pyretic effect.
    - Diflunisal is more COX-2 selective than aspirin, and is associated with less adverse effects of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/NSAID\|NSAID]].
    - Diflunixal has a more potent anti-inflammatory effect than aspirin, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory drug.
- **********************************Adverse effects of salicylate**********************************
    Other than the common [[adverse effects of traditional NSAIDs\|adverse effects of traditional NSAIDs]], Salicylate can also cross the blood brain barrier and cause ********************Salicylate Toxicity********************, especially when exceeding therapeutic doses********************:********************

- ************************************************Precaution of salicylate************************************************
    Salicylate is avoided in:
    - Children with fever due to influenza-like viral illness, due to association with ******************Reye’s Syndrome******************
    - Pre-existing conditions
        - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]]: Salicylate is not the NSAID of choice for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Management of gout\|Management of gout]]
        - Deminished cardiovascular functions
            Salicylate has a direct vasodilator effect and causes retention of Na+ and water.
            
            This increases cardiac workload, which can worsen congestive heart failure.
            
        - Hypothrombinemia and Vitamin K deficiency
    - Medication - By competing with OAT in the proximal convoluted tubules, resulting in reduced excretion of other drugs
        - Uricosuric agents ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Urate-lowering agents\|Urate-lowering agents]])
