### Viruses

- What are viruses?
    
    Viruses are aggregates of nucleic acid bounded by a protein coat, where some may be surrounded by a lipid envelope
    
- Describe the process of viral replication cycle?
    
    Viral attatchment
    
    Viral entry
    
    Viral uncoating
    
    Viral protein synthesis
    
    Viral nucleic acid replication
    
    Viral assembly
    
    Viral release
    
- How do some viruses persist in our body?
    
    Some are integrated into host DNA, making them difficult to eliminate (HIV)
    
    Some maintain episomal forms of their DNA in the nucleus (HSV)
    

### Classification of viruses

- How are viruses classified in virology?
    
    By nucleic acid - DNA vs RNA
    
    By number of strands of nucleic acid - ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA, dsRNA
    
    By presence of lipid envelope - enveloped vs non-enveloped
    
- How are viruses classified in clinical virology?
    
    By classification into different disease syndrome
    
    Disease syndromes:
    
    - Respiratory tract infection ([[CPR51  Pulmonary infections\|CPR51  Pulmonary infections]], [[CPR58  Upper respiratory tract infections\|CPR58  Upper respiratory tract infections]], [[CPR75  Lower respiratory tract infections I\|CPR75  Lower respiratory tract infections I]] ,[[CPR76  Lower respiratory tract infections II\|CPR76  Lower respiratory tract infections II]])
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Viral Hepatitis\|Viral Hepatitis]]
    - Gastroenteritis ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastrointestinal infections\|Gastrointestinal infections]])
    - Central nervous system infection
    - Myocarditis
    - Viral exanthems/ arboviruses

    Antigenic drift involves slight mutations every year such that seasonal influenza is annual
    
    Antigenic shift involves removal of some RNA segments or obtaining some RNA segments, causing pandemic influenza
    
    ---
    
    Antigenic drift - involves relatively minor mutations in HA or NA genes that occur frequently within an influenza subtype
    
    Drives seasonal epidemics, necessitating global year-round influenza surveillance and annual update of influenza virus
