## Inhibition of HCl Secretion

HCl secretion is inhibited when HCl is no longer needed for the activation of pepsinogen to pepsin (i.e., when chyme has moved to the small intestine). Logically, the major inhibitory control of HCl secretion is **decreased pH** of the gastric contents. The question arises, though: *Why does the pH of the gastric contents decrease when chyme moves to the small intestine?* The answer lies in the fact that food is itself a buffer for H + . With food in the stomach, as H + is secreted, much of it is buffered; the gastric contents are acidified, but not as much as they would be if there were no buffers. When the food moves to the small intestine, the buffering capacity is reduced, and further H + secretion reduces gastric pH to even lower values. This lower pH then inhibits gastrin secretion, which decreases H + secretion.

The major inhibitory mechanism for H + secretion by parietal cells involves **somatostatin.** Somatostatin, secreted by D cells of the stomach, inhibits gastric H + secretion through both a direct pathway and indirect pathways (see [Fig. 8.18](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0095) ). In the **direct pathway,** somatostatin binds to receptors on parietal cells that are coupled to adenylyl cyclase via a G i protein. When somatostatin binds to its receptor, G i is activated, adenylyl cyclase is inhibited, and cAMP levels are reduced; in this way, somatostatin antagonizes the stimulatory effect of histamine on H + secretion. In the **indirect pathways,** somatostatin inhibits both histamine release from ECL cells and gastrin release from G cells; the net result of these indirect actions is to reduce the stimulatory actions of histamine and gastrin. In similar fashion to somatostatin, **prostaglandins** (e.g., prostaglandin E 2 ) also antagonize histamine's stimulatory action on H + secretion by activating a G i protein and inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (see [Fig. 8.18](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0095) ).
