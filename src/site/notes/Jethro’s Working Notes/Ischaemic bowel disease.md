### Ischaemic bowel disease

There are two clinical entities in ischaemic bowel disease depending on the ischaemic segment: 1) Ischaemic enteritis (ischaemia of small bowel) 2) ischaemic colitis (ischaemia of the large bowel).

- **Pathogenesis of ischaemic bowel disease**
    
    Ischaemic bowel disease is caused by reduced perfusion relative to the metabolic demand of the intestine. There are four causes:
    
    Acute occlusion of arterial supply - Thrombosis, embolism, atherosclerotic plaques and vasculitis causes sudden occlusion of arterial supply. This results in ischemia and infarction.
    
    Bowel strangulation - Bowel strangulation seen commonly with hernias, sigmoidal volvulus comprimises mural arterial supply. This results in ischemia and gangrene.
    
    Generalised hypoperfusion - Generalised hypoperfusion due to shock results in decreased supply to entire GI tract. In cases of generalised hypoperfusion, bowel segments at ‘watershed zones’ are most susceptible to damage.
    
    Chronic ischemia - Chronic ischemia is often caused by stable atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in deminished blood supply over time. The mucosa of the ischemic bowel segment becomes fibrotic.
    
- **Clinical features of acute bowel ischemia**
    - Sudden onset of abdominal pain
    - Bloody diarrhoea
    - Shock
    - Metabolic acidosis on arterial blood gas
    - If perforation, there may be signs of peritonitis
- **Diagnosis of ischaemic bowel disease**
    
    CT scan with intravenous contrast can be performed.
    
    Laparoscopy or laparotomy is also done.
