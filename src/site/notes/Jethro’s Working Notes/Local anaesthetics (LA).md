### Local anaesthetics (LA)

Local anaesthetics is a class of drug that inhibits pain sensation.

- ******************************************Classification and examples of local anaesthetics******************************************
    
    LA can be classified by potency:
    
    - Low potency - Procaine, Chloroprocaine
    - Medium potency - Cocaine, Lignocaine (Lidocaine), Prilocaine, Mepivacaine
    - High potency - Tetracaine, Bupivacaine, Etidocaine
    
    LA can also be classified by chemical structure, into esters and amides:

- **************************************************MOA of local anaesthetics**************************************************
    
    Local anaesthetics diffuse across the plasma membrane and binds to voltage-gated Na+ channels intracellularly.
    
    This raises the threshold for voltage-gated Na+ channels to open, i.e raises the threshold for action potential generation.
    
    Hence, it prevents initiation, and subsequent propagation of action potentials in pain fibres, thus inhibiting pain sensation.
    

Other than the potency of LA, there other [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Factors affecting Local anaesthetic effects of LA\|Factors affecting Local anaesthetic effects of LA]].

- ****************************************Adverse effect of LA****************************************
    
    Systemic leak of LA (particularly with an increase in free drug fraction), can precipitate as LA toxicity: commonly with CNS and CVS disturbance.
    
    All excitable tissues are affected, and toxicity seems to be proportional to plasma drug levels and relative potency of the agent.

    - ********************************************Management of LA toxicity********************************************
        1. Stop LA
        2. Advanced cardiac life support when there is CVS disturbance
        3. Stop seizures - benzodiazepine
        4. Correct acidosis or hypercapnia, as these factors tend to potentiate LA toxicity.
        5. Intravenous lipid emulsion (lipid rescue)
