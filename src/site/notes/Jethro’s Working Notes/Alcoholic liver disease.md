### Alcoholic liver disease

    Alcoholic liver disease, or alcoholic fatty liver disease refers to fatty liver disease that is caused by excessive consumption of alcohol.
    
- **Clinical manifestations of alcoholic liver disease**
    
    Alcoholic liver disease can trigger a spectrum of hepatic changes, ranging from:
    
    - Hepatocellular steatosis (fatty liver)
    - Alcoholic hepatitis
    - Liver fibrosis and [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Cirrhosis\|Cirrhosis]]
    
    Steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis are reversible, whereas liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are irreversible.
