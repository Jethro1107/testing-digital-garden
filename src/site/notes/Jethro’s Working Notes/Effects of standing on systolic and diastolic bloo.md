Effects of standing on systolic blood pressure:

- Gravitational effects impairs venous return, thus decreasing preload, and stroke volume, decreasing cardiac output, thus decreasing systolic blood pressure

Effects of standing on diastolic blood pressure:

- The in response to a decrease in blood pressure, the baroreceptor reflex is stimulated, resulting in an increase in sympathetic stimulation.
- This results in vasoconstriction, resulting in vasoconstriction and an increase in diastolic blood pressure
