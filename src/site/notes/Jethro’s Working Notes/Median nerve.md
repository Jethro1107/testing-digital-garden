### Median nerve

The median nerve (C5-T1) is formed from the union of the lateral roots of the median nerve from the lateral cord, and the medial root of the median nerve from the median cord.

- ********************In the arm********************
    
    The median nerve courses medial to the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biceps brachii\|Biceps brachii]] of the anterior compartment of the arm, and is largely associated with the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial artery\|Brachial artery]]. 
    
    It crosses the brachial artery from the lateral to the medial side and continues like this into the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cubital fossa\|Cubital fossa]].
    
    Despite its course along the arm, the median nerve does not provide innervation to the arm.
    
- ****************************In the forearm****************************
    
    It then leaves the cubital fossa, through the two layers of the pronator teres muscle, where it travels between the intermediate and deep layer of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anterior compartment of the forearm\|Anterior compartment of the forearm]].
    
    Branches of the median nerve provide:
    
    - Motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm, except for the flexor carpi ulnaris, and the medial part of the flexor digitorum profundus.

    Distally in the forearm, it lies deep to the palmaris longus, where it gives off:
    
    - Sensory innervation to the palmar surface of the lateral 3 and a half digits and the associated palmar surfaces of the hand, as well as the dorsal surface of the distal phalanges of the lateral 3 and a half digits, ************via the palmar cutaneous branch************, which is a branch of the median nerve ********************************************************************************before it passes into the cubital fossa.********************************************************************************

    The median nerve passes into the carpal tunnel, where it sits anterior to the tendons.
    
    This provides motor innervation of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Thenar muscles\|Thenar muscles]]  (except the abductor pollicus brevis), 1st and 2nd [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Lumbricals\|Lumbricals]].
