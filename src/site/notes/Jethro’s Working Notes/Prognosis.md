### Prognosis

Prognosis refers to the most likely course and outcome of the disease over time.

There are two types of prognosis:

- Clinical course - Prognosis of a disease with medical care
- Natural history - Prognosis of a disease without medical intervention

### Studies regarding prognosis

*It is difficult to study prognosis.* Clinical course is difficult to study as medical care changes with time, which changes prognosis. Natural history is unethical to study, as it involves witholding treatment.

- **When studying prognosis, there should be 3 questions in mind**
    
    Average/ overall prognosis
    
    Prognostic factors
    
    Risk prediction models
    
- ******************The gold standard for studies of prognosis******************
    
    Cohort studies are the gold standard for studying prognosis.
    
    They give us the best information regarding prognosis and prognostic factors.

- ********************************************************Outcome of prognosis studies********************************************************
    
    Mortality is outcome studied in prognosis studies, which can be acquired from death certificates.
    
    - All cause mortality and disease specific mortality can be used, but disease specific mortality is prone to misclassification.
- ********************************************************Comparing outcomes with or without exposure uses:********************************************************
    
    Standardised mortality ratio (Observed death vs Expected death), where expected number of death is acquired from mortality rate of age (and gender) specific data.
    
    Case fatality rate:

    - Case fatality rate is largely dependent on the period of time. When too short, it would greatly under-estimate case fatality rate. The longer the follow up, the better the data collected.
