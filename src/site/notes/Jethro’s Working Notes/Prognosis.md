### Prognosis

Prognosis refers to the most likely course and outcome of the disease over time.

There are two types of prognosis:

- Clinical course - Prognosis of a disease with medical care
- Natural history - Prognosis of a disease without medical intervention

### Studies regarding prognosis

*It is difficult to study prognosis.* Clinical course is difficult to study as medical care changes with time, which changes prognosis. Natural history is unethical to study, as it involves witholding treatment.

- **When studying prognosis, there should be 3 questions in mind**
    
    Average/ overall prognosis
    
    Prognostic factors
    
    Risk prediction models
    
- ******************The gold standard for studies of prognosis******************
    
    Cohort studies are the gold standard for studying prognosis.
    
    They give us the best information regarding prognosis and prognostic factors.

    Mortality is outcome studied in prognosis studies, which can be acquired from death certificates.
    
    - All cause mortality and disease specific mortality can be used, but disease specific mortality is prone to misclassification.
- ********************************************************Comparing outcomes with or without exposure uses:********************************************************
    
    Standardised mortality ratio (Observed death vs Expected death), where expected number of death is acquired from mortality rate of age (and gender) specific data.
    
    Case fatality rate:

    - Case fatality rate is largely dependent on the period of time. When too short, it would greatly under-estimate case fatality rate. The longer the follow up, the better the data collected.
