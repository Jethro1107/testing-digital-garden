### Intestinal brush border enzymes (small intestinal disaccharides) are involved in the digestion of disaccharides into monosaccharides

Intestinal brushborder enzymes (small intestinal disaccharides) breaks down dietary dissachirides such as sucrose and lactose, and digestive products of starch (maltose, isomaltose and maltotriose) into monosaccharides.

- **These intestinal brush border enzymes include:**
    
    Maltase - cleaves alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds between in maltose and maltotriose
    
    Isomaltase - cleaves alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds in isomaltose and alpha-dextrin
    
    Sucrase - cleaves alpha-1,2 glycosidic bonds in sucrose
    
    Lactase - cleaves beta-1,4 glycosidic bonds in lactose
