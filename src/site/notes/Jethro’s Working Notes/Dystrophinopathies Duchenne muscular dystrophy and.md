### Dystrophinopathies: Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy

- ********************************************What is dystrophinopathy?********************************************
    
    Dystrophinopathies is an X-linked recessive disorder (a common [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Muscular dystrophy\|Muscular dystrophy]]) that involve mutation of the dystrophin gene, resulting in abnormal function of dystrophin.
    
    There are 2 clinical entities classified by the clinical course and genotype:
    
    1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy
    2. Becker muscular dystrophy
- **********************************************************************Epidemiology of DMD**********************************************************************
    
    DMD has an incidence of 1:3500 male births.
    
- ******************************************Inheritance of DMD******************************************
    
    DMD is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion.
    
    It only affects males, as men with DMD are unlikely to father children.
    
- ********************************************Natural history of DMD and BMD********************************************
    
    Natural history of Duchene muscular dystrophy:
    
    DMD has a relatively early onset, and proceeds in an invariably fatal course.
    
    At birth, infant boys with DMD shows no physical indications.
    
    By 18 months to 4 years old, the symptoms becomes evident, with clumsiness and the inability to keep up with peers due to muscle weakness.
    
    Muscle weakness progress rapidly:
    
    - Initially, it is at the pelvic girdle and the pectorial girdle, followed by muscles of the upper limbs and trunk, and eventually involving all other muscles.
    
    By 12 years old, they tend to lose the ability to walk independently.
    
    **********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************By 15-25 years old, death tend to result from respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia and cardiac decompensation.**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
    
    Natural history of Becker muscular dystrophy:
    
    BMD has a relatively later onset at childhood or adolescence, where usually muscle weakness is evident beyond the age of 7.
    
    Muscle weakness progresses slower than in DMD, but at variable rates: BMD patients may lose their ability to walk from 16-80 years old.
    
    A characteristic of BMD is calf hypertrophy, or pseudohypertrophy, initially due to muscle fibre hypertrophy, but then is caused by fatty replacement and endomysial fibrosis.
    
- ******************************************************Pathogenesis of DMD and BMD******************************************************
    
    Both forms of dystrophinopathies are caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene located on the p arm of the X chromosome (Xp21).
    
    - Base deletions, frameshift mutations tend to cause DMD
    - Point mutations tend to cause BMD
    
    Dystrophin is an large intracellular protein that at one end connects to actin filaments, while the other end connects with membrane glycoprotein complexes to interact with the extracellular matrix.

    It stabilizes muscle fibres during contraction, preventing transient tears in the sarcolemma.
    
    Insufficient dystrophin, or abnormal function of dystrophin, results in muscle fibre degeneration that outpaces the repair, resulting in progressive muscle weakness.
    
- **********************************************************************************Histological manifestation of DMD and BMD**********************************************************************************
    
    The hallmarks of DMD and BMD are the muscle fibre degeneration, outpacing repair, with progressive replacement of muscle tissues with fats and endomysial degeneration to be the result of it.
    
    On muscle biopsy with H&E staining:
    
    - Marked variation of muscle fibre size, due to the regeneration.
    - Increase in space betwen muscle fibres, as a result of fatty replacement and endomysial fibrosis.

- ******Investigations of DMD******
    
    Blood tests - There is elevation of creatine kinase levels (10 to 100 times of normal amounts).
    
    Electromyography may indicate muscle weakness.
    
- ******************************************************Definitive diagnosis of DMD******************************************************
    
    Immunostaining of muscle biopsy reveals abundance of dystrophin.
