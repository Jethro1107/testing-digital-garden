### Fates of dietary cholesterol

- **2 forms of dietary cholesterol and their properties**
    
    Free cholesterol (FE):
    
    Hydrophobic
    
    Consist of 4 fused hydrocarbon rings called the ‘steroid nucleus’ and a hydrocarbon tail
    
    Cholesteryl ester (CE):
    
    More hydrophobic than free cholesterol
    
    Esterified with fatty acid at steroid nucleus

- Fates of dietary cholesterol
    - **Proportion of cholesterol forms in dietary cholesterol**
        
        Dietary source of cholesterol consist of:
        
        85-90% free cholesterol (FC)
        
        10-15% cholesteryl ester (CE)
        
    - **Digestion and absorption of cholesterol**
        
        Cholesteryl ester is hydrolyzed by cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH) to form free cholesterol for absorption
        
        In enterocytes, free cholesterol is converted back to cholesteryl ester
        
        Cholesteryl ester is shuttled with ApoB48, phospholipids and TAG to form nascent chylomicrons
        
        Nascent chylomicrons are released into lymphatic system by exocytosis
        
    - **Transport of dietary cholesterol**
        
        Chylomicrons enter blood stream and deliver TAG to peripheral tissues, before reaching the liver
        
        ApoE receptor mediated endocytosis of chylomicron remnants in the liver enables release of cholesterol into the liver

    - **Function of liver in cholesterol metabolism**
        1. Uptake and release of cholesterol
        2. De nevo synthesis of cholesterol
        3. Conversion of cholesterol into functional metabolites
        4. Conversion of cholesterol into bile salt
    - **Effects of age on cholesterol absorption**
        
        When age increase, cholesterol absorption increase
        
    - **Effects of reduced bile acid excretion on lipoprotein metabolism**
        
        Reduced bile acid excretion results in decreased demand of cholesterol in the liver
        
        This results in decreased expression of LDL receptors, resulting in prolonged LDL clearance
        
        This results in elevated LDL
        
- Release and return of cholesterol by liver
    - **Release of cholesterol by liver**
        
        Cholesteryl ester and TAG in liver are packaged into VLDL and released by exocytosis, which mature by the transfer of ApoCII and ApoE from HDL
        
        In peripheral tissues, LPL hydrolyze TAG in VLDL, releasing fatty acids to peripheral tissues
        
        As most of TAG in VLDL is hydrolyzed by LPL, it decreases in size and increases in density, as it remodels into IDL and LDL
        
        LDL is responsible for delivery of cholestrol to peripheral tissues via specific receptors
        
        In the liver, ApoB100 activate LDL receptor to trigger LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL, returning remaining cholesterol to hepatocytes
        
    - **Return of cholesterol by liver**
        
        Known as reverse cholesterol transport
        
        HDL collects free cholesterol from peripheral tissues released by ABCA1 of cells by converting free cholesterol into cholesteryl ester by LCAT (lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase) reaction

### De novo cholesterol synthesis and regulation by bile acid

- De novo cholesterol synthesis
    - **Site of de novo cholesterol synthesis**
        
        In cytosol of all tissues, particularly in the liver
        
    - **Main steps involved in de novo cholesterol synthesis**
        1. Conversion of acetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA
        2. Reduction of HMG-CoA into mevalonic acid
        3. Conversion of mevalonic acid into cholesterol
    - **Rate limiting enzyme in regulating de novo cholesterol synthesis**
        
        HMG-CoA reductase is the rate limiting enzyme, responsible for reduction of HMG-CoA into mevalonic acid 
        
    - **Regulation of rate limiting enzyme of de novo cholesterol synthesis**
        1. By negative feedback mechanism
            
            High intracellular cholesterol concentration inhibits transcription of HMG-CoA reductase gene and increases proteolytic degradation of HMG-CoA reductase
            
        2. By hormone influence
            
            Insulin and thyroxin favours expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene
            
            Glucagon and glucocorticoids inhibits expression of the gene
            
    - **Substrates required for de novo cholesterol synthesis**
        
        ATP, NADPH, Acetate as source of C atoms
        
- Bile acid and cholesterol balance
    - Synthesis of bile acids
        - **Common chemical structure of bile acids**
            
            24C with 2-3 OH groups, and a COOH group in the side chain, derived from cholesterol
            
        - **Synthesis of primary bile acids**
            
            Primary bile acids is derived from cholesterol through hydroxylation, cleavage and oxidation of side chain
            
            Cholic acid - series of bile salt with 3 OH groups
            
            Chenodeoxycholic acid - series of bile salt with 2 OH groups

        - **Properties of primary bile acids**
            
            Primary bile salt has a hydrophobic side and hydrophilic side, making them amphipathic in nature
            
            pKa of primary bile acid is 6, which is the pH of the small intestine, such that 50% of bile acid is ionized to enhance its emulsifying properties

        - **Conjugation of bile acids**
            
            Conjugation of amino acids to COOH group of side chain
            
            Conjugation with:
            
            Taurine (a produce of cysteine)
            
            Glyceine
            
            Glyceine conjugation gives glycocholic acid or glycochenodeoxycholic acid
            
            Taurine conjugation gives taurocholic acid or taurochenodeoxycholic acid

            Ref: [[Marks’ Biochemistry  Conjugation of bile salt\|Marks’ Biochemistry  Conjugation of bile salt]] 
            
        - **Properties of conjugated bile acids**
            
            pKa of conjugated bile acid is much lower, such that most of the bile acid in small intestine is ionised, thus enhancing their amphipathic nature
            
        - **Effects of gut flora on bile salt**
            1. Conjugated bile acids may become deconjugated
            2. Primary bile acids may become dehydroxylated at C7 into secondary bile acid
                
                Cholic acid → Deoxycholic acid
                
                Chenodeoxycholic acid → Lithocholic acid

    - **Fate of bile acids**
        - Enterohepatic circulation
            
            95% of bile acids are reabsorbed, and complexes with albumin and travel via enterohepatic circulation (portal vein) back to the liver
            
            In the liver, deconjucated bile salts will get reconjugated
            
        - Excretion
            
            5% of bile acid is not reabsorbed into enterohepatic circulation and is excreted in faeces
            
            The loss of bile acid is replaced by new bile acid produced from cholesterol
            

### The good and bad of cholesterol

- The good
    - **Functions of cholesterol**
        
        Synthesis of functional molecules - Bile acids, Vitamin D3, Steroids (Minerocorticoids, glucocorticoids, androgens)
        
        Maintain cell membrane
        
    - Reverse cholesterol transport
        - **Function of reverse cholesterol transport**
            
            HDL removes cholesterol in cholesterol-laden cells and returns the cholesterol to the liver
            
        - **Mechanism of reverse cholesterol transport**
            
            Nascent HDL is released by hepatic and intestinal cells
            
            Efflux of free cholesterol from peripheral cells via ABCA1, uptake by HDL by converting free cholesterol into cholesteryl ester through LCAT reaction
            
            HDL transfer cholesterol back to liver via SRB1 (scavenger receptor class B type 1)

- The bad
    - Disease associated with cholesterol
        
        Atherosclerosis
        
        - **Why does LDL penetrate the endothelial layer?**
            
            Small in size
            
            Positively-charged amino acids such as lysine and arginine on ApoB is attracted to negatively charged sulphates in proteoglycans
            
        - **How is phagocytosis of oxLDL mediated by receptors on macrophages?**
            
            Mediated by 2 receptors: Scavenger receptor and ApoB receptor
            
            Recognition of oxLDL mediated by the two receptors results in phagocytosis of oxLDL, resulting in foam cell formation
            
            Scavenger receptor is not regulated by intracellular cholesterol levels, enabling massive uptake of lipids by macrophage to form foam cells
