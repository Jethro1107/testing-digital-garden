### Epidemiology and risk factors of osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis is the most common disease of the joint.

OA of the hip is less prevelant in Hong Kong (and in Chinese population) relative to western countries, whereas OA of the knee is more prevelant in Hong Kong (and in Chinese population) relative to western countries. This may be explained by the relatively common varus malalignment in this locality.

- **Risk factors predisposing to osteoarthritis**
    
    Systemic factors like age, sex, ethnicity, hormonal status, bone density and nutritional and metabolic factors.
    
    Local mechanical factors such as joint deformities and malalignment ([[Genu valgum and genu varum predispose to osteoarthritis of the knee\|Genu valgum and genu varum predispose to osteoarthritis of the knee]]), obesity, joint injury, occupational factors, sports and muscle weakness.
    
    However, as many risk factors there are, age is possibly the biggest risk factor of them all.
