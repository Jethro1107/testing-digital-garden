### Innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall

The parietal peritoneum, muscles and the skin is innervated by the *T5-T11 spinal nerve, subcostal nerve (T12) and branches of L1 spinal nerve, iliohypogastric nerve and ilio-inguinal nerve.*

The anterior rami of the spinal nerves proceed from posterior to anterior, in an inferomedial direction. As they proceed, it gives off a lateral continuous branch and ends as an anterior cutaneous branch.

T5-T11 intercostal nerves leave their intercostal spaces, and continues into the anterolateral abdominal wall between the internal obliques and transversus abdominis, where it gives off a lateral cutaneous branch and continues. As it proceeds towards the lateral edge of the rectus sheath, it passes the rectus sheath and is posterior to the lateral aspect of rectus abdominis muscle. Approaching the midline, it gives off the anterior cutaneous branch that passes through the rectus abdominis muscle and the anterior layer of rectus sheath to supply the skin. T12 and L1 spinal nerves also follow a similar pathway.
