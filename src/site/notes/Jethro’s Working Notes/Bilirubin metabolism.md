### Bilirubin metabolism

*Erythrocyte clearance occurs in all structures with sinusoidal capillaries (liver, spleen, bone marrow), but mainly in the spleen.* Damaged or old erythrocytes are phagocytosed by macrophages (Kupffer cells, splenic macrophages).

The main component of Red Blood Cells (RBC), haemoglobin is broken down into heme and globin. Heme is further broken down into **bilivirdin** and Fe2+ under the action of *Heme oxidase*. Bilivirdin is further broken down into **bilirubin** by *bilivirdin reductase*.

Bilirubin is released into circulation as **unconjugated bilirubin (indirect bilirubin)**, which complexes with albumin as it is relatively insoluble in water. The complex is carried via the splenic vein and the portal vein into the liver. In the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatic sinusoids\|Hepatic sinusoids]] and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Space of Disse\|Space of Disse]], unconjugated bilirubin is taken up into the hepatocytes via basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane *bilirubin transporter*.

*Conjugated bilirubin is formed in the hepatocytes, and excreted with bile.* Unconjugated bilirubin enters smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and conjugates with glucuronic acid, to form **conjugated bilirubin (direct bilirubin)**. This is mediated by UDP-glucorunosyltransferase (UGT), a phase 2 enzyme in drug metabolism ([[Mediated by UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)\|Mediated by UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)]]). Conjugated bilirubin is then released into [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Bile cannaliculus\|Bile cannaliculus]] via apical (cannalicular) membrane MRP-2 (multidrug-resistant associated peptide Type 2). It becomes a component of hepatic bile, and drained into the gallbladder for storage.

Eventually, when eating, conjugated bilirubin is released into the gut. It first becomes unconjugated by gut bicrobiota. Further processed by enzymes of gut microbiota, it is converted into urobilinogen.

- Much of the urobilinogen is converted into stercobilinogen, and into stercobilin. *Stercobilin gives faeces its brown colour.*
- A small portion of urobilinogen is absorbed into circulation (Enterohepatic circulation), where most is re-excreted into bile.
- Urobilinogen may enter systemic circulation and excreted by renal mechanisms. It is metabolised into urobillin. *Urobillin gives urine its yellow colour.*
