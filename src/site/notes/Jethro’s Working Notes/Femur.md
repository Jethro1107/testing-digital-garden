### Femur
The femur forms the bony framework of the thigh.
- **Classification of the femur**
    The femur is classified as a long bone. In fact, it is the longest and heaviest bone of the body.
- **Proximal end of the femur**
    The proximal end of the femur forms the femur head, which is shaped as 2/3 of a sphere.
    
    Immediately distal to the femur head, is the neck, which is a cylindrical strut that separates the head and the shaft of the femur.
    
    The proximal end of the shaft of the femur is marked by two bony landmarks, the greater and lesser trochanter:
    - The greater trochanter projects anterolaterally, while the lesser trochanter (smaller) projects posteromedially.
    - Anteriorly, the greater and lesser trochanter are connected by a bony ridge called the intertrochanteric line.
    - Posteriorly, the greater and lesser trochanter are connected by a bony ridge called the intertrochanteric crest, which is marked by the quadrate tubercle.
    
    On the posterior surface, the gluteal tuberosity is present, and continues with the linea asperas on the shaft of the femur.

- **Shaft of the femur**
    The anterior surface of the shaft of the femur is smooth. The posterior surface is rough:
    
    It is marked by the linea asperas, an elevated crest that serves as the posterior border of the shaft of the femur.
    
    The linea asperas expands distally to give the lateral and medial supracondylar line, terminating at the lateral epicondyle and the adductor tubercle respectively.

- **Distal end of the femur**
    The distal end of the femur separates into two condyles, the lateral condyle and the medial condyle, which provides the articular surfaces in the knee joint.
    - The anterior surface serves as the patellar surface.
    
    Laterally, the two epicondyles, lateral epicondyle and medial condyle serve as non-articular surfaces of the two condyles.
    
    Posteriorly, between the two condyles, the intercondylar fossa is found, which consists of the facets for the attachment of the cruciate ligaments in the knee joint.

- **Angles of the femur**
    Two angles of the femur enables normal gait:
    
    - The angle of inclination of the neck (angle between the long axis of the neck and shaft, normally at 125 degrees) - Coxa valga (when the angle is too large) and Coxa vara (when the angle is too small).
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - Angle of femur torsion or anteversion (angle between the shaft and the condyles, normally at 12 degrees) - This enables femur to run obliquely.
