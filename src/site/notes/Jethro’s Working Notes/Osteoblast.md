### Osteoblast

Osteoblasts are cells derived from osteoprogenitor cells in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Periosteum and endosteum\|Periosteum and endosteum]], that are involved in synthesis of organic matrix (osteoid), and the subsequent mineralization of the osteoid ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Biomineralization of bone\|Biomineralization of bone]]).

Hence, they assume a protein-synthesizing phenotype, with prominent Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum, hence, a basophilic cytoplasm.

- ******************************************************************Location of osteoblasts******************************************************************
    
    Osteoblasts sit on the bone surface, side by side, somewhat ressembling a simple epithelium, laying down osteoid, enabling oppositional growth. They are eventually surrounded by the osteoid they synthesize, and become [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteocyte\|Osteocyte]].

- **********************************Osteoblastic activity determines morphology and biochemical properties**********************************
    
    When osteoblasts are actively laying down organic matrix, they are cuboidal or columnar in shape, and have an basophilic cytoplasm.
    
    - They also have high alkaline phosphatase activity.
    
    When osteoblasts are inactive, they flatten.
    
    - They have low alkaline phosphatase activity.
    - 3 months of inactivity will cause them to turn into ******************bone lining cells.******************
