# Sources of Amino Acids

- Learning Outcomes
    
    Discover the sources of amino acids from diet and from protein turnover
    
- Exogenous Source of Amino Acids
    
    Digestion of dietary protein constitutes the exogenous supply of amino acids
    
    - Digestion
        - What occurs in the stomach?
            
            Gastric chief cells release pepsinogen, a zymogen (inactive)
            
            Release of acid lowers pH, which results the self-cleaving process of pepsinogen to pepsin (active)
            
            Pepsin breaks down proteins into peptides
            
        - What occurs in the intestine?
            
            Pancreas release a list of zymogens - Trypsinogen, Chymotrypsinogen, Proelastase, Procarboxypeptidases
            
            Trypsinogen is cleaved by enteropeptidase to give trypsin, which cleaves the other zymogens
            
            The zymogens when activated (trypsin, chymotrypin, elastase, carboxypeptidases) are collectively known as endopeptidases
            
            Endopeptidase cleave peptides into amino acids for absorption
            
        - What occurs in the enterocytes?
            
            Exopeptidase found in enterocytes cleave dipeptides and tripeptides absorbed into enterocytes into amino acids
            
    - Absorption Process
        
        Enterocytes take up amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides, but only amino acids can pass through the serosal side of enterocytes into the blood circulation, thus the need of exopeptidase to cleave the small peptides
        
        Sodium ion-dependent carrier transports amino acid with Na+ in the intestinal lumen into the enterocytes
        
        Sodium ion absorbed into enterocytes is pumped out in exchange for K+ using a Sodium-Potassium ATPase pump to maintain the Na+ gradient to power the sodium ion-dependent carrier
        
        Amino acid is transported out the enterocytes into the blood circulation via faccilitated transporters
        
        Peptides may enter blood circulation via the gaps between cells of the intestinal lining or via pinocytosis
        
- Endogenous Source of Amino Acids
    
    Protein turnover - protein half-life ranges from minutes to days, very short
    
    Protein degradation can be carried out in two ways: ubiquitin-protosome system and lysosome

# Amino Acid Metabolism

- Learning Outcomes
    
    Explain the fates of nitrogen and carbon skeleton of amino acids
    
- Amino Acid Metabolism
    - What is transamination and deamination?
        
        Transamination - An amino acid transfers its amino group to an alpha-keto acid
        
        Deamination - An amino loses its amino group as NH3 or NH4+
        
    - What is the fate of the alpha-keto acid (Fate of C skeleton)?
        
        Alpha-keto acids enter the TCA cycle at its appropriate points
        
        This allows our liver to make use of proteins as an energy source when body is short of glycogen
        
        By this logic, Alpha-keto acids can also exit the TCA cycle to synthesise amino acids
        
    - What is the fate of nitrogen of amino acid?
        
        NH3/NH4+ is toxic, hyperammonemia is a neurotoxic condition to the brain and CNS
        
        Urea cycle is used to maintain N balance in the body
        
        Urea cycle takes place in hepatocytes, converting toxic NH3 into urea, a non-toxic carrier of nitrogen
        
        For urea formation, one nitrogen is from ammonia, and the other is from aspartate
        

# Ammonia Transportation

- Learning Outcomes
    
    Describe ammonia transportation by alanine and glutamine
    
- Glucose-Alanine cycle
    - What is the glucose-alanine cycle?
        
        Glucose-Alanine cycle is the process in which amino group and carbon is transported from peripheral cells and muscle to the liver for urea biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis respectively
        
        This occurs during starvation or during exercise
        
        - Describe how the amino group is transferred to pyruvate to give alanine
            
            Amino acids transfer amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate to give glutamate, which transfers the amino group to pyruvate to give alanine in the presence of alanine aminotransferase
            
        - Describe the conversion of alanine to glucose and urea in hepatocytes. Draw a diagram.
            
            Alanine transfers amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate to give glutamate, pyruvate is liberated
            
            Gluconeogenesis: Pyruvate formed is converted to glucose
            
            Urea formation:
            
            Involves the glutamate formed
            
            Glutamate may be deaminated to release NH4+
            
            Glutamate may also transfer its amino group to oxaloacetate to give aspartate
            
            Aspartate and NH4+ is fed into Urea cycle for urea biosynthesis

- Glutamine as an Ammonia Transport
    - Describe how glutamine synthesis is integrated into the urea cycle
        
        In muscles, two amino groups may be transferred to alpha-ketoglutarate to give glutamine
        
        Glutamate travels via blood to the liver
        
        In the liver, glutamate releases 2 NH4+ for urea biosynthesis
