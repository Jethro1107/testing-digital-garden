### Patella

The patella is the bone that forms the ‘knee cap’. Classified as a sesamoid bone, it is actually the largest sesamoid bone of the body.

It is a triangular bone with the apex pointing inferiorly. The posterior surface if the patella is lined with hyaline cartilage, and is separated into the larger lateral articular facet and the smaller medial articular facet, which articulates to the corresponding condyles of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Femur\|Femur]] at the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Knee joint\|Knee joint]].

- **The patella, similar to other sesamoid bones is enclosed within a tendon**
    
    Superiorly, it attaches to the quadriceps tendon, whereas inferiorly it attaches to the ligamentum patellae. The quadriceps tendon is actually continuous with the ligamentum patellae, which inserts at the tibial tuberosity of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Tibia\|Tibia]], i.e. *The patellae is enclosed within the quadriceps tendon.*
