### Defining Neoplasia

- Define Neoplasia.
    
    Neoplasia means "new growth", and a new growth is a neoplasm.
    
    > Neoplasm is defined as an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues and persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli which evoked the change.
    > 
- What are the phenotypes of a neoplasm?
    
    Loss of response to normal growth control mechanism, causing continued proliferation even without a recognizable stimulus
    
    Loss of differentiation or Aberrant differentiation function
    
    Expression of of 'embryonal' characteristics
    
- What is the difference between neoplasia and hyperplasia/hypertrophy?
    
    Neoplasia is uncoordinated and irreversible, while hyperplasia/hypertrophy is coordinated and reversible
    

### Neoplasm: Benign vs Malignant

- What are the two major ways a malignant neoplasm differs from a benign neoplasm?
    
    Malignant neoplasm has the ability for invasion and the ability for metastasis while benign neoplasm doesn't
    
- Compare the mode of growth between a benign neoplasm and a malignant neoplasm.
    
    Benign neoplasm: Expansive, but limited by basal membrane
    
    Malignant neoplasm: Expansive and infiltrative, causing invasion beyond the basement membrane into the connective tissue
    
- Compare the gross appearance between a benign neoplasm and a malignant neoplasm.
    
    Benign neoplasm: Circumscribed and encapsulated, Clear margins
    
    Malignant neoplasm: Poorly defined margins
    
- Compare the rate of growth between a benign neoplasm and a malignant neoplasm.
    
    Benign neoplasm: Slow and may cease, i.e. grow for a period of time and stop growing, remaining as a mass
    
    Malignant neoplasm: Rapid, commonly outgrowing blood supply, causing irregular necrosis
    
- Compare the microscopic appearance between a benign neoplasm and a malignant neoplasm.
    
    
    | Characteristics | Benign | Malignant |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Differentiation/anaplasia | Well differentiated; structure sometimes typical of tissue of origin | Some lack of differentiation (anaplasia); structure often atypical |
    | Rate of growth | Usually progressive and slow; may come to a standstill or regress; mitotic figures rare and normal | Erratic, may be slow to rapid; mitotic figures may be numerous and abnormal |
    | Local invasion | Usually cohesive, expansile, well-demarcated masses that do not invade or infiltrate surrounding normal tissues | Locally invasive, infiltrating surrounding tissue; sometimes may be misleadingly cohesive and expansile |
    | Metastasis | Absent | Frequent; more likely with large undifferentiated primary tumors |
    
    Benign neoplasm is well-differentiated (closely resemble the tissue of origin), while Malignant neoplasm have varying degree of differentiation (some lack of differentiation, i.e. anaplastic).
    
    Benign neoplasm have low N:C ratio while Malignant neoplasm have high N:C ratio.
    
    Benign neoplasm have regular cellular and nuclear shape and size, while Malignant neoplasm show cellular and nuclear pleomorphism (variations in the size and shape of the cell and nucleus).
    
    Benign neoplasm have normochromatic nuclei while Malignant neoplasm have hyperchromatic nuclei (dark and clumped).
    
    Benign neoplasm have absent or scanty mitosis, while Malignant neoplasm have increased mitosis and presence of abnormal mitosis.
    
    Benign neoplasm have mild architectural disturbance with maintained polarity, while Malignant neoplasm have loss of polarity with marked architectural disturbance.
    
- Compare the architectural change and polarity of cells between a benign neoplasm and a malignant neoplasm.
    
    Architecture and polarity is preserved in a benign neoplasm
    
    Visible loss of polarity and marked architectural disturbance in a malignant neoplasm

### Differentiation of Neoplasm

- What is the differentiation of the neoplasm?
    
    The Differentiation of the neoplasm refers to the degree of resemblance of the neoplasm to its tissue of origin both morphologically and functionally
    

### Nomenclature of Neoplasm

- Briefly explain the nomenclature of neoplasms.

### Dysplasia

- What is the relationship between a benign and malignant tumour?
    
    Most benign tumours remain benign and never progress to malignant tumour
    
    Malignant tumour may arise de nevo without a recognisable benign phase
    
    Most malignant tumour may develop from a benign tumour through progressive malignant transformation
    
- What is dysplasia?
    
    Dysplasia refers to cellular changes similar to malignant cells but there is no evidence of invasion and no actual tumour mass formation. Dysplasia can be graded as mild, moderate or severe.
    
    Dysplasia is encountered principally in the epithelium
    
    If dysplastic change involves the whole epithelium, it is called carcinoma-in-situ
    
    Dysplasia increases the risk of developing carcinoma
    
    Cf: [[ Dysplasia  is a term that literally means “disordered growth.” It is encountered principally in epithelial cells and is recognized on the basis of several morphologic changes. Dysplastic cells may exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often contain large hyperchromatic nuclei with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Dysplastic epithelial surfaces also typically show architectural disarray and a loss of orderly differentiation. For example, in dysplastic squamous epithelium the normal progressive maturation of tall cells in the basal layer to flattened squames on the surface may fail in part or entirely, leading to replacement of the epithelium by basal-like cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. In addition, mitotic figures are more abundant than in the normal squamous epithelium and may be seen throughout dysplastic epithelium, rather than being confined to the basal layer, as is the normal case.\| Dysplasia  is a term that literally means “disordered growth.” It is encountered principally in epithelial cells and is recognized on the basis of several morphologic changes.

### Clonality and Heterogeneity of Tumour

- Why is a malignant neoplasm clonal in origin?
    
    Once a cell acquires sufficient mutations to become a malignant cell, it rapidly undergoes clonal expansion to give rise to a large population of cells
    
- Why does a tumour display heterogeneity despite being monoclonal?
    
    After clonal expansion, the malignant cells of the tumour can continue to acquire mutations and thus diversify in its function, giving it varying ability to invade and metastasize
    
- How does heterogeneity of tumour makes treatment difficult?
    
    Certain treatments only apply selective pressure rather than killing the tumour as a whole
    
    Subpopulations may be able to survive and undergo clonal expansion again
    

### Route of Spread

- How can malignant cells invade through the basement membrane?
    
    By secreting collagenase to cleave the basement membrane and invade through it
    
- Why is metastasis made difficult by our body?
    
    Normal epithelial cells fail to survive in connective tissue as ECM stimulates anoikis
    
    Even if malignant cells enter the blood stream, the blood is a hostile environment for malignant cells:
    
    Lymphocytes attack malignant cells
    
    Platelets clot malignant cells
    
- Describe the route of metastasis via blood stream.
    
    Invade through basal membrane → pass through Connective tissue → Intravastation → Extravastation → Metastatic deposition → Angiogenesis → Growth
    
- State the pathways of spread of a malignant neoplasm.
    
    Local invasion by infiltrative growth
    
    Metastasis by Lymphatic spread
    
    Metastasis by Haematogenous spread
    
    Metastasis by transcoelomic spread (direct seeding of body cavities)
    
    Metastasis by pagetoid spread
    
    Metastasis by perineural spread
    

### Staging

- Describe the staging system of cancer.
    
    T - extent of local invasion
    
    N - extent of lymph node metastasis
    
    M - extent of distant metastasis
    

### Biology of Tumour Growth

- What are the intrinsic factors affecting tumour growth?
    
    Cell proliferation rate
    
    Resistance to cell death
    
    Ability to resist maturation
    
- What are the extrinsic factors affecting tumour growth?
    
    Host immune response
    
    Adequacy of blood supply to support tumour growth
    
    Availability of hormonal and growth factors
