### Gallstones
Gallstones are any stone formations at any level of the biliary tree.
- **There are three types of gallstones:**
    Cholesterol stones, pigmented stones (either black or brown), but more commonly mixed stones are present.
    Cholesterol stones can only be found in the gallbladder, whereas pigmented stones can be found at any level of the biliary tree.
- **Risk factors for gallstones**
    The 4 ‘F’s - Female, forty, fat and fertile
- **Pathogenesis of gallstones**
    Gallstones are mainly caused by **abnormal bile composition**, *either by supersaturation of bile acid pool by cholesterol in cholesterol stones, or an elevation in unconjugated bilirubin in pigmented stones (black).*
    
    Cholesterol stones are mainly caused when cholesterol concentration exceeds the emulsifying capacity of the bile acid pool, and is enhanced in hypomotility of the gallbladder:
    
    - An increase in cholesterol secretion may be caused by obesity or insulin resistance, while a decrease in bile acid pool may be caused by ileal bypass.
    - When the cholesterol concentration exceeds the solubilization capacity of the bile acid pool, it results in crystalization of cholesterol in the gallbladder.
    
    Pigmented stones is formed when the bile contains a high concentration of unconjugated bilirubin, in a patient with haemolysis. This mainly precipitates insoluble calcium bilirubinate, resulting in formation of black gallstones.
    
    Gallstones may also be caused by **inflammation and infections**, either by cholangitis caused by acute bacterial infections, or [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)\|Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC)]].
- **Clinical features of gallstones depends on the level of stone formation in the biliary tree:**
    When stones are present in the gallbladder, 70-80% of individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life. Some develop cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder).
    
    Cystic duct obstruction can result in obstruction of gallbladder emptying, resulting in progressive concentration of bile and chemical irritation. This results in acute or chronic cholecystititis. It may also result in formation of mucocele, which may become infected and results in empyema (a collection of pus in the gallbladder).
    
    Intrahepatic bile duct obstruction often results in cholangitis.
    
    Common bile duct obstruction may result in jaundice, cholangitis, and even pancreatitis (if it is present at the junction between the common bile duct and pancreatic duct).
