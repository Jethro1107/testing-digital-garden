### Necrotising soft tissue infections

There are two entities of necrotising soft tissue infections: 1) *********************Necrotising fasciitis*********************, and 2) *************************************Clostridium myonecrosis (Gas gangrene).*************************************

These infections usually involve a necrotising infection of the deep structures of the skin, involving the deep fascia.

### Necrotising fasciitis

Necrotising fasciitis is involves a rapidly spreading infection of the ******deep fascia******, which spreads along the deep fascia, and causes the necrosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue.

- **************************************************************************Pathogenesis of necrotising fasciitis**************************************************************************
    
    Necrotising fasciitis usually starts with a break in skin which allows the entry of pathogens.
    
    Infection of the deep fascia causes thrombosis of penetrating blood vessels, and destruction of nerve. This manifests as necrosis and anesthesia of the superficial layers of the skin.

- ******************************************************************Etiology of necrotising fasciitis******************************************************************
    
    Necrotising fasciitis can be classified into 3 types by etiology:
    
    - Type 1: Anaerobic bacterium (e.g. Bacterioides and Clostridium), Facultative bacterium (e.g. Streptococci and enterobacterales). These are usually caused by leakage of gut microbe during intra-abdominal and pelvic surgery.
    - Type 2: Streptococcus pyogenes
    - Type 3: Vibrio species, Vibrio vulnificus, usually after exposure to water or consumption of contaminated sea food.
- **********************************************************************************Clinical features of necrotising fasciitis**********************************************************************************
    
    Clinical features of necrotising fasciitis correlates with the pathogenesis of necrotising fasciitis.
    
    Early symptoms include changes fever, pain of the lesion and oedema, that is rapidly spreading.
    
    The skin then changes rapidly, with dusky discolouration of the skin (dark purple, to black), to cyanotic, to dusky black (correlating to full thickness necrosis), while the skin also becomes hyponaesthetic or anaesthetic (correlating to the destruction of nerves). These changes usually progress centrally to the periphery of the lesion.
    
    Individual may also develop septic shock.
    
- ********************************************************************Treatment of necrotising fasciitis********************************************************************
    
    Surgerical debridement and antibiotics.
    
    Antibiotics is not first line of treatment, as thrombosis in its vascular supply prevents antibiotics from reaching the site of infection.
    
    Supportive treatment for sepsis.
    

### Clostridial myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene)

A necrotising soft tissue infection involving necrosis of skeletal muscles, usually caused by **Clostridium perfringens**.

- ******************************************************************************Pathogenesis (and virulence factor) of clostridial myonecrosis******************************************************************************
    
    Clostridial myonecrosis involves a muscle injury and subsequent contamination by soil and foreign material containing clostridium perfringens spores.
    
    Clostridium perfringens is a toxin-mediated disease (primary by alpha-toxins), eventually resulting in myonecrosis.
    
    - Alpha toxin is a lecithinase that causes lyses of erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes and endothelial cells. This results in massive haemolysis, bleeding and tissue distruction.
- ****************************************************************************************Clinical features of clostridial myonecrosis****************************************************************************************
    
    A defining feature of clostridial myonecrosis is subcutaneous emphysema, presence of subcutaneous gas pockets as a result of gas production by the bacteria.
    
    It is also characterised with tense oedema, serosanguineous (containing blood) discharge, and foul odour of the wound.
    
    There is severe systemic manifestations, often resulting in septic shock.
    
- ****************Diagnosis of clostridial myonecrosis****************
    
    Gram stain of wound discharge reveals:
    
    - Gram positive box-like bacilli, with the abscence of leukocytes (as they are killed by toxins)

- ************************************************************************Treatment of clostridial myonecrosis************************************************************************
    
    Surgery and antibiotics (penicillin, clindamycin and metranidazole for clostridium).
