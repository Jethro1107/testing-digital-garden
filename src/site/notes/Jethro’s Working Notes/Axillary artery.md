### Axillary artery

The axillary artery is the continuation of the subclavian artery which begins at the lateral border of the 1st rib and ends at the lower border of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Teres major\|Teres major]] (i.e. within the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Axilla\|Axilla]]), where it becomes continuous with the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial artery\|Brachial artery]].

- ********************************************************************************There are 3 parts of the axillary artery********************************************************************************
    
    The axillary artery is separated into 3 parts:
    
    - The 1st part of the axillary artery is proximal to the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pectoralis minor\|Pectoralis minor]]
    - The 2nd part of the axillary artery is posterior to the pectoralis minor
    - The 3rd part of the axillary artery is distal to the pectoralis minor
- **********************************************************************************6 branches arise from the axillary artery**********************************************************************************
    
    1st part of the axillary artery:
    
    **Superior thoracic artery** - Which branches from the anterior surface of the 1st part of the axillary artery and runs through the 1st and 2nd intercostal space, supplying the structures in the intercostal space.
    
    2nd part of axillary artery:
    
    **Thoracoacromial artery** - Which branches from the anterior surface of the 2nd part of the axillary artery, posterior to the medial margin of the pectoralis minor. It is a short artery which gives rise to the acromial branch, deltoid branch, clavicular branch and pectoral branch.
    
    **Lateral thoracic artery** - Which branches from the anterior surface of the 2nd part of the axillary artery, posterior to the lateral margins of the pectoralis minor. It descends along the medial axillary wall.
    
    3rd part of axillary artery:
    
    **Anterior circumflex humeral artery** - It crosses the surgical neck anteriorly and anastamose with the posterior circumflex humeral artery.
    
    **Posterior circumflex humeral artery** - It leaves the axilla via the **quadrangular space**, and crosses the surgical neck posteriorly, anastamosing the the anterior circumflex humeral artery.
    
    **Subscapular artery**, which gives rise to the **circumflex scapular artery** and **thoracodorsal artery**.
    
    - **Circumflex scapular artery** leaves the axilla via the **triangular space** and access the posterior scapular region, it forms anastamoses with other arteries of the region, contributing to [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Scapular anastamosis\|Scapular anastamosis]].
    - **Thoracodorsal artery**, which descends along the lateral border of the scapulae and supply the muscles that form the posterior and medial axillary wall.
