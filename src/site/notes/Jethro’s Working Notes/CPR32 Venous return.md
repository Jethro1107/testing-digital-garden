### Venous return

- **Definition of venous return**
    
    Volume flow rate of blood returning from systemic circulation into the right atrium of the heart, which is via superior and inferior vena cava
    
- Cardiac function curve
    - **Frank-staring mechanism of control of cardiac output by venous return**
        
        When venous return increase, volume of blood returning back to the right atrium increases, resulting in increased right atrial pressure
        
        This increases preload and hence contractile force of right atrium
        
        As a result, preload of right ventricle, left atrium and eventually left ventricle increases, resulting in increase in stroke volume, and increase in cardiac output
        
        Less significantly, increase in venous return stretches the right atrium stimulates volume receptors in the right atrium, stimulating the bainbridge reflex, resulting in increased heart rate and increase in cardiac output
        
        [[(Guyton and Hall Chapter 9 - Intrinsic control of the heart pumping - the Frank-Starling mechanism)\|(Guyton and Hall Chapter 9 - Intrinsic control of the heart pumping - the Frank-Starling mechanism)]] 
        
    - **Relationship between cardiac output and right atrial pressure in cardiac function curve**
        
        When right atrial pressure increase, cardiac output increase
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - Limits of cardiac output
- **Driving force of venous return**
    
    The ultimate driving force of venous return is the pumping of the heart
    
- Venous pressures
    - **Definition of central venous pressure**
        
        Central venous pressure (CVP) - the pressure of the vena cava at the right atrium, considered equal to right atrial pressure
        
    - Control of central venous pressure
        
        [[Cardiovascular physiology concept Chapter 5  Summary of factors affecting central venous pressure\|Cardiovascular physiology concept Chapter 5  Summary of factors affecting central venous pressure]] 
        
    - **Definition of peripheral venous pressure**
        
        Peripheral venous return (PVP) - the pressure in peripheral veins in different tissues
        
- Venous return curve
    - **Control of venous return by cardiac output and effects on venous pressures**
        
        When cardiac output decrease, venous return decrease, and less blood is leaving from venous system and entering arterial system
        
        As more blood is accumulated in vena cava and right atrium, central venous pressure increase
        
        As more blood accumulate in peripheral veins, peripheral venous pressure increase
        
        When cardiac output increase, venous return increase, and more blood is leaving from venous system and entering arterial system
        
        Less blood is accumulated in vena cava and right atrium, central venous pressure decrease
        
        Less blood is accumulated in peripheral veins, peripheral venous pressure decrease
        
    - **Relationship between venous return and central venous pressure in venous return curve**
        
        When central venous pressure increase, venous return decrease
        
        This is because venous return is driven by a pressure gradient, as central venous pressure increase, the pressure gradient decrease, and thus venous return decrease
        
        The slope of the curve represents the resistance of veins

    - **Cause of plateau of venous return in negative central venous return**
        
        Negative central venous pressure causes the large veins to collapse, increasing resistance, and thus impeding blood flow back to the heart
        
        ([[Guyton and Hall Chapter 20  Plateau in venous return curve at negative atrial pressures caused by collapse of the large veins\|Guyton and Hall Chapter 20  Plateau in venous return curve at negative atrial pressures caused by collapse of the large veins]])
        
    - **Definition of mean systemic filling pressure**
        
        Mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) refers to the intravascular pressure when there is no blood flow 
        
        If the heart ceases to pump, intravascular pressure will equilibriate, resulting in no blood flow. and hence no venous return
        
- Venous return and cardiac output
    - **Why is venous return and cardiac output equal?**
        
        Cardiovascular system is a closed system, and that CO and VR are interdependent, such that they would eventually equlibriate at steady state
        
    - **Effects of decreased venous compliance on venous return, cardiac output and mean systemic filling pressure**
        
        When venous compliance decrease, less blood accumulates in peripheral veins, resulting in increased venous return at any central venous pressure, causing a rightward shift of venous return curve
        
        This results in an increase in venous return, resulting in increased central venous pressure, and an increase in cardiac output
        
        Mean systemic filling pressure also increases, as increase in venous compliance shifts blood from the unstressed volume (veins) to the stressed volume (arteries)
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Effects of increased blood volume on venous return, cardiac output and mean systemic filling pressure**
        
        When blood volume increase cause an increase in mean systemic filling pressure, thus causing the venous return curve to shift to the right
        
        As a result, venous return increase, causing an increase in central venous pressure, and an increase in cardiac output
        
        Mean systemic blood pressure would also increase
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Effects of positive inotropic agents on cardiac output and venous return**
        
        Positive inotropic agents cause an increase in contractility, thus increasing cardiac output at any right atrial pressure, causing the cardiac output curve to shift upward
        
        An increase in cardiac output results in decreased central venous pressure and increased venous return
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    - **Effects to increased total peripheral resistance on cardiac output and venous return**
        
        Increase in total peripheral resistance results in decreased blood flow, and hence decreased venous return , causing a downward shift of venous return curve
        
        Increase in total peripheral resistance also results in increased arterial pressure (as vasoconstriction of arterioles holds blood in arterial system) and afterload, resulting in decreased cardiac output, and a downward shift of cardiac output curve

### Factors affecting venous return at the lower libs

- Gravitational force (posture)
    - **Effects of gravitational force on venous return, cardiac output and mean arterial pressure in standing position**
        
        In a standing position, gravitational forces cause blood to accumulate in lower extremities, particularly in veins as they are more compliant than arteries, causing an increase in volume and pressures in veins
        
        This decreases venous return, thus reducing preload and decreasing cardiac output, and thus mean arterial pressure decrease
        
        Normally, the decrease in mean arterial pressure is corrected by baroreceptor reflex:
        
        Decrease in mean arterial pressure results in decreased baroreceptor firing, resulting in increased sympathetic activity, increasing cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, restoring mean arterial pressure
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        [[Effects of standing on systolic and diastolic blood pressure\|Effects of standing on systolic and diastolic blood pressure]] 
        
    - Orthostatic hypotension
        - **Definition of orthostatic hypotension**
            
            Defined as a 20mmHg drop in systolic pressure or 10mmHg drop in diastolic pressure within 3 minutes of standing
            
        - **Symptoms of orthostatic hypotension**
            
            Lightheadedness, fatigue, syncope (due to decreased cerebral blood flow)
            
        - **Common cause of orthostatic hypotension**
            
            Medication: Diuretics, or vasodilators
            
            Dehydration or blood loss
            
            Reduced baroreceptor sensitivity
            
- Skeletal muscle pump
    - **Mechanism of skeletal muscle pump in venous return during exercise**
        
        Other than baroreceptor reflex, skeletal muscle pump is another mechanism that counteracts effects of gravity of venous pressure
        
        Veins in lower limbs consist of one way valves to prevent retrograde flow of blood
        
        During skeletal muscle contraction, the upper valve remains open and the lower valve close, thus allowing blood to flow up, facilitating venous return
        
        This is a mechanism to increase venous return during exercise as to increase cardiac output

    - Varicose veins
        - **Pathophysiology of varicose veins**
            
            In chronic elevation of peripheral venous pressure, peripheral veins becomes overstretched, espiecially in lower limb
            
            This gradually damages the venous wall, causing overdilation, forming varicose veins
            
            The one way valves become incompetent, allowing regurgitation of blood, causing skeletal muscle pump to be ineffective in promoting venous return
            
        - **Symptoms of varicose veins**
            
            Accumulation of blood in peripheral veins results in increase in venous pressure and capillary pressure, and is associated with peripheral oedema
            
        - **Management of varicose veins**
            
            Wear compression stockings:
            
            - Increase velocity of blood flow by reducing cross-sectional area of veins
- Intra-abdominal pressure
    - **Effects of intra-abdominal pressure in pregnancy on venous return and venous pressure during pregnancy**
        
        During pregnancy, intra-abdominal pressure increase, compressing the inferior vena cava
        
        This causes reduced blood flow via inferior vena cava, and hence reduced venous return
        
        This also results in increased peripheral venous pressure as blood accumulates in peripheral veins, thus resulting in peripheral oedema during pregnancy
        

### Factors affecting venous return and cardiac output at the thorax

- Respiratory activity
    - **Determinants of blood flow from abdominal part of inferior vena cava to right atrium**
        
        Pressure difference between abdominal parts of IVC and right atrium of heart
        
        Resistance to blood flow (IVC diameter)
        
    - **Effects of respiratory activity on venous return and stroke volume of the right heart**
        
        During inspiration:
        
        Intrapleural pressure decreases, which pulls on the walls of the right heart and thoracic IVC, causing decrease pressure of right atrium and thoracic IVC
        
        Hence, the pressure difference between abdominal part of IVC and right atrium of heart increase, resulting in increased venous return
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
        Thus, preload increase, and right ventricle stroke volume increase
        
        During expiration:
        
        Intrapleural pressure increases, which compresses on the walls of right heart and thoracic IVC, causing increase pressure of right atrium and thoracic IVC
        
        Hence, the pressure difference between abdominal part of IVC and right atrium of heart decrease, resulting in decreased venous return
        
        Thus, preload decrease and right ventricular stroke volume decrease
        
        [[Cardiovascular physiology concepts Chapter 5  Effects of respiratory activity on venous return\|Cardiovascular physiology concepts Chapter 5  Effects of respiratory activity on venous return]] 
        
    - **Effects of respiratory activity on stroke volume of left heart**
        
        During inspiration:
        
        Intrapleural pressure decreases, which stretches the walls of the left atrium and left ventricle, causing decrease in pressure of left atrium and left ventricle
        
        But the pulmonary vasculature expands and increase capacitence, such that blood is held within the circulation
        
        Hence, preload is not enhanced
        
        During expiration:
        
        Intrapleural pressure increases, the lung deflates and forces blood out of pulmonary circulation
        
        Hence, LA and LV preload is increased, causing increase in left ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output
        
    - **Effects of increased rate and depth of respiration on venous return and cardiac output**
        
        Increased venous return and increased cardiac output
        
    - Tension pneumothorax
        - **Effects of tension penumothorax on venous return**
            
            Tension pneumothorax results in an increase in intrapleural pressure, which compresses on superior and inferior vena cava, impeding venous return
