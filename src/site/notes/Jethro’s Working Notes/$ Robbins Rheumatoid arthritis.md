## Rheumatoid Arthritis

**Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that principally attacks the joints, producing a nonsuppurative proliferative and inflammatory synovitis.** RA often progresses to articular cartilage destruction and, in some cases, joint fusion *(ankylosis)* . Extraarticular lesions may involve skin, heart, blood vessels, and lungs, leading to clinical manifestations that overlap with other autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma. The prevalence of RA in the United States is approximately 1%. The incidence peaks in the second to fourth decades. RA is three times more common in women than in men.

## Pathogenesis

**The autoimmune response in RA is initiated by CD4+ helper T cells.** As in other autoimmune diseases, genetic predisposition and environmental factors contribute to the development, progression, and persistence of disease. The pathologic changes in RA are mediated by antibodies against self antigens and inflammation induced by cytokines, predominantly those secreted by CD4+ T cells ( [Fig. 26.42](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0220) ).

The activated CD4+ T cells release inflammatory mediators that stimulate other inflammatory cells, leading to tissue injury. Although many cytokine mediators can be isolated from inflamed joints, the most important ones include:

- IFN-γ from Th1 cells, which activates macrophages and resident synovial cells.
- IL-17 from Th17 cells that recruits neutrophils and monocytes.
- RANKL, which is expressed on activated T cells and stimulates bone resorption.
- TNF and IL-1 from macrophages stimulate resident synovial cells to secrete proteases that destroy hyaline cartilage.

Of these, TNF has been most firmly implicated in RA pathogenesis, and anti-TNF biologics have revolutionized its treatment (see later).

In RA, the synovium often contains germinal centers with secondary follicles and abundant plasma cells. Some of these plasma cells secrete antibodies that recognize self antigens. Many of these autoantibodies, which are produced in lymphoid organs as well as synovium, are specific for citrullinated peptides (CCPs) in which arginine residues are post-translationally converted to citrulline. The modified epitopes are found in several proteins found in joints, including fibrinogen, type II collagen, α-enolase, and vimentin. *Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies* (ACPAs) are diagnostic markers that can be detected in serum of up to 70% of RA patients. Some data suggest that, in combination with T cells reactive to citrullinated proteins, ACPAs drive disease persistence. IgM and IgA autoantibodies that bind to IgG Fc regions are present in 80% of individuals. These autoantibodies, collectively referred to as *rheumatoid factor,* may be deposited in joints as immune complexes, but are not present in all patients and can be detected in some individuals without RA.

It is estimated that 50% of the risk of developing RA is related to inherited genetic susceptibility. The *HLA-DR4* allele is associated with ACPA-positive RA. Evidence suggests that an epitope on a citrullinated protein, vinculin, mimics an epitope on many microbes and can be presented by the class II HLA-DR4 molecule.

Environmental factors that promote autoimmunity are involved, but as in many autoimmune diseases, they have not been clearly defined. For example, infection (including periodontitis) and smoking may promote citrullination of self proteins, creating new epitopes that trigger autoantibody production.

**MORPHOLOGY**

RA typically affects small joints of the hands and feet. The synovium becomes grossly edematous, thickened, and hyperplastic, transforming its smooth contour to one covered by delicate and bulbous villi ( [Fig. 26.43A–B](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0225) ). The characteristic histologic features include (1) synovial cell hyperplasia and proliferation; (2) dense inflammatory infiltrates (frequently forming lymphoid follicles) of CD4+ helper T cells, B cells, plasma cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages (see [Fig. 26.43](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0225) ); (3) increased vascularity due to angiogenesis; (4) fibrin-rich exudate on the synovial and joint surfaces; and (5) osteoclastic activity in subchondral bone, allowing the inflamed synovium to penetrate the bone and cause periarticular erosions and subchondral cysts. Together, these changes produce the **pannus,** a mass of edematous synovium, inflammatory cells, granulation tissue, and fibroblasts that grows over and causes erosion of articular cartilage. In time, after the cartilage has been destroyed, the pannus bridges the apposing bones to form a **fibrous ankylosis,** which eventually ossifies and results in bone fusion, or bony ankylosis.

**Rheumatoid nodules** are an infrequent manifestation of RA and typically occur in the subcutaneous tissue of the forearm, elbows, occiput, and lumbosacral area. These small masses are firm, nontender, and round to oval. Microscopically, they resemble necrotizing granulomas with a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by a prominent rim of activated macrophages and numerous lymphocytes and plasma cells ( [Fig. 26.44](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0230) ). Severe disease may be associated with **leukocytoclastic vasculitis** ( [Chapter 11](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B978032353113900011X?scrollTo=%23c00011) ), an acute necrotizing vasculitis of small and large arteries that may involve pleura, pericardium, or lung and evolve into a chronic fibrosing process. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis produces purpura, cutaneous ulcers, and nail bed infarction. Ocular changes such as uveitis and keratoconjunctivitis (similar to Sjögren syndrome, [Chapter 6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/#!/content/3-s2.0-B9780323531139000066?scrollTo=%23c00006) ) may also occur.

## Clinical Features

RA may be distinguished from other forms of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis serologically by ACPA detection and radiographically by characteristic changes (see later). It begins with malaise, fatigue, and generalized musculoskeletal pain in about half of patients; joint involvement develops after weeks to months. The pattern of joint involvement varies, but it is generally symmetrical and affects small joints before larger ones. Symptoms usually develop in the hands and feet, followed in decreasing frequency by the wrists, ankles, elbows, and knees. In the hands, the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints are involved, in contrast to OA (see earlier).

Involved joints are swollen, warm, and painful. Unlike OA, morning joint stiffness does not subside with activity. The typical patient has progressive joint enlargement and decreasing range of motion during a chronic waxing and waning course. In a minority of individuals, especially those lacking ACPA and rheumatoid factor, disease may stabilize or even regress. A small number of patients (about 10%) develop acute-onset RA, with severe symptoms and polyarticular involvement that develops over several days.

Inflammation in tendons, ligaments, and occasionally adjacent skeletal muscle frequently accompanies the arthritis and produces characteristic radial deviation of the wrist, ulnar deviation of the fingers, and flexion-hyperextension of the fingers (swan-neck and boutonnière deformities). Radiographic hallmarks include joint effusions and juxta-articular osteopenia with erosions and narrowing of the joint space and loss of articular cartilage ( [Fig. 26.45](https://www-clinicalkey-com.eproxy.lib.hku.hk/f0235) ).

RA treatment is aimed at relieving pain and inflammation and slowing or arresting joint destruction. Therapies include corticosteroids, other immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, and, most notably, TNF antagonists, which are effective in many patients. Unfortunately, individuals must be maintained on anti-TNF therapy to avoid disease flares. This long-term treatment with anti-TNF agents predisposes individuals to infection with opportunistic organisms such as *M. tuberculosis* . Other biologic agents that interfere with T- and B-lymphocyte responses have also been approved for therapeutic use.
