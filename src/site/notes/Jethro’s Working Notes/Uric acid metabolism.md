### Uric acid metabolism

- ******************Synthesis******************
    
    Uric acid is the end product on purine catabolism, where purines is the product of 2 interlinked pathways: 1) *****************De novo pathway,***************** 2) ****************Salvage pathway.****************
    
    The salvage pathways involves purine synthesis from purine bases obtained from diet, or from purine nucleotides obtained from cellular turnover.
    
- ******************Excretion******************
    
    Uric acid undergoes both renal excretion and biliary excretion.
    
    - 2/3 undergoes renal excretion, where uric acid is freely filtered in the renal corpuscles, most of it is reabsorbed in the PCT, and a small amount is secreted in the DCT.
    - 1/3 undergoes gut excretion, and are degraded by gut microbes.
