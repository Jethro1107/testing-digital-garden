### Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve

The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2-3) originates from the posterior divisions of anterior rami of L2-L3.

As the nerve emerges from the psoas major, it courses obliquely on the iliacus towards the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). It then passes under the inguinal ligament ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Gateways to the lower limb\|Gateways to the lower limb]]).

- **Once distal to the inguinal ligament, it branches into the anterior branch and posterior branch, which provides:**
    - The anterior branch provides sensory innervation of the anterolateral part of the thigh
    - The posterior branch provides sensory innervation of the lateral part of the thigh.
