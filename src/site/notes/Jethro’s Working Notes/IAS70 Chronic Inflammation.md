### Chronic Inflammation

- Define chronic inflammation.
    
    Chronic inflammation is inflammation of prolonged duration (weeks or months) in which inflammation, tissue destruction and repair proceeds at the same time
    
- What are the causes of chronic inflammation?
    1. Following on acute inflammation
        
        Due to persistence of inciting stimulus or interference of normal healing process - Unresolved acute inflammation
        
        - Chronic osteomyelitis, chronic abscess
        
        Due to repeated bouts of acute inflammation 
        
        - Chronic pyelonephritis
        - Chronic cholecytitis
    2. Distinct process from the outset
        
        Characterised from brief and minimal acute phase, with a low-grade smoldering response, caused by:
        
        1. Viral infection
            
            Hepatitis B infection
            
        2. Persistant infection
            
            Mycobacterium tuberculosis - TB
            
            Mycobacterium leprae - Leprosy
            
            Treponema pallium - Syphillus
            
            Fungi
            
        3. Insoluble particles
            
            Silica, asbestos or other foreign bodies (exogenous)
            
            Cholesterol (endogenous)
            
        4. Hypersensitivity
            
            Non-infective condition e.g. Contact dermatitis
            
            Autoimmune condition e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis
            
- Give examples of diseases in which pathogenesis may involves chronic inflammation.
    
    Certain cancers
    
    Alzheimers
    
    Metabolic syndrome
    
    Type 2 diabetes Mellitus
    
- What are the histological hallmarks of chronic inflammation?
    
    Mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate - Macrophages, Lymphocytes, Plasma cells
    
    Granulation tissue
    
    Tissue destruction and fibrosis
    
    Regeneration
    
- What are the different mechanisms from macrophage infiltration?
    
    Recruitment from circulating monocytes and transformation into macrophages
    
    Activation of macrophages by cytokines
    
    Local proliferation and immobilization of macrophages (Contrast with acute which is only exudative)
    
- What are the effects of activated macrophages in chronic inflammation?
    
    Eliminate microbes and to initiate repair process
    
    Responsible for much of the tissue damage in chronic inflammation

- Describe the process of lymphocyte recruitment and activation.
    
    Activated macrophages secret IL-1 and TNF to attract lymphocytes, and activate lymphocytes by antigen presentation
    
    Activated T cells can release circulating monocytes by releasing cytokines, and further activate macrophages by release of INF-gamma
    
    Bilateral interaction of lymphocytes and macrophages makes the inflammatory response to be chronic and severe
    
- Describe the formation and function of plasma cells.
    
    Derived from activated B lymphocytes
    
    Produce antibodies directed against foreign antigen (or self antigen in autoimmune diseases)
    
- Describe the morphology of the three mononucleated inflammatory cells.
    
    Macrophages - Abundant clear cytoplasm
    
    Lymphocyte - Azurophilic, scanty cytoplasm
    
    Plasma cells - Eccentrically located nucleus, pinkish cytoplasm
    
- What are the other cells present in chronic inflammation?
    
    Eosinophils - Abundant in immune reactions mediated by IgE and in parasitic infection
    
    Mast cells - responsible in allergic reactions
    
    Neutrophils - induced by persistence of microbe or mediators produced by activated lymphocytes and macrophages
    
- What is present in granulation tissues?
    
    An ingrowth of vascular tissue surrounded by connective tissue
    
    Contains thin-walled capillaries, fibroblast and inflammatory cells
    
- Elaborate on tissue damage and fibrosis in chronic inflammation.
    
    Tissue destruction is due to the persistence of offending agents, or mediated by inflammatory cells
    
    Fibrosis and scarring due to formation of large amount of granulation tissue
    
    Adhesions (band of fibrous tissues between organs)
    
- Elaborate on regeneration in chronic inflammation.
    
    As long as there is constant inflammation, there will be stimulus for regeneration
    
    Regeneration of destroyed tissue, may result in epithelial overgrowth or invagination
    
    Endarteritis obliterans, proliferation of in artery results in narrowing in artery lumen
    
- What are the general effects of chronic inflammation?
    
    Fever, APP, leukocytosis
    
    Hyperplasia of lymphoid system
    
    Immune response with antibody production
    
    Reactive systemic amyloidosis with formation of AA protein
    

### Granulomatous Inflammation

- What is granulomatous inflammation?
    
    Distinctive pattern of chronic inflammation in which predominant cell type is activated macrophages showing epitheliod arrangement
    
- How is granulomatous inflammation induced?
    
    Often induced by cell-mediated immune response to inciting agents that are poorly degradable
    
    Macrophages are activated and transformed into epitheloid cells and fused to form giant cells to form a granuloma
    
- What is a granuloma?
    
    A focus of chronic inflammation consisting of microscopic aggregation of activated macrophages that are transformed into epitheloid cells, surrounded by a collar of mononucleated leukocytes, principally lymphocytes and occasionally mast cells
    
    Central necrosis may be present
    
    ![[/Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 12.04.08 PM.png\|/Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 12.04.08 PM.png]]
    
- What are the different types of granuloma?
    
    Foreign body granuloma - Incited by inert foreign bodies, usually too large to be phagocytosed by a single macrophage, epitheloid and giant cells apposed to the surface of foreign body, foreign body tends to locate centrally of the granuloma
    
    Immunologic granuloma - Incited by poorly degradable inciting agent capable of inducting cell-mediated immune response. The inciting agent is phagocytosed by a macrophage, and is presented to T cell for activation. Activated T cell in turn secrets INF-gamma for macrophage activation and formation of granuloma
    
- What are the characteristics of granulomatous infection seen in tuberculosis?
    
    Tubercles - Aggregate of epitheliod cells and Langhans' multinucleated giant cells
    
    Langhans' giant cell - nucleus arranged in horseshoe shape 
    
    Caseous necrosis in center
    
    Acid fast bacilli
    
- What are the different types of tuberculosis?
    
    Primary TB - Infection of individual lacking previous contact with M. tuberculosis
    
    Secondary TB/ Post-primary TB - Arise in previously sensitized individual due to reactivation
    
    Milliary TB - M. tuberculosis gains access to lymphatics and blood to seed distant organs
    
- Compare the morphology of different giant cells.
    
    Langhans' giant cell - nucleus arranged in horseshoe shape around the periphery
    
    Foreign body giant cell - nucleus arranged haphazardly
    
    Touton giant cell - nucleus arranged in a ring
