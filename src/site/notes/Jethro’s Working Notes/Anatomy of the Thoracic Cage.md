## Anatomy of the thoracic cage

- The thoracic cage forms the borders of the thorax (a body region)
- **Function of the thoracic cage**
    1. To **protect** internal organs (heart, lungs) and great vessels (aorta, superior vena cava)
    2. To provide surfaces for **attachment** of muscles such as intercostal muscles, pectoralis major, minor, scalene muscles and sternocleidomastoid muscle
- **General structure of the thoracic cage**
    
    The skeleton of the thoracic wall forms an osteocartilaginous thoracic cage, which includes:
    
    12 pairs of **ribs** and **costal cartilages**,
    
    12 **thoracic vertebrae** and intervertebral discs,
    
    The **sternum**
    
    (Moore’s Essential Clinical Anatomy p.52)
    
    - Ribs
        - **Ribs are classified by their anterior articulation to the sternum**
            
            True ribs (First 7 of the 12 ribs):
            
            - so-called because they **attach directly** to the sternum through their **own costal cartilages** (i.e. They have their own costal cartilages)
            
            False ribs (8th to 10th ribs):
            
            - [[Their costal cartilages attach to the cartilage of the rib just superior to them\|Their costal cartilages attach to the cartilage of the rib just superior to them]]; thus **their connection to the sternum is indirect**
            
            Floating ribs (11th and 12th ribs):
            
            - Their costal cartilage **do not connect** even indirectly with the sternum
            
            (Moore’s Essential Clinical Anatomy p.52)
            
        - **Structure of a typical rib**
            
            Typical rib - 3rd to 9th rib, consist of a head, a neck, a tubercle and a body
            
            **Head** - Consist of 2 articular facets separated by the crest of the head, one for articulating with the numerically corresponding thoracic vertebrae and the other for articulating with the vertebra superior to it (i.e. One facet of 2nd rib articulate with T2, and other for T1)
            
            **Neck** - at the level of the tubercle, connects head with body
            
            Tubercle - Above the neck, consist of an articular facet for articulating with the corresponding transverse process of the vertebra
            
            **Body (shaft)** - Thin, flat and curved, marked at the angle where the rib turns anterolaterally
            
            The concave internal surface of the body has a costal groove which contains the neurovascular bundle with the intercostal vein, artery and nerve (VAN)
            
            Distal end of the articulate with costal cartilage anteriorly

        - **Typical ribs articulate to the vertebral column at two joints**
            
            Costovertebral joint - The 2 articular facets of the **head** of the rib articulate to 2 vertebrae, one articulate to the numerically corresponding vertebrae (i.e. one articular facet of 2nd rib articulate to T2), and the other articulates to the superior vertebrae
            
            Costotransverse joint - The articular facets of the tubercles of the rib articulates to the costal facets on their transverse processes
            
            **Both are synovial joints, allowing free movement**
            
        - The upper and lower ribs are atypical ribs due to their atypical articulation to the vertebral column
            
            The 1st, 2nd, 10th, 11th and 12th ribs are atypical ribs.
            
            In the 1st rib, the scalene tubercle is located on the superior surface of the body, which acts as an articular site of the anterior scalene muscle
            
            The 1st and 2nd ribs lie flat along the transverse plane, where the head only consist of 1 articular facets as they only articulate to their numerically corresponding vertebrae
            
            The 10th rib is also atypical as the head only consist of 1 articular facets as it only articulates to T10
            
            The 11th and 12th ribs are atypical as their heads only consist of 1 articular facets as they only articulate to their numerically corresponding vertebrae. Furthermore, they lack the tubercle and thus they do not articulate to the transverse process

    - **Structure of the sternum**
        
        The sternum consist of three structures - The **Manubrium**, the **body**, and the **Xiphoid** **process**
        
        The **manubrium** consist of articular sites for clavicles  (2 Clavicular Notch (partaking in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Sternoclavicular joint\|Sternoclavicular joint]]) separated by a jugular notch)
        
        The **manubrium** consist of an articulate facet for the first rib, which is a **cartilaginous joint**
        
        The **body** articulates with the **manubrium** to form the **manubriosternal joint** at around T4/T5, forming the sternal angle
        
        The second rib articulates to the sternum at the articular demifacets between the menubrium and the body
        
        On the **body**, articular facets are found for rib 3 to 6, which are **synovial joint**
        
        The distal end of the **body** articulates with the **xiphoid process** to form the **xiphisternal joint**
        
        Between the body and xiphoid process, articular facets are found for rib 7, which is also a **synovial joint**
        
        **Costal cartilages** are hyaline cartilages connect the first 7 ribs to the lateral parts of the sternum, and the 8th, 9th and 10th rib to the costal cartilage immediately above (i.e. the 7th costal cartilage)

- Intercostal space
    - **The five muscles of the intercostal space - structure and function**
        1. External intercostal muscle (Active in inspiration)
            
            The fibres of the external intercostal muscles course superiolaterally to inferomedially, enabling them to elevate the ribs 
            
            At the sternum, the external intercostal muscles form the external intercostal membrane
            
        2. Internal intercostal muscle (Active in exhalation)
            
            The fibres of the internal intercostal muscles course superiomedially to inferolaterally, enabling them to depress the ribs
            
            At the vertebrae, the internal intercostal muscles form the internal intercostal membrane
            
        3. Innermost intercostal muscle 
            
            The fibres of the innermost intercostal muscles course superiomedially to inferolaterally, enabling them to depress the ribs
            
        4. Thoracis transversus muscle/Sternocostalis (Cross more than one intercostal space)
            
            The thoracis transversus muscle is found on the anterior chest wall
            
            It originates from the sternum and inserts on the costal cartilages of the 3rd to 6th rib
            
        5. Subcostalis (Cross more than one intercostal space)
            
            The subcostalis is found on the posterior chest wall
            
            It originates from a rib and spans multiple ribs, inserting to the internal surface of the ribs below
            
    - **Intercostal veins, arteries and nerves are found in the costal groove**
        
        The intercostal VAN bundle can be found in the costal groove of the ribs, between the internal intercostal muscles and the innermost intercostal muscles
        
- Blood Supply of Thoracic Cage
    - **Arterial supply of the chest wall**
        
        **Posterior IC arteries:**
        
        In the 1st and 2nd intercostal space, the posterior intercostal arteries are derived from the supreme (or superior) intercostal artery, derived from the subclavian artery
        
        In the 3rd to 11th intercostal space, the posterior intercostal arteries are derived directly from the thoracic aorta
        
        Subcostal artery derived from the thoracic aorta provides arterial supply below the 12th rib
        
        **Anterior IC arteries:**
        
        In the 1st to 6th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal arteries are derived from the internal thoracic artery (ITA), which is derived from the subclavian artery
        
        In the 7th to 9th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal arteries are derived from the musculophrenic artery, a terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery, that supplies the 7th to 9th anterior intercostal arteries and the diaphragm
        
        - What is the other terminal branch of the internal thoracic artery?
            
            The superior epigastric artery ([[  Arterial supply and venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall  \|  Arterial supply and venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall  ]]), which supplies the rectus abdominis muscle ([[Vertical muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall\|Vertical muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall]]).
            
    - **Venous drainage of the chest wall**
        
        **Right Posterior IC veins:**
        
        In the 1st and 2nd right intercostal space, the right posterior intercostal veins drain into the right superior intercostal veins, which eventually drain into the azygos vein
        
        In the 3rd to 11th right intercostal space, the right posterior intercostal veins drain directly into the azygos vein
        
        **Left Posterior IC veins:**
        
        In the 1st and 2nd left intercostal space, the left posterior intercostal veins drain into the left superior intercostal vein, which drains into the left brachiocephalic vein or acessory hemiazygos vein
        
        In the 3rd to 11th left intercostal space, the left posterior intercostal veins drain into the hemiazygos vein
        
        The subcostal vein also drains into the hemiazygos vein
        
        Both the hemiazygos vein and the accessory hemiazygos vein eventually drain into the azygos vein
        
        **Anterior IC veins:**
        
        In the 1st to 6th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal veins directly drain into the internal thoracic vein
        
        In the 7th to 9th intercostal space, the anterior intercostal veins drain into the musculophrenic vein, which drain into the internal thoracic vein subsequently
