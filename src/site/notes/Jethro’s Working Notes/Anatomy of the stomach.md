### Anatomy of the stomach

The stomach is a dilated portion of the GI tract that serves functions such as physical and chemical digestion. It also serves as a food resevoir.

- **The isolated stomach can be classified into 4 regions:**
    
    The **cardia** - The proximal part of the stomach that is the opening of the oesophagus into the stomach.
    
    The **fundus** - The dome-shaped part of the stomach that is above the level of the cardial oriface.
    
    The **body** - The largest region of the stomach.
    
    The **pylorus** - The most distal part of the stomach, further separated into the antrum and the pyloric canal. *The pylorus always sits at the transpyloric plane at L1.*

- **Other features of the stomach include:**
    1. The greater and the lesser curvature
    2. Gastric rugae

The stomach is supplied by the celiac trunk and its major branches ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Arterial supply of the stomach\|Arterial supply of the stomach]]).

- **Innervation of the stomach**
    
    Gastric plexus
    
    The stomach receives its sympathetic innervation from the greater splanchnic nerve (T5-T9).
    
    The stomach receives its parasympathetic supply from the vagal nerves, in forms of the anterior vagal branches (derivative of left vagus nerve) and the posterior vagal branches (derivative of right vagus nerve).
