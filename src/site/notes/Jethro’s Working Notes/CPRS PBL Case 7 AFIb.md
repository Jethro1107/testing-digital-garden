### Pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation

Irritated atrial myocardium depolarize, forming ectopic foci and re-entry circuits that sends of action potential

Multiple ectopic foci sends of action potential to AV node at irregular time intervals

Irregularly irregular heart beat (QRS complex)

### Clinical features of atrial fibrillations

May be assymptomatic

Palpitations

Fatigue

SOB

Syncope

### Diagnostic approach to palpitations

Narrowing down cause

Hx of palpitations

Onset - children (SVT) vs adult (SVT, AFib, AF)

Duration of palpitations:

Instantaneous - Premature beats

Prolonged - SVT, Afib, AF

Aggrevating factor:

Exercise associated with SVT and AFib

Family history of conduction system disease?

ECG changes

Holters monitor (outpatient continuous studies)

Exercise stress test

No discrete P waves - fibrillatory P waves

Irregular R-R intervals (Irregularly irregular)

### Risk factors of atrial fibrillation

1. Stretch of atria - CHF, Dilated cardiomyopathy, Mitral stenosis
2. Inflammation - Rheumatic heart disease, Alcohol (Holiday heart syndrome)
3. Hypoxia of atria - CAD, COPD, Pneumonia
4. Electrolyte imbalance - Hypomagnesia, Hypokalemia
5. Elevated sympathetic activity

### Complications of Atrial fibrillation

Embolization - MI and stroke, splenic infarct, renal infarct etc.

Heart failure

Cognitive impairment

Cardiogenic shock - Heart rate too fast (>>>150), decrease in EDV, decrease in stroke volume, decrease in cardiac output

### Management of Atrial fibrillation

- Reversion to sinus rhythm - If HD unstable â†’ Direct current cardioversion
- Maintenance of sinus rhythm
- Slowing the ventricular rate in persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation
- Prevention of systemic embolization and stroke, both at the time of reversion and in patients chronically

There are two broad management issues that must be addressed early in patients with new onset AF: the prevention of systemic embolization and the choice between a rhythm or rate control strategy, both of which may improve symptoms.

Rate control - Beta-blockers (Metoprolol) and calcium channel blockers (Diltiazem), digoxin and amiodarone is also used

After rate is controlled, time to prevent embolization - Start anticoagulant therapy? (CHA2DS2-VAS2 Score)

Is it necessary to convert patient into sinus rhythm (consider cardioversion/ Rhythm control) - Class Ia, Class Ic, Class III drugs

Cardioversion depends on 2 things: How long they are out of sinus rhythm, and the risk of embolic event

If short duration of AFib and low risk of embolic events: Start cardioversion (chemical or electrical)

If long duration of AFib and high risk of embolic events: Do TEE to see if there is atrial thrombus

If +ve atrial thrombus, start anticoagulant therapy until no thrombus

If no, can cardioversion

### CHA2DS2-VAS Score to determine needs of anticoagulation

CHF, HTN, Age>75 (2), DM, Stroke (2), Vascular disease, Age 65-74 (1), Sex (female +1)

### HAS-BLED Score to determine risk of bleeding with anticoagulation
