### Genitofemoral nerve

The Genitofemoral nerve is formed from the anterior rami of L1 and L2, and branches into the femoral branch and genital branch.

- ****************************Femoral branch (L1)****************************
    
    The femoral branch descends and passes under the inguinal ligament, lateral to the femoral artery.
    
    It courses superficially to provide:
    
    - Sensory innervation of the femoral triangle.
- **********************************Genital branch (L2)**********************************
    
    The genital branch passes through the deep inguinal ring into the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Inguinal canal\|Inguinal canal]], accompanying the spermatid cord or round ligament.
    
    It provides:
    
    - In male, it provides sensory innervation to the scrotal skin and motor innervation of the cremaster muscle. [[In males, the genitofemral nerve is involved in the cremasteric reflex\|In males, the genitofemral nerve is involved in the cremasteric reflex]].
    - In female, it provides sensory innervation to the labia majora and mons pubis.
