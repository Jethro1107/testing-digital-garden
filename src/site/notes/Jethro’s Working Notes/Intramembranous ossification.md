### Intramembranous ossification

Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone by direct differentiation of condensed mesenchymal cells into [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteoblast\|Osteoblast]] to secrete osteoid. Unlike endochondral ossification, it does not involve a hyaline cartilage template.

Intramembranous ossification is involved in formation of flat bones in the skull during *************************embryological development*************************.

- **Steps in intramembranous ossification**
    
    Messenchymal cells condense and differentiate into osteoblasts ([[Osteoblast differentiation requires activation of RUNX2\|Osteoblast differentiation requires activation of RUNX2]]), which secrete osteoid.
    
    Osteoid becomes calcified to form matrix, where entrapped osteoblasts become [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Osteocyte\|Osteocyte]]s to maintain the bone batrix.
    
    Surrounding mesenchymal cells becomes the periosteum ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Periosteum and endosteum\|Periosteum and endosteum]]), and differentiate into osteoblast to lay down osteoid to enable appositional growth.
    
    Simutaneously, the calcified bone matrix, which is initially laid down as primary bone tissue, is remodelled into secondary bone tissue ([[Primary bone and secondary bone differ histologically\|Primary bone and secondary bone differ histologically]]), as either compact bone or spongy bone ([[Compact bone and spongy bone differ by the presence of cavities\|Compact bone and spongy bone differ by the presence of cavities]]).
