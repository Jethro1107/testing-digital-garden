### Pancreatic flow rate affects ionic composition of pancreatic juice

When pancreatic flow rate increases, concentration of Na+ and K+ remains the same, but concentration of of Cl- and HCO3- exhibits a reciprocal relationship, i.e. Concentration of Cl- decrease while concentration of HCO3- increases.

This is because when pancreatic flow rate is low, pancreatic juice mainly consist of isotonic fluid containing Na+, Cl- and water ([[Secretion of isotonic fluid by pancreatic acinar cells is driven by an ionic mechanism\|Secretion of isotonic fluid by pancreatic acinar cells is driven by an ionic mechanism]]). 

Pancreatic flow rate increases as there is release of large amounts of bicarbonate fluids by ductal cells, which consist of isotonic fluid containing Na+, HCO3- and water ([[Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids\|Ductal cells are responsible for production of large volumes of isotonic, HCO3- rich fluids]] ).
