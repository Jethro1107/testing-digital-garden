### Clinical Skill - Assessing Clubbing

Pick up patient’s fingers by the sides.

Clubbing can be assessed in 3 ways:

1. Whether there is another abnormal curvature of nail plate.
2. Whether there is obliteration of the lovibond angle.
3. Whether there is any floating sensation when pressing on the base of the nail bed.

### Pathophysiology of clubbing

Clubbing indicates tissue fibrosis/ Deposition of soft tissues beneath the nail plate, while often associated with hypoxia, it isn’t directly caused by hypoxia.

- Infective endocarditis

Respiratory:

- Lung carcinoma
- Chronic pulmonary suppuration (Bronchiectasis, lung abscess, empyema)
