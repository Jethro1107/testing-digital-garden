### Evergreen note-taking is a struggle

Many consider evergreen note-taking as a system, but I see it as a philosophy. A system is something that streamlines a process, in this case, consolidating information and synthesising knowledge. Yet, even an expert of evergreen note-taking would tell you it is the most gruesome part on knowledge work (See [Andy’s notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zVFGpprS64TzmKGNzGxq9FiCDnAnCPwRU5T)). The process is inefficient, notes often takes weeks, months to complete. Even then, it shouldn’t be considered complete. It is evergreen.

Evergreen note creation is the expansion of one’s knowledge put into writing, and based on this fact, the practice will always be a struggle. A struggle to gather, consolidate and synthesise understanding, a struggle to put an idea into one’s own words, a struggle to expand one’s mind. But in this struggle, the essence of a concept is distilled out, crystalised into clarity… The struggle is worth it.

### Reference

‘*As part of my [My daily routine](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3x7AvJgYzmgEY4kcKdSY2aYxdqWYpTyPqRs8), mornings are often spent writing and revising [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C). This is typically the most challenging work I do all day, so I like to do it when I have the most clarity and focus. It’s not for “note-taking” in a traditional sense—writing down other people’s ideas, or recording things that happened—it’s for developing ideas. (i.e. [Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5nw1rPzimCJYyMknDujwvP344Hv3ixCZRZV2) vs. [Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6cFzJWgj9vZpnrQsjrZ8yCNREzCTgyFeVZTb))’*
