### Tetracycline

Tetracycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis. It is bacteriostatic.

- **MOA of tetracycline**
    
    Tetracycline binds to the acceptor site on 30s subunit of ribosome.
    
    This blocks the binding of amino-acyl tRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex.
    
    This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain, thus inhibiting protein synthesis.

- **Derivatives of tetracycline**
    - Doxycycline
        - **Pharmacokinetics of doxycycline**
            
            90-100% oral bioavailability, but absorption reduced to 20% when taken with food.
            
            Eliminated by nonrenal mechanisms (e.g. biliary excretion) - does not require dose adjustment in renal impaired patients.
            
    - Glycylcycline (tigecycline)
        - **Spectrum of tigecycline**
            
            Broad spectrum antibiotics - effective against multi-resistant gram positive bacteria, some gram negative bacteria and anaerobes
            
            Not effective against proteus and pseudomonas species
            
        - **Pharmacokinetics of tigecycline**
            
            Eliminated by biliary excretion
            
    - Eravacycline
        - **Spectrum of eravacycline**
            
            Broad spectrum antibiotics - effective against multi-resistant gram positive bacteria, some gram negative bacteria and anaerobes
            
- **Adverse effects of Tetracyclines**
    - Local tissue irritation (avoid IM injecetion)
    - GI upset
    - Hepatotoxicity (causing jaundice and fatty liver), particularly in pregnant women
    - Permanent teeth discolouration in children
    - Photosensitivity
    - Vestibular problems
    
    Hence, tetracycline is usually avoided in children or during pregnancy.
    
- **Mechanism of tetracycline resistance**
    1. Impaired influx and increased efflux in gram negative bacteria (not tigecycline)
    2. Enzymatic inactivation of tetracycline
    3. Ribosomal protection by expressing proteins that inhibit tetracycline binding
