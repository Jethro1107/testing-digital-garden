### Physiological basis of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy

ORS is a hypo-osmotic solution containing glucose, sodium, chloride, potassium and citrate.

Glucose is essential as it drives Na+ absorption, and hence, water absorption in the small intestines, as [[Absorption of carbohydrates is mediated by by Na+ dependent transport and facilitated diffusion\|Absorption of carbohydrates is mediated by by Na+ dependent transport and facilitated diffusion]].

Potassium and Chloride replaces the loss in diarrhoea.

Citrate serves as an acid buffer to correct base-deficit acidosis.
