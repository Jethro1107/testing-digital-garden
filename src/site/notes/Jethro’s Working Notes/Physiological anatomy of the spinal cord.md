### Physiological anatomy of the spinal cord

The spinal cord is characterised with an inner H-shaped gray matter region, which consist of cell bodies, and an outer white matter region, which consist of the axons.

### The outer white matter region is divided into descending tracts and ascending tracts

Descending tracts provide motor functions, while ascending tracts provide sensory functions.

- ********************************************************************************************************************Descending tract is further separated into 2 tracts********************************************************************************************************************
    
    Descending tract is separated into the:
    
    - Lateral corticospinal tract:
        
        The lateral corticospinal tract consist of axons of upper motor neurons from the primary motor cortex of the precentral gyrus, and serves as a communication from the brain to the lower motor neurons within the anterior horn of the spinal cord, to coordinate voluntary motor functions.
        
        When the cell bodies of the upper motor neurons is stimulated, signals travel down axons in the lateral corticospinal tract, which synapse with the lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, then, signal tranvels via their axons through peripheral nerves to stimulate the fibres.
        
        ************************Organization************************
        
        In general, cervical is more medial, while sacral is most lateral.
        
    - Anterior corticospinal tract
- ****************************************************************************************************Ascending tract is further separated into 3 tracts****************************************************************************************************
    
    Dorsal (posterior column) is responsible for deep sensation, proprioception and vibratory sensation (all contributing to positional sense).
    
    Lateral spinothalamic tract consist of pain pathways and temperature sensation.
    
    Ventral spinothalamic tract is for light touch.
