### Humerus

The humerus forms the bony framework of the arm.

- **Classification of the humerus**
    
    The humerus is a typical long bone, with two expanded ends and a shaft in the middle.
    
- **Proximal end of the humerus**
    
    The proximal end of the humerus consist of the head, a hemi-spherical structure that projects medially and somewhat superiorly into the smaller glenoid fossa of the scapulae.
    
    Immediately below the head is the anatomical neck, a very short constriction below the head, separating the head from the greater and lesser tubercles.
    
    The greater and lesser tubercle lies somewhat laterally to the head. The greater tubercle a more prominent landmark that lies laterally, whereas the lesser tubercle is a less prominent landmark that lies medially.
    
    The greater and lesser tubercle is separated by an intertubercular (bicipital) groove, which passes inferiorly to the anterior surface of the shaft of the humerus. The long head of the bicep brachii courses along the bicipital groove on the humerus.

- **Shaft of the humerus**
    
    On the lateral surface of the humerus, the deltoid tuberosity is present, which serves as the site for the attachment of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Deltoid\|Deltoid]]  muscle.
    
    On the posterior surface of the humerus, the radial groove / spiral grooove is present, which courses medially to laterally. The radial groove carries the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Radial nerve\|Radial nerve]] and the deep [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial artery\|Brachial artery]], both of which access the posterior surface of the humerus via the triangular space.
    
- **Distal end of the humerus**
    
    The distal end of the humerus is separated into the **medial condyle** and the **lateral codyle**. The **capitulum** (wheel-like structure) serves as the articular facet for the lateral condyle, while the **trochlea** (pulley-like structure) serves as the articular facet for the medial condyle.
    
    *The two epicondyles lie adjacent to and somewhat superior to the capitulum and the trochlea.* The **medial epicondyle** is more prominent, whereas the **lateral epicondyle** is less prominent.
    
    Note that the **lateral supracondylar bridge** and **medial suprcodylar bridge** are sharp edges that course up the epicondyles.
    
    Three fossas (depressions) are located superior to the capitulum and the trochlea on the distal end of the humerus:
    
    - The *radial fossa* is located superior to the capitulum on the anterior surface of the humerus.
    - The *coranoid fossa* is located superior to the trochlea on the anterior surface of the humerus.
    - The *olecranon fossa* is located superior to the trochlea on the posterior surface of the humerus.
