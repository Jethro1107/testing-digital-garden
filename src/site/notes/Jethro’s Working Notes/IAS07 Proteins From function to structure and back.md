## Protein Function

- **Learning Outcome**
    
    Describe the many roles of proteins which are important in biomedicine
    
    Explain and illustrate the varied roles of protein through the mechanism of insulin interacting with its receptor
    
- **Range of roles of Proteins**
    1. As a catalyst
    2. Involved in nucleic acid interactions
    3. As a receptor
    4. Provide structure to cells and tissues
    5. Important in immune system
- **Insulin and its Receptor - a closer look**

    Insulin in Action:
    
    Function of Insulin - Increase uptake of glucose into cells. How?
    
    When insulin binds to insulin receptors, there is a change in the conformation of the intracellular domain of the receptor, eventually resulting in the transport of glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the membrane
    
    Insulin essentially increases the number of GLUT4 to the membrane, thus promoting glucose uptake
    
    Glucose is then transported to region for glycogen synthesis

## Amino Acids

- **Learning Outcome**
    
    Classify the amino acids and describe how amino acids act as the building blocks of proteins
    
    Illustrate the enantiomeric nature of amino acids
    
    Apply knowledge of amino acid structure to determine the characteristic of a short peptide
    
- **L-α amino acids as the building blocks of Proteins**
    
    ![[F558C6FD-B2CE-4DDC-9B21-A6ED49ABE460.jpeg\|F558C6FD-B2CE-4DDC-9B21-A6ED49ABE460.jpeg]]
    
    Amino acids are molecules containing both amine and carboxyl functional groups
    
    All proteins are made of L-alpha amino acids
    
    Greek letter indicates the number of carbon atoms between the amino group and carboxyl group (alpha: 1 carbon atom in between)
    
- **Enantiomeric nature of Amino Acids**

    21 proteinogenic acid, 20 classic amino acids
    
    - Non-polar, aliphatic:
        
        Glycine - smallest amino acid, R = H, hence non-enantiomeric
        
        Alanine - R = CH3 group
        
        Proline - Side chain bond to backbone twice, once to central C, once to amino group

        Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine - very hydrophobic, often in the central of the protein due to their chemical nature

        positively-charged - Lysine, Arginine, Histidine (due to the protonation of amino groups)

    Primary Structure:
    
    The sequence of amino acids from N-terminal to C-terminal
    
    Post-translational modifications such as phosphrylation and glycosylation are also considered part of the primary structure
    
    Secondary structure:
    
    The local conformation of the backbone due to interactions of atoms in the backbone, not interaction between sidechain atoms
    
    Alpha helix:
    
    Right-hand helix
    
    Stabilised by H-bonds between oxygen of carboxyl group of an amino acid and hydrogen of amine group 4 amino acids downstream, distance of the two interacting amino acids results in the helical structure
    
    3.6 amino acids and 5.4Å per turn
    
    side chains stick out, which determines different properties of the alpha helix
    
    Beta Sheet:
    
    Involves two or more beta strands
    
    Stabalised by H-bonds between oxygen and hydrogen atom of 2 different beta chains
    
    Pleated structure ( angled up and down between planes)

    Parallel and antiparallel
    
    Tertiary Structure:
    
    The overall three dimensional structure due to the interaction between amino acid side chains
    
    These interactions include H-bonds, VDW forces, and other electrostatic interactions 
    
    Quaternary Structure:
    
    When more than one polypetide chain (subunit) comes together to form the final functional structure
