### Infective esophagitis

- **Etiology of infective esophagitis**
    
    Fungal esophagitis - Candida, Aspergillus, Mucor infections
    
    Viral esophagitis - Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)
    
- **Gross pathology of esophagus revealed in endoscopy may not reveal infective cause. Biopsy and histological confirmation can aid diagnosis of etiology. For example:**
    
    Herpes simplex virus may cause cells to become multinucleated.
