### Carpal tunnel

The carpal tunnel is *an anatomical space in the wrist* that is formed by the **base of the carpal arch** (carpal bones, marked by the tubercles of scaphoid and trapezium on the radial side, and the pisiform and hook of halmate on the ulnar side), and the **flexor retinaculum.**

The flexor retinaculum is a specialised deep fascia that connects the edges of the base of the carpal arch and converts the carpal arch into a carpal tunnel.

- **************************************************************Structures of the carpal tunnel**************************************************************
    
    The carpal tunnel consist of the tendons of the ********************************flexor digitorum superficialis******************************** and the tendons of the *************************************flexor digitorum profundus deep to it*************************************. 
    
    The tendon of the flexor pollicus longus lies lateral to the other tendons.
    
    The median  nerve lies anterior of these tendons, and is often involved in [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Carpal tunnel syndrome\|Carpal tunnel syndrome]].
    
    ****************************************However, the carpal tunnel is avascular.****************************************

The flexor retinaculum presses the tendons to the bony plane, preventing bow-stringing of the tendons.

However, not all structures in the wrist are enclosed in the carpal tunnel, the radial and ulnar artery lie lateral and medial to the carpal tunnel, as well as the extensor tendons on the dorsal side of the wrist.
