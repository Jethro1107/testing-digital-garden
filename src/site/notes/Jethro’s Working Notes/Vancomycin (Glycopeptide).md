### Vancomycin

Vancomycin is a Glycopeptide (non-beta-lactam) antibiotic. It is bactericidal. There is little vancomycin resistant bacteria.

- **MOA of Vancomycin**
    
    Vancomycin works by occupying D-alanine-D-alanine portion of the tetrapeptide sequence of NAM, thus preventing formation of amino acid cross link to hold glycan layers together.
    
    This inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis, causing it to be susceptible to osmotic pressure, resulting in cell lysis.

- **Usage of Vancomycin**
    
    Vancomycin is usually preserved for serious infections in penicillin-allergic patients, and especially used in drug-resistant bacteria (e.g. MRSA, MRSE).
    
    Oral vancomycin is also first-line treatment for [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Clostridium difficile colitis\|Clostridium difficile colitis]].
    
- **Adverse effects of Vancomycin**
    
    Rapid IV infusion can cause:
    
    - Increased incidence of pain and thrombophlebitis
    - Flushing (red man syndrome)
    
    Hence, A slow IV infusion is required.
    
    Other adverse effects include:
    
    - Nephrotoxicity
    - Ototoxicity
    
    Note that vancomycin undergoes renal elimination, and thus dosage must be adjusted in renal failure.
