### Osteoarthritis

- **What is osteoarthritis?**
    
    Osteoarthritis refers to the **progressive loss of articular cartilage**, accompanied with the attempted repair of cartilage, remodelling, and *sclerosis of subchondral bone, subchondral cyst formation and marginal osteophytes*.
    
    Osteoarthritis is a *common, age-related, heterogenous group of disorders* characterised pathologically by the loss of articular cartilage in synovial joints, associated with variable degrees of osteophyte formation, subchondral bone changes and synovitis.
    
- **Classification of osteoarthritis by etiology**
    
    Osteoarthritis can be classified into primary (idiopathic) osteoarthritis and secondary osteoarthritis. 
    
    Most cases of osteoarthritis are primary osteoarthritis, which occurs insidiously, with no apparent initial cause (predisposing factor), and is usually considered as an *ageing phenomenon*.
    
    - Common joints involved in primary osteoarthritis are the hip and knee joints, DIP joint of the hand (Herberden’s nodes). Other possible synovial joints include: CMC joint of the thumb, metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe, facet joints of the spine, elbow joint and shoulder joint.
    
    Secondary osteoarthritis usually occurs in a younger population with apparent predisposing factors ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Epidemiology and risk factors of Osteoarthritis\|Epidemiology and risk factors of Osteoarthritis]]).
    
- **Pathoanatomy of osteoarthritis**
    
    Osteoarthritis is characterised pathologically with:
    
    1. Loss of articular cartilage, which can be classified into 5 grades:
        
        Grade 0 - Appears to be normal cartilage, with smooth surface and a glistening white appearance.
        
        Grade 1 - Articular cartilage appears to be soft (when probing it on arthroscopy) and swollen.
        
        Grade 2 - Cartilage consist of partial-thickness defects, with fibrillation or fissures.
        
        Grade 3 - Cartilage consist of increased amount of damage to the subchondral bone.
        
        Grade 4 - Eburnation, or exposure of the subchondral bone is seen.

    2. Marginal osteophyte formation - Bony formations at the rim of the joints as a physiological response to increase articular area (ineffective). Marginal osteophytes underlie stiffness.

    3. Subchondral bone stenosis - An increase in bone density, but the bone also becomes more brittle.
    4. Subchondral cyst formation - When subchondral bone cracks, fluid enters to form cysts.

        Coincidentally, some of these are actually radiological features used in the [[Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of osteoarthritis\|Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of osteoarthritis]]. Loss of articular cartilage, indirectly is also part of the classification system, as the *********************joint space narrowing*********************, as cartilage (soft tissue) is not visualised on plain X-Ray, such that it manifests as loss of joint space radiographically.
        
- **Clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis**
    
    EULAR defines the 3 signs and symptoms for clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis:
    
    - 3 symptoms: Persistent pain, limited morning stiffness, reduced function
    - 3 signs: Crepitus, Bony enlargement, Reduced range of motion
    
    It should be noted that absence of signs of inflammation, i.e. no redness or warmth, is important in diagnosis of osteoarthritis ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clinical approach to joint pain\|Clinical approach to joint pain]]).

    Straightforward osteoarthritis can be diagnosed with the characteristic signs and symptoms, but if the diagnosis is unclear, or if other differential diagnosis should be considered, other investigations should be performed.
    
- **Investigations of osteoarthritis**
    
    *Imaging.* Often, Plain radiographs is sufficient, while other imaging modalities such as MRI is reserved for associated pathologies (e.g. Meniscal tear, loose bodies, Baker’s cyst). The [[Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of osteoarthritis\|Kellgren and Lawrence system for classification of osteoarthritis]] is used for assessment of osteoarthritis.
    
    *Blood tests.* Blood tests are usually used to rule out other pathologies in atypical presentations of OA (e.g. inflammatory joint disorders and infective arthritis). Useful blood tests include:
    
    - CBC - white cell counts
    - ESR, CRP
    - Bone profiles (Calcium, Phosphate, Alkaline phosphatase)
    - Serum uric acid
    - Relevant serological tests
    
    *Joint aspiration.* Joint aspiration is only performed if other differentials are suspected, usually to rule out infective/septic arthritis and gout/pseudogout:
    
    - Synovial fluid should have clear straw colour
    - Total cell count is low (<1000/mm3)
    - Gram smear and culture for infective agents is negative
    - Crystals is negative
- **Management of osteoarthritis**
    
    Physical therapy - Exercise is the single most important component in the management of osteoarthritis.
    
    Pharmacological treatment - [[Paracetamol [[(Acetaminophen)\|Paracetamol [[(Acetaminophen)]]]], [[Jethro’s Working Notes/NSAID\|NSAID]] or [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Selective COX-2 inhibitors\|Selective COX-2 inhibitors]], Anticonvulsants, Antidepressants
    
    Cartilage supplements - Glucosamine (lack of level I evidence)
    
    Intra-articular injection - Hyaluronate, Steroid
    
    Surgery - Arthroscopy (removal of loose bodies, repairing meniscal tears), Realignment osteotomy, Joint replacement
