### Crypts of Lieburkuhn

Crypts of Lieburkuhn are short tubular glands formed from the invagination of the simple columnar epithelium between [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intestinal villi\|Intestinal villi]] into the lamina propria.

- **Cell types in the Crypts of Lieburkuhn**
    
    Enterocytes - Absorptive cells that consist of brush border of microvilli
    
    Goblet cells - Mucous secreting cells
    
    Paneth cells:
    
    - Paneth cells are located at the base of the crypt.
    - Histologically, paneth cells assume the appearance of protein-secreting cells, with apical eosinophilic granules (containing defensin).

    - They serve defensive functions by secreting defensin.
    
    Enteroendocrine cells:
    
    - Enteroendocrine cells are located at the base of the crypt.
    - Histologically, they consist of subnuclear eosinophilic granules.

    - They serve endocrine/paracrine functions, involved in regulating GI motility and secretion.
