### Say Grace to Tea denotes the goose feet

*A mnemonic.* It refers to the insertion of 3 muscles just below the medial condyle of the tibia: **Anteriorly, the insertion of the Sartorius, in the middle, the insertion of the Gracilis, and posteriorly, the insertion of the Semitendinous.** The arrangement of insertions from anterior to posterior makes sense, as the first is part of the anterior compartment of the thigh, the second is from the medial compartment of the thigh, the third is part of the posterior compartment of the thigh.

The insertions apparently looks like a goose feet, or *******************pes anserinus in Latin*******************.
