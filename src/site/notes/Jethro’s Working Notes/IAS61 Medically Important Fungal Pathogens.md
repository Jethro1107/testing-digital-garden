### Microbiology of Fungi

- Describe the mycology of fungi?
    
    Fungi are eukaryotes
    
    Their cell walls consist of:
    
    60% glucan - beta-1,6-glucan and beta-1,3-glucan
    
    30% protein
    
    10% chitin
    
    Cell membrane consist of ergosterol

- How is fungi classified?
    
    Yeast - Unicellular, 5 micron in diameter, and reproduces by budding
    
    Moulds - Multicellular, consisting of long branching filaments called hyphae (2-5 microns wide), which matter into mycelium, reproduce by spores, produced by sporulating structures at the end of hyphae
    
    Dimorphic fungi â€” Yeast at body temperature, mould at room tempearture
    
- Give examples of medically important yeast.
    
    Candida albicans
    
    Cryptococcus neoformans (thick capsule)
    
- Give examples of medically important moulds.
    
    Aspergillus fumigatus - Spores invade lungs
    
    Dermatophytes (Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, Microsporum) - Tinea infections
    
- Give examples of medically important diorphic fungi.
    
    Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei
    

### Epidemiology of Fungi

- How are different fungi distributed geographically?
    
    Globally:
    
    Candida
    
    Dermatophytes
    
    Aspergillus
    
    Local:
    
    Telaromyces marneffei
    
    Dimorphic fungi
    
- What are the risks factors for fungal infections?
    
    Weakened immune system would pose a risk for fungal infections as fungi are opportunistic pathogens:
    
    Neutropenia (risk factor for Aspergillus infection)
    
    HIV infection (risk factor for C. neoformans and T. marneffei infections)
    

### Clinical Diseases caused by Fungi

- What are the different diseases caused by superficial infections?
    
    Superficial candidiasis - Oral flush, vaginal flush
    
    Dermatophytosis - Tinea pedis, tinea capitum, tinea unguium
    
    Mycetoma
    
    Invasive aspergillosis
    
- In what patients will systemic fungal infections occur?
    
    In immunocomprimised host as fungi are oppurtunistic pathogens (C. neoformans, A. fumigatus, T. marneffei)
    
    Systemic candidiasis
    

### Laboratory Diagnosis of Fungi

- How are  different fungal infections diagnosed in a laboratory?
    
    Detection of Fungus or its components:
    
    Direct Visualization:
    
    KOH smear - moulds
    
    Gram smear - Candida
    
    Indian ink smear - Cryptococcus neoformans
    
    Biopsy and histopathology
    
    Antigen detection:
    
    beta-D-glucan
    
    Cryptococcus neoformans: Capsular polysaccharides
    
    Aspergillus: galactomannan
    
    Nucleic acid detection:
    
    Asperigillus
    
    Detection of patients response:
    
    Antibody detection - T. marneffei
    
    Biopsy and histopathology, observing for host response
    

### Treatment of Fungal Infections

- How are anti-fungal agents classified by their actions? Give examples.
    
    Action on cell membrane:
    
    Polyenes - Complexes with ergosterol, disrupting plasma membrane (Nystatin, amphortericin B)
    
    Azoles - Inhibit ergsterol synthesis (Fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole)
    
    Nucleoside analogues - Inhibit DNA synthesis (5-flycytosine)
    
    Cell wall synthesis inhibitors
    
    Echinocandins (Caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin)
    
- Is anti-fungal susceptibility testing required?
    
    No.
    
    Proper identification of the fungus is essential to guide treatment
    
    By properly identifying the fungus, a specific anti-fungal agent can be used
    

### Candida albicans

- What type of fungi do Candida albicans belong to?
    
    Yeast
    
- What are the medically important species of Candida?
    
    C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. krusei
    
- Describe the epidemeology of Candida albicans.
    
    Reservoir:
    
    Normal commensals of human, in GI tract, skin, and female genital traction
    
    Present globally
    
    Risk factors:
    
    Anything that weakens immune system
    
    Broad spectrum antibiotics - Provides selective pressure, enables overgrowth of C. albicans
    
    Hospitalization
    
    IV lines
    
    HIV
    
    Neutropenia
    
    Transplant
    
    Steroids
    
- What are the different clinical diseases caused by Candida albicans infection?
    
    Immunocompetent host:
    
    Vaginal thrush
    
    Immunocomprimised host:
    
    Refractory superficial infections (Oral thrush, mucocutaneous candidiasis)
    
    Systemic candidiasis (Candidemia, Disseminated infections like hepatosplenic candidiasis)
    
- How is Candida albicans diagnosed?
    
    Direct visualization:
    
    Gram smear
    
    Culture:
    
    Agar plate, Broth culture, germ tube formation in serum, biochemical tests
    
    Antigen detection:
    
    detect for beta-D-glycan
    
- How is Superficial Candidiasis treated?
    
    Topical treatment -Nystatin
    
    In refractory cases provide systemic treatment, like oral fluconazole
    
- How is systemic candidiasis treated?
    
    Systemic treatment
    
    Oral/IV fluconazole, amphotericin B
    
- How is Candida albicans infection prevented?
    
    Avoid antibiotic overuse to prevent overgrowth
    
    Fluconazole prophylaxis for transplant recipients
