### [Cardiac Output](https://www.remnote.com/doc/XciFjR6i4tmNdMsRk)

- **Definition and calculation of Cardiac Output**
    - [Cardiac Output](https://www.remnote.com/doc/XciFjR6i4tmNdMsRk) refers to the minute volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle
    - [Cardiac Output](https://www.remnote.com/doc/XciFjR6i4tmNdMsRk) = heart rate (beats per minute) x stroke volume (mL per beat)
- **Calculation of stroke volume**
    - Stroke volume = end-diastolic volume - end-systolic volume

### Regulation of heart rate

- Intrinsic control of heart rate
    - **Origin of a heart beat (cardiac muscle contraction)**
        - Originates from the intrinsic initiation and conduction of action potentials of pacemaker cells in the cardiac conduction system
    
    - Ionic basis of electrical activity of myocardial pacemaker cells (conducting cells)
        - **Difference in resting potential between myocardial pacemaker cells and neurons/skeletal muscle cells**
            - Myocardial pacemaker cells do not have a stable resting potential, rather they have an unstable or drifting resting potential called the pacemaker potential, allowing for self-excitation
        - **Mechanism of automatic rhythmicity of action potential generation of pacemaker cells**
            - Automatic rhythmicity of self-excitation (action potential generation) by pacemaker cells can be divided into 3 phase:
                - Spontaneous depolarization to threshold (Phase 4) - Slow influx of Na+ into pacemaker cells via funny channels (open from -60mV to -40mV) form the funny current, which gradually raises membrane potential, T-type Ca2+ channels also open, resulting in an inward Ca2+ current that serve as a final depolarizing boost to pacemaker potential until membrane potential reaches threshold at -40 mV, that is when funny channels and T-type Ca2+ channels close
                - Rapid depolarization (Phase 0) - When threshold of -40 mV is met, L-type Ca2+ channels open, causing rapid influx of Ca2+ ions forming the inward calcium current, depolarizing the membrane to +5 mV
                - Repolarization (Phase 3) - When membrane potential reaches +5 mV, Ca2+ channels become inactivated and K+ channels open, such that the influx of Ca2+ ceases and K+ diffuses out of the cell forming the outward pottasium current, repolarizing the membrane to -60 mV
                - At -60 mV, K+ channels close and funny channels open, resulting in spontaneous depolarization again

    - Intrinsic control of the heart's rhythmicity in cardiac conduction system
        - **The Normal Pacemaker of the Heart**
            - The SA node is the normal pacemaker of the heart, controlling heart rate
            - **Reason for SA node for being normal pacemaker of the heart**
                - Pacemaker activity of SA node is considerably faster than that of AV node, Bundle of His and Purkinje fibres
                - Everytime the SA node generates an action potential, it is depolarizes the AV node and Purkinje fibres, causing them to fire action potentials
                - The SA node fires an action potential again before the membrane potential of either the AV node or purkinje fibres reaches the threshold for action potential generation, and hence the action potential of the SA node depolarizes the AV node and Purkinje fibres to threshold before self-excitation can occur in either of these sites

        - [Ectopic Pacemaker](https://www.remnote.com/doc/Gco74B7gmtXsGpuNM) of the heart
            - **What happens if SA node fails?**
                - AV node, which has the second highest pacemaker activity assumes intrinsic control of the heart rate
- Extrinsic regulation of heart rate
    - Parasympathetic activity on heart rate
        - **Effects of parasympathetic stimulation on heart rate**
            - Parasympathetic (vagal stimulation) slows down heart rate, resulting in negative chronotropy
        - **Mechanism of vagal effects on heart rate**
            - Acetylcholine binds to M2 muscarinic receptors on pacemaker cells, which:
                - Decreases rate of spontaneous (diastolic) depolarization:
                    - Inhibits the inward funny current, decreasing the rate of spontaneous depolarization
                    - Inhibit the inward calcium current, decreasing th rate of spontaneous depolarization
                    
                    ![https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/6gZoOlzjDTJl_Xhd91MwRFEdNoch7yDBNx-Mt3piMFvt2VHbxVp6mJFfOp2SQOshyIkG4dpLkz7903eeqZpE5azdkwDIIlZFbRVS6mIwq1KbQRfT71mptfoSm6kA0K4w.png](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/6gZoOlzjDTJl_Xhd91MwRFEdNoch7yDBNx-Mt3piMFvt2VHbxVp6mJFfOp2SQOshyIkG4dpLkz7903eeqZpE5azdkwDIIlZFbRVS6mIwq1KbQRfT71mptfoSm6kA0K4w.png)
                    
                - Makes the maximum diastolic potential more negative:
                    - Opening of G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels, which hyperpolarizes the membrane, resulting in a more negative maximum diastolic potentia
                    
                    ![https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/wMxc384ghh9jO1UKCkFj9f-hdoEGA6b7kR-fmP0qQ1Jf27O8bn7PxH4BqUTZtnr5k5fZ74y69YLB3RqlVHZrg5u7POKJyjeaL9BdujPVQwP_5mIBCpFf7YDktDoroq3n.png](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/wMxc384ghh9jO1UKCkFj9f-hdoEGA6b7kR-fmP0qQ1Jf27O8bn7PxH4BqUTZtnr5k5fZ74y69YLB3RqlVHZrg5u7POKJyjeaL9BdujPVQwP_5mIBCpFf7YDktDoroq3n.png)
                    
                - Increases the threshold for action potential:
                    - Inhibition of inward calcium current also raises the threshold for action potential
                    
                    ![https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/iZklkNlZJutSR_DlSLz6r2fgq0qaW77DAB9bVV09Oi7MRg4VTzbaLbK50WP_-Z9v3-RfgPufnux0VWorQvbwbh9BzV5kDVpxvTBtM4y7AiYNTWkQPf1DDvia4dHrHyU8.png](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/iZklkNlZJutSR_DlSLz6r2fgq0qaW77DAB9bVV09Oi7MRg4VTzbaLbK50WP_-Z9v3-RfgPufnux0VWorQvbwbh9BzV5kDVpxvTBtM4y7AiYNTWkQPf1DDvia4dHrHyU8.png)
                    
            - ACh increases the time for membrane potential to reach threshold to generate an action potential, thus decreasing the rate of rhythmicity of SA node, and slows down conduction velocity of AV node, Bundle of His and Purkinje fibres (by increasing the threshold for action potential generation), which prolongs diastole and thus slows down heart rate
    - Sympathetic activity on heart rate
        - **Effects of sympathetic stimulation on heart rate**
            - Sympathetic stimulation speeds up heart rate, resulting in positve chronotropy
        - **Mechanism of sympathetic effects on heart rate**
            - Norepinephrine binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors of pacemaker cells, which:
                - Increases the rate of spontaneous depolarization:
                    - Increase the inward funny current, increasing the rate of spontaneous depolarization
                    - Increase the inward calcium current, increasing the rate of spontaneous depolarization
                        
                        ![https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/CUO2DLf9CanhrTaudXGfHoPbJ9_33mJxFh1g07BocNDa3XrXIW771inFw1C980Zmhs0H5Q_wg82MYIMVFhuNZMsCZBY-ERApOMglEwXtP6d79ZuG6RD8WVHbqQounqCB.png](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/CUO2DLf9CanhrTaudXGfHoPbJ9_33mJxFh1g07BocNDa3XrXIW771inFw1C980Zmhs0H5Q_wg82MYIMVFhuNZMsCZBY-ERApOMglEwXtP6d79ZuG6RD8WVHbqQounqCB.png)
                        
                - Lowering the threshold for action potential:
                    - Increase in inward calcium current also lowers the threshold for action potential
                        
                        ![https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/rROzqzm0jChTDoMjHWkvHND0qUVEN111gCcZQ2ZlhvCFmWjSu9Jh8wVzE1yUcutlGaAe_KkEmz87J4_pEXGuh6ReBKUt1jcAcO_hBmYUW08jBKAtfJ3G_LG_NCG4WeDI.png](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/rROzqzm0jChTDoMjHWkvHND0qUVEN111gCcZQ2ZlhvCFmWjSu9Jh8wVzE1yUcutlGaAe_KkEmz87J4_pEXGuh6ReBKUt1jcAcO_hBmYUW08jBKAtfJ3G_LG_NCG4WeDI.png)
                        
                - Norepinephrine decreases the time for membrane potential to reach threshold to generate an action potential, thus increasing the rate of rhythmicity of SA node, and speeds up the conduction velocity of AV node, Bundle of His and Purkinje fibres (by lowering the threshold of action potential), which shortens diastole and thus increases heart rate
            - Norepinephrine also target cardiac contractile cells, which:
                - Increase the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from troponin C
                - Increase the rate of sequesteration of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum by SERCA2a
                - This shortens systole and speeds up relaxation (lusitrophic effect)
            - Diastole and systole is shortened, and hence heart rate increases

### Regulation of stroke volume

- Cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation
    
    
    - Excitation-contraction coupling
        - **Excitation-contraction coupling definition**
            - The process in which an action potential results in contraction of myocardial contractile cells
        - **Mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling**
            - Action potential spread to interior of cell via T-tubules
            - Influx of Ca2+ via L-type Ca2+ channels during plateau results in calcium-initiated-calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum by Ryanodine receptors
            - Ca2+ binds to troponin C to trigger contractile cycle
    
    - **Relaxation of cardiac muscles**
        - Prevent Ca2+ entry into sarcoplasm:
            - Inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels causes the inward Ca2+ current to arrest, which abolishes the CICR trigger, such that no Ca2+ is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum
        - Remove sarcoplasmic Ca2+ (reduce sarcoplasmic Ca2+ levels to prevent next contraction from becoming stronger):
            - Sequesteration of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum via Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a)
            - Ca2+ shuttled out of cells via action of 2 channels, Ca2+-Na+ exchanger, Ca2+-ATPase
        - As a result, Ca2+ unbinds from troponin and tropomyosin re-covers the actin binding site

- [Pressure-volume loop](https://www.remnote.com/doc/ngG3oCZF2rnX3aZvN)
- Preload
    - **Definition of preload**
        - Preload refers to the initial stretching of cardiac muscles before contraction
        - It directly relates to initial sarcomere length and end-diastolic volume
    - **Frank-Staring mechanism of effects of increased preload on stroke volume**
        - Increase in preload results in an increase in initial sarcomere length, such that it results in an increase in contractile force, and thus increase in stroke volume
    - **Molecular events of effects of preload on stroke volume**
        - Preload (Stretching of cardiac muscles) resulting in increased initial sarcomere length facilitates cross-bridge formation between actin and myosin filaments, but unlike in skeletal muscles, it is not likely to be due to the optimal overlapping of actin and myosin
        - It is due to the increase of Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilaments
        - Also, stretching activates stretch-activated Ca2+ channels, triggering CICR by sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a higher sarcoplasmic concentration of Ca2+ and a greater contractile force
    - **Factors affecting ventricular preload**
        - Venous pressure
            - Increase in venous return cause an increase in preload
        - Inflow resistance
            - Decrease in inflow resistance increases ventricular filling, causing an increase in preload
        - Ventricular inotropy
            - Decrease in ventricular inotropy (decrease in ventricular contraction) results in higher end systolic volume, thus raising end diastolic volume and thus causing an increase in preload
        - Outflow resistance and afterload
            - Increase in afterload causes an increase in end systolic volume, thus raising end diastolic volume and causing an increase in preload
        - Atrial inotropy
            - Increase in atrial inotropy results in increase in ventricular filling, causing increase in end-diastolic volume, and thus an increase in preload
        - Ventricular compliance
            - Increase in ventricular compliance (ability to be stretched) results in an increase in preload
- Afterload
    - **Definition of afterload**
        - Afterload refers to the force opposing the ejection of blood from left ventricle
        - Afterload relates with the aortic pressure
    - **Effects of increased afterload on stroke volume**
        - When afterload increases, it impedes the ejection of blood from left ventricle, resulting in a decrease in stroke volume and increase in end-systolic volume
- Inotropy
    - **What is inotropy?**
        - Inotropy refers to the myocardial contractility independent of preload and afterload
        - Inotropy relates the the velocity of muscle shortening
    - **Effects of positive inotropy on stroke volume**
        - Positive inotropy (increased inotropy) increases the velocity of muscle shortening, resulting in an increase in stroke volume and decrease in end-systolic volume
    - Regulation of inotropy
        - Parasympathetic activity on inotropy (minor effect on inotropy)
        - Sympathetic activity on inotropy
            - **Effects of sympathetic stimulation on inotropy**
                - Sympathetic stimulation results in positive inotropy (increased contractility)
            - **Mechanisms of sympathetic effects on inotropy**
                - Catacholamines binds to beta-1 receptors on cardiomyocytes, which:
                    - Phosphorylate and activate L-type Ca2+ channels, increasing influx of Ca2+, causing increase in intracellular [Ca2+]
                    - Phosphorylate and activate Ryanodine channels, increasing release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing increase in intracellular [Ca2+]
                    - Phosphorylate phospholamban, increasing SERCA2a activity, increasing sequesteration of Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum during diastole, increasing SR Ca2+ store, and increasing CICR and thus intracellular [Ca2+] on next contraction
                - This results in increased intracellualar [Ca2+], resulting in positive inotropy
        - Inotropic effects of heart rate
            - **Effects on heart rate on inotropy (name of phenomenon)**
                - Staircase phenomenon - increase in heart rate results in positive inotropy
            - **Mechanism of effects of heart rate on inotropy**
                - Increase in frequency of action potential, resulting in increased influx of Ca2+ via L-type Ca2+ channels during plateau period, and increased CICR from SR
                - Increase in heart rate also increase sequesteration of Ca2+ into SR via SERCA2a
                - This results in an increase in SR Ca2+ store, and increase in CICR and thus intracellular [Ca2+] on next contraction, resulting in positive inotropy

### Interdependence between preload, afterload and inotropy

- **Effects of increased preload on stroke volume in the context of all regulatory mechanisms**
    - Increased preload results in increased stroke volume, resulting in an increase Cardiac Output and increase in arterial pressure
    - The increase in arterial pressure results in increased afterload, which impedes ventricular ejection, resulting in slight increase in end systolic volume, causing a decrease in stroke volume
    - The net effect is a slight increase in stroke volume
- **Effects of increased afterload on stroke volume in the context of all regulatory mechanisms**
    - Increased afterload results in a decrease in stroke volume, and an increase in end systolic volume
    - This results in an increase in end diastolic volume, causing an increase in preload
    - Increase in preload results in an increase in contractile force, and hence an increase in stroke volume
    - The net effect is a slight decrease in stroke volume
- **Effects of positive inotropy on stroke volume in the context of all regulatory mechanisms**
    - Positve inotropy results in an increase in an increase in stroke volume, resulting in decreased end systolic volume and hence decreased end diastolic volume
    - Increase in stroke volume results in increased [Cardiac Output](https://www.remnote.com/doc/XciFjR6i4tmNdMsRk), and hence increased arterial pressure, and increased afterload
    - Increased afterload causes an increase in end systolic volume, and thus increase in end diastolic volume and increased preload
    - The net effect is increased stroke volume, accompanied with decrease in end systolic volume and smaller decrease in end diastolic volume
