### Physiology of cardiac muscles

- General anatomy of the heart
    - Heart
        - **Layers of the wall of the heart**
            - Endocardium - innermost layer, lined with simple squamous endothelial cells
            - Myocardium - thicknest layer which constitutes most of the mass, made of cardiac muscles
            - Epicardium (Visceral pericardium) - outermost layer, made of connective tissue with coronary arteries, with an overlying serous membrane (made of mesothelial cells)
    - Pericardium
        - **What is the pericardium?**
            - The pericardium is a double-layed fibroserous sac surrounding the heart
        - **Layers of the pericardium**
            - Fibrous pericardium
                - **What is the fibrous pericardium?**
                    - Fibrous pericardium is a tough connective tissue that is attached onto the parietal layer of the serous pericardium, defining the boundaries of the middle mediastinum
                    - The [Fibrous pericardium](https://www.remnote.com/doc/PsxyunxbJcWpXRsXb) (Gray's explanation) is a cone-shaped bag with its base on the diaphragm and its apex continuous with the the adventitia of the great vessels
            - Serous pericardium
                - **Two layers of the serous pericardium and their location of continuity**
                    - Parietal pericardium - lines the inner surface of the fibrous pericardium
                    - Visceral pericardium (epicardium) - lines the heart, forming the outer covering of the heart
                    - The two layers of serous pericardium are continuous at the roots of the great vessels
        - **Functions of the pericardium**
            - Fix the heart in place, preventing the heart from sliding during contraction
            - Prevent cardiac distention/excess filling of the heart (limit the size of the heart)
            - Visceral and fibrous pericardium release serous fluid into pericardial cavity, which acts as lubricant to reduce friction during contraction
            - Prevent infection
- Cardiac muscles: Structure and contraction
    - **Two types of cardiomyocytes**
        - Myocardial conducting (pacemaker) cells - constitute the cardiac conduction system, able to generate action potential on their own (unable to generate contractile force)
        - Myocardial contractile cells - constitute the bulk of cells in the heart, responsible for generating contractile force to pump the heart (unable to generate action potential on their own)

    - Cardiac muscles as a syncytium
        - **Why is cardiac muscle described as a syncytium?**
            - Cardiac muscles constitute of many cardiac muscle cells interconnected via intercalated disk, forming an electrical and mechanical syncytium
        - **Importance of cardiac muscles as a syncytium**
            - Electrical connection - Intercalated disks consist of gap junctions that permit a single action potential produced by a pacemaker cell to propagate throughout the heart, allowing the heart to contract in a synchronized and wave-like manner
            - Mechanical connection - Intercalated disks consist of desmosomes that form strong cell-cell adhesions via cadherin, holding cardiac muscle cells together during contraction
    - Basic contractile unit of cardiomyocytes
        - **Basic contractile unit and its components**
            - Sarcomere is the basic contractile unit of cardiomyocytes, composed of:
                - Thin filaments - troponin complex, tropomyosin and actin
                - Thick filament - myosin
            - Troponin complex
                - **Function of troponin complex**
                    - Determine the availability of actin binding site for myosin head
                - **Components of troponin complex**
                    - Troponin T (TnT) - for tropomyosin binding
                    - Troponin C (TnC) - for calcium binding
                    - Troponin I (TnI) - for inhibiting myosin head binding with tropomyosin
                    
                    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
                    
                - **Action of troponin complex in contractile cycle**
                    - Upon binding of Ca2+ to TnC, it results in the structural change of tropomyosin-actin filament which exposes the actin binding site, resulting in actin-myosin interaction and shortening of sarcomere (i.e. contraction) via sliding filament mechanism
    - **Organization of cardiac muscles tissues relating to function**
        - Cardiac muscle tissues are arranched in circular and spiral arrangements such that they contract via a twisting, wringing motion, in order to have proper direction of squeezing of blood, increasing efficiency to pump blood out of heart chambers

### Electrical activity of the heart

- Cardiac conduction system
    - **Cardiac conduction system and its function**
        - The cardiac conduction system is made of a network of myocardial conducting cells that initiate and conduct electrical impulses locally, ensuring that the contraction of the four heart chambers are coordinated with each other
    - Components of the cardiac conduction system
        - [Sinu-atrial node](https://www.remnote.com/doc/SZq8Q9Xx2dbmoCz9D)
        - [Atrioventricular node](https://www.remnote.com/doc/XEL9rsBY7zFhW5Suh)
        - [Atrioventricular bundle](https://www.remnote.com/doc/YemAsuhjx992mm8u4) - Bundle of His and bundle branches
        - Purkinje fibres

- Ionic basis of electrical activity of myocardial pacemaker cells (conducting cells)
    - **Difference in resting potential between myocardial pacemaker cells and neurons/skeletal muscle cells**
        - Myocardial pacemaker cells do not have a stable resting potential, rather they have an unstable or drifting resting potential called the pacemaker potential, allowing for self-excitation
    - **Mechanism of automatic rhythmicity of action potential generation of pacemaker cells**
        - Automatic rhythmicity of self-excitation (action potential generation) by pacemaker cells can be divided into 3 phase:
            - Spontaneous depolarization to threshold (Phase 4) - Slow influx of Na+ into pacemaker cells via funny channels (open from -60mV to -40mV) form the funny current, which gradually raises membrane potential, T-type Ca2+ channels also open, resulting in an inward Ca2+ current that serve as a final depolarizing boost to pacemaker potential until membrane potential reaches threshold at -40 mV, that is when funny channels and T-type Ca2+ channels close
            - Rapid depolarization (Phase 0) - When threshold of -40 mV is met, L-type Ca2+ channels open, causing rapid influx of Ca2+ ions forming the inward calcium current, depolarizing the membrane to +5 mV
            - Repolarization (Phase 3) - When membrane potential reaches +5 mV, Ca2+ channels become inactivated and K+ channels open, such that the influx of Ca2+ ceases and K+ diffuses out of the cell forming the outward pottasium current, repolarizing the membrane to -60 mV
            - At -60 mV, K+ channels close and funny channels open, resulting in spontaneous depolarization again
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
- Electrical activity of myocardial contractile cells
    - **Resting potential of myocardial contractile cells**
        - Myocardial contractile cells have a stable resting membrane potential at -85 mV - -90 mV, until arrival of action potential from an adjacent cell
    - **Ionic basis of action potential of myocardial contractile cells**
        - Action potential of myocardial contractile cells can be divided into 5 phases:
            - Rapid depolarization - Opening of Na+ channels depolarizes the membrane from +30 mV
            - Brief repolarization - Inactivation of Na+ channel and opening of transient K+ channel, result in K+ diffusing out of the cell, forming the transient outward K+ current, briefly repolarizing the cell
            - Plateau - L-type Ca2+ channels open results in the inward flow of Ca2+ ions and forming the inward Ca2+ current, counterbalancing the outward K+ current, such that membrane remains depolarized at a plateau of 0 mV
            - Repolarization - L-type Ca2+ channels are inactivated, and Ca2+ activated K+ channels (delayed rectifier channels) open, resulting in an outward K+ current that repolarizes the membrane
            - Resting potential - Repolarization via inward K+ channel repolarizes membrane to resting potential of -90mV

- Comparison of myocardial pacemaker cells and myocardial contractile cells

- Excitation-contraction coupling
    - **Excitation-contraction coupling definition**
        - The process in which an action potential results in contraction of myocardial contractile cells
    - **Mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling**
        - Action potential spread to interior of cell via T-tubules
        - Influx of Ca2+ via L-type Ca2+ channels during plateau results in calcium-initiated-calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum by Ryanodine receptors
        - Ca2+ binds to troponin C to trigger contractile cycle

- **Relaxation of cardiac muscles**
    - Prevent Ca2+ entry into sarcoplasm:
        - Inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels causes the inward Ca2+ current to arrest, which abolishes the CICR trigger, such that no Ca2+ is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum
    - Remove sarcoplasmic Ca2+ (reduce sarcoplasmic Ca2+ levels to prevent next contraction from becoming stronger):
        - Sequesteration of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum via Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a)
        - Ca2+ shuttled out of cells via action of 2 channels, Ca2+-Na+ exchanger, Ca2+-ATPase
    - As a result, Ca2+ unbinds from troponin and tropomyosin re-covers the actin binding site
