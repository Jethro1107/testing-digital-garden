### Innate Immunity

- What is immunity? How is immunity classified?
    
    Immunity refers to the functional status of the defense mechanisms against diseases
    
    It is further classified into innate immunity and adaptive immunity
    
- What is an immune response?
    
    Immune response is the recognition of pathogens that prompt the defense mechanism
    
- Should a pathogen breach our immunity, where will the invading pathogens be found?
    
    Cytosolic pathogens, intravesicular pathogens, and extracellular pathogens and toxins
    
- What are the major defense mechanisms in innate immunity?
    
    Defense barrier - Mechanical Barrier, Chemical Barrier, and the Microbiological barrier
    
    Cellular - Phagocytes and NK cells
    
    Humoral - Soluble factors
    
- What constitutes the defense barrier?
    
    Mechanical Barrier:
    
    Skin and Mucosa - Mechanical barrier to prevent the entry of pathogens
    
    Defensin is secreted by epithelial cells have bactericidal actions
    
    Mucus in the mucosa traps the invading pathogens, which is removed by cilia action
    
    Washing effects of tears, saliva and urine are also mechanical factors that protect mechanical surfaces
    
    Chemical barriers:
    
    Lysozyme in tears and saliva, pepsin and hydrochloric acid in gastric juice
    
    Microbial factors:
    
    Normal flora offer microbial protection by suppressing the growth of pathogens by competition of nutrients or by production of inhibitory substances
    
- What happens when pathogens breach the defense barriers and enter our body?
    
    Two innate defense mechanisms come into play: Phagocytosis and soluble factors
    
- What are the two professional phagocytes in our body?
    
    Neutrophil and Macrophage
    
- Describe the phagocytic process.
    
    Chemotaxis to attract phagocytes from peripheral blood to inflamed tissue
    
    Adherence of phagocyte to pathogen 
    
    Ingestion of pathogen by forming phagosome
    
    Phagosome fuse with lysosome to form phagolysosome to digest the pathogen
    
    The microbial products are then released, or presented to lymphocytes
    
- Elaborate on the mononuclear phagocyte system.
    
    Precursors of monocytes are present in the bone marrow
    
    Monocytes, precursors of macrophages are present in circulation
    
    Monocytes will leave circulation and enter tissue and mature into macrophages
    
    Macrophages in different sites have different names:
    
    Lungs - Alveoli macrophages
    
    Liver - Kupffer cells
    
    Brain - Microglial cells
    
- What is the significance of phagocytes in our normal physiology?
    
    Phagocytes are responsible for erythrocyte clearance
    
    RBC membrane mainly consist of CD47 and sialic acids at normal levels, whic prevent phagocytosis
    
    Oxidative damage or cellular senescence of RBC will lower the levels of constituents in the RBC membrane, triggering phagocytosis for erythrocyte clearance
    
- What are clinical diseases related to defects in phagocytosis?
    
    Chronic granulomatous disease - Defects in neutrophil killing
    
    Macrophage-activation syndrome - Uncontrolled activation and proliferation of macrophages, leading to a cytokine storm
    

### Soluble Factors

- What are the three types of soluble factors?
    
    Acute phase protein
    
    Complement
    
    Interferon
    

**Acute Phase Protein**

- When and where is acute phase protein synthesized?
    
    Microbe induces the macrophages to produce IL-6, which acts on hepatocytes to produce acute phase protein
    
    Hence, it produced in the liver upon microbe stimulation, thus there is marked increase in APP levels in serum upon infection
    
- What is the function of acute phase protein?
    
    Acute phase protein, particularly C-reactive protein and Amyloid protein bind to the surface of the pathogens
    
    APP acts as an opsonin (a functional relish) to trigger opsonization, enhancing phagocytosis
    

**Complements**

- What are complements?
    
    Complements are a family of at least 30 different protein that complement the immune system
    
- Describe the process of C5-C9 complement activation.
    
    Antigen-Antibody complex activates the classical pathway, which results in C3 fragmentation into C3a and C3b
    
    C3b triggers activation of C5-C9, which forms a channel like structure inserted into the membrane of the protein, known as the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), causing influx of Na+ and water, causing microbe lysis
    
- What are the functions of complements?
    
    Bacterial lysis - Formation of MAC upon complement activation triggers bacterial lysis
    
    Chemotaxis - Complements serve as chemotactic signals to recruit phagocytes to infected sites
    
    Opsonization - Complements may adhere to surface of the pathogen, enhancing phagocytosis
    

**Interferons**

- What are interferons?
    
    Interferon is a class of interferon proteins produced by certain cells
    
- What are the different types of interferons and by which type of cells are they produced by?
    
    Interferon alpha - Produced by virus infected leukocytes
    
    Interferon beta - Produced by fibroblasts and presumably other cells as well
    
    Interferon gamma - Produced by T lymphocytes and NK cells
    
- What are the functions of interferons?
    
    Induce resistance of viral replication in all cells:
    
    Interferons bind to receptors of uninfected cells, activating two genes. One, a protein kinase that phosphorylate ribosomal protein and an initiation factor of protein synthesis, thus down regulating mRNA translation. The other catalyses the formation of adenylic acid, which activates a latent endonuclease to degrade both viral and host DNA.
    
    This prevents translation, thus halting viral replication
    
    Increase Viral Antigen presentation:
    
    Increase MHC class 1 activation to increase Viral antigen presentation
    
    Activate NK cells to kill virus-infected cells
    

### Natural Killer Cells

- How do NK cells exhibit cytotoxicity?
    
    NK cells integrate information from inhibitory and activation receptor
    
    The killing process is by releasing granzymes and perforin
