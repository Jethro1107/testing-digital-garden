### Calcium Channel Blockers

- Calcium channels
    - **3 families of calcium channels**
        1. high voltage-activated dihydropyridine sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels
        2. high voltage-activated dihydropyridine-insensitive L-type Ca2+ chanels
        3. low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels
    - **Role of L-type calcium channels in cardiovascular system**
        
        Action in cardiomyocytes:
        
        In pacemaker cells, L-type calcium channels mediate action potential generation, thus it regulates heart rate
        
        In contractile cells, L-type calcium channels regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration, thus it regulates contractility of the heart
        
        In vascular smooth muscle cells, L-type calcium channels regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration, thus it regulates contraction of VSMC, resulting in vasoconstriction
        
- Calcium channel blockers
    - **Function of CCB and use**
        
        Preferentially block L-type calcium channels
        
        Used in management of angina, arrhythmia and hypertension
        
    
    - **3 structural class of CCB and examples**
        
        Vasular sensitive:
        
        dihydropyridines - nifedipine, amlodipine
        
        Cardiac sensitive:
        
        benzodiazapine - diltiazem
        
        Phenylalkylamine - verapamil
        
    - **Vasodilation potency and effects on heart of vascular-sensitive CCB**
        
        Vascular-sensitive CCB - nifedipine, amlodipine:
        
        Prevents influx of Ca2+ into VSMC, resulting in decreased in intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions, resulting in relaxation of VSMC and vasodilation
        
        Little effect on cardiomyocytes, thus no inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic (conduction velocity) effects
        
    - **Vasodilation potency and effects on heart of cardiac-sensitive CCB**
        
        Cardiac selective CCB - verapamil, diltiazem:
        
        Prevents influx of Ca2+ into cardiomyocytes, resulting in decreased inotropic (contractile cells), chronotropic (pacemaker cells in SA node) and dromotropic (pacemaker cells in AV nodes) effects
        
        Also blocks L-type Ca2+ channels in VSMC, resulting in decreased intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions, resulting in relaxation of VSMC and vasodilation. However, vasodilation potency of cardiac-sensitive CCB is lower than that of vascular-sensitive CCB
        
    
    - **Adverse effect of CCB**
        
        For all CCB:
        
        Hypotension - due to decreased vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output
        
        For vascular-selective CCB:
        
        Reflex tachycardia due to drop in blood pressure (and little effect of CCB on cardiomyocytes)
        
        Oedema, due to increased capillary blood flow
        
        Flushing due to vasodilation
        
        For cardiac-selective CCB:
        
        Reduced cardiac output may precipitate into heart failure
        
    - CCB as antihypertensive drug
        - **MOA of vascular-sensitive CCB as antihypertensives**
            
            Prevents influx of Ca2+ into VSMC, resulting in decreased in intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions
            
            This results in decrease in Ca2+-calmoudurin complex, resulting in decreased MLCK activity
            
            Myosin phosphatase removes phosphate group from myosin head, preventing actin-myosin interaction and hence relaxation and vasodilation
            
            This results in decrease in total peripheral resistance, thus causing a decrease in blood pressure
            
        - **Considerations of CCB as antihypertensive drugs**
            
            Mainly vascular-sensitive CCB is used, i.e. nifedipine, amlodipine
            
            Nifedipine has a short half life, which results in increased sympathetic activity between dose intervals, resulting in oscilating blood pressure, thus has limited clinical usage
            
            CCB with longer half life, i.e. amlodipine, or nifedipine with a sustained-release formulation enables relatively constant plasma concentration of CCB, resulting in a steady blood pressure and decreased adverse effects, e.g. flushing, dizziness and oedema
            
            CCB may affect non vascular smooth muscles, e.g. relaxation of lower oesophageal sphincter, resulting in gastrointestinal reflux
            
        - **Variations in antihypertensive effectiveness in different patients**
            
            Effective for isolated systolic hypertension
            
            Effective for patients with low renin status
            
    - CCB as antiarrhythmic drug
        - **MOA of cardiac-sensitive CCB as antiarrhythmic drugs**
            
            Prevents influx of Ca2+ into cardiac myocytes, resulting in negative inotropic, chronotropic and dronotropic activity
            
            It also prevents intracellular Ca2+ overload, preventing delayed afterdepolarization mediated arrhythmia
            
        - **Precaution of cardiac-sensitive CCB** üôÅ
            
            Cautious with patients with hepatic dysfunction, as CCB is metabolised by liver
            
            Avoid in ventricular tachycardia, as it may result in hypotension and cardiac arrest
            

### Alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents

- Alpha-adrenergic receptors and blockers
    - alpha-1 adrenergic receptor
        - **Typical location of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors**
            
            Smooth muscles
            
        - **Function and intracellular signalling pathway of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor**
            
            Binding of norepinephrine to alpha-1 receptor triggers a GDP to GTP switch of Gq protein, causing it to divide into alpha subunit and beta/gamma subunit
            
            Alpha subunit of Gq protein activates PLC, resulting in formation of IP3 and DAG
            
            IP3 stimulates release of Ca2+ from SR, causing an increase in intracellular calcium levels
            
    - alpha-1 blocker
        - **Example of alpha-1 blocker**
            
            Prazosin, Doxazosin
            
        - **MOA of alpha-1 blocker as antihypertensives**
            
            Selectively inhibit alpha-1 receptors, causing a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ levels in VSMC
            
            This results in decreased Ca2+ - Calmoudulin complex, causing decreased MLCK activity
            
            Myosin phosphatase remove phosphate group from myosin head, inhibiting actin-myosin interaction, and thus relaxation of VSMC and vasodilation
            
            This results in decreased total peripheral resistance, and causes a decrease in blood pressure
            
        - **Adverse effect of alpha-1 blockers**
            
            Dizziness, headaches - due to decreased blood pressure
            
            Palpitations (awareness of pounding heart beat) - due to reflex tachycardia
            
        - **Precautions of alpha-1 blockers**
            
            First dose phenomenon - Orthostatic hypotension with initial dose and dose increase (especially with conconmitent use of diuretics)
            
        - **Limitation of alpha-1 blocker as antihypertensive drugs** üò¢
            
            Decrease in blood pressure triggers increased sympathetic activity and renin release
            
            Increased symathetic activity causes an increase in heart rate and contractility of heart and hence, resulting in increased in cardiac output, and an increase in blood pressure
            
            Renin release by JG cells results in angiotensin II formation and aldosterone secretion, which promotes Na+ and water reabsorption, causing an increase in blood pressure
            
            Antihypertensive action is opposed by the autonomic and tubuloglomerular feedback
            
            Hence, alpha-1 blockers are used in combination therapy with diuretics (inhibit tubuloglomerular feedback) and beta-blockers (prevent cardiac compensation)
            
- Beta-adrenergic receptors and blockers
    - beta-adrenergic receptor
        - **Typical location of beta-1 adrenergic receptor**
            
            Heart, Juxtaglomerular apparatus
            
        - **Function and intracellular signalling pathway of beta-1 adrenergic receptor**
            
            When chatacholamines bind to beta-1 adrenergic receptor, it results in a GDP to GTP switch in Gs proteins, such that it dissociates into alpha and beta/gamma subunit
            
            Alpha subunit of Gs protein activates adenyl cyclase, resulting in increased cAMP production
            
        - **Typical location of beta-2 adrenergic receptor**
            
            Smooth muscles
            
        - **Function and intracellular signalling pathway of beta-2 adrenergic receptor**
            
            When chatacholamines bind to beta-2 adrenergic receptor, it results in a GDP to GTP switch in Gs proteins, such that it dissociates into alpha and beta/gamma subunit
            
            Alpha subunit of Gs protein activates adenyl cyclase, resulting in increased cAMP production
            
    - beta blockers
        - **Examples of beta-1 blockers**
            
            Propanalol, metoprolol, pindolol
            
        - **Clinical uses of beta blockers**
            
            Management of angina, arrhythmia, hypertension, chronic heart failure, and myocardial infarction
            
        - **MOA of beta blockers as antihypertensives**
            
            Inhibits beta-1 receptors on heart, causing a decrease in heart rate and contractility of heart, thus causing a decreased cardiac output
            
            Inhibit beta-1 receptors in Juxtaglomerular apparatus, causing decreased renin release and reabsorption of Na+ and water
            
            Inhibit peripheral presynaptic beta receptors, causing decreased norepinephrine release, and decreased sympathetic vasoconstriction activity, thus decreasing peripheral resistance
            
        - **Classification of beta blockers and examples**
            
            1st generation (non-selective beta blockers) - propanolol
            
            2nd generation (selective beta-1 receptor antagonist) - metoprolol, esmolol, bisoprolol
            
            3rd generation (beta blockers with vasodilator effects):
            
            beta and alpha-1 antagonists - labetalol, carvedilol
            
            beta blockers that stimulate release of NO by endothelial cells - nebivolol
            
            4th generation (beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, i.e. partial agonist) - pindolol, acebutolol
            
        - **Adverse effect of beta blockers**
            1. Increased risk of arrhythmia and heart failure:
                
                Due to inhibition of beta-1 receptors on heart, resulting in decreased heart rate and contractility
                
                Less likely when using pindolol as it has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity
                
            2. Central nervous system disturbance (mild sedation, vivid dreams, depression):
                
                Due to inhibition of beta receptors in central nervous system
                
                Consider discontinuation in patients developing psychiatric depression
                
                Less likely with beta blockers with low lipid solubility (able to cross the blood brain barrier)
                
        - **Adverse effect of 1st-generation non-specific beta blockers**
            1. Bronchospasm
                
                Due to inhibition of beta-2 receptors on smooth muscles of respiratory tract
                
                Contraindicate in asthma/obstructive airway disease patients
                
            2. Hypoglycemia
                
                Due to inibition of beta receptors in liver
                
                Contraindicate in DM patients
                
            3. Vasoconstriction
                
                Due to inhibition of beta receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells
                
                Contraindicate in vascular disease patients or patients with vasospactic disorders
