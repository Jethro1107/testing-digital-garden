### Pulmonary circulation

- Distribution of blood flow in an upright lung
    - **Distribution of blood flow in an upright lung**
        - Apical region has less perfusion, while basal region has higher perfusion
    - **Explanation for uneven perfusion in an upright lung**
        - Perfusion depends on the pressure difference between arterial pressure and venous pressure (or alveolar pressure, if alveolar pressure is greater than that of venous pressure)
        - Pulmonary arterial pressure decreases as we move up the lung due to gravitational effects

        - There may be a region at the top of the lung (zone 1), where pulmonary arterial pressure falls below alveolar pressure (normally close to atmospheric pressure). If this occurs, the capillaries are squashed flat, and no flow is possible. Zone 1 does not occur under normal conditions, because the pulmonary arterial pressure is just sufficient to raise blood to the top of the lung, but may be present if the arterial pressure is reduced (e.g., with septic shock or hemorrhage) or if alveolar pressure is raised, as occurs during positive pressure ventilation. This ventilated but unperfused lung is useless for gas exchange and is called alveolar dead space.
        - Farther down the lung (zone 2), pulmonary arterial pressure increases because of the hydrostatic effect and now exceeds alveolar pressure. However, venous pressure is still very low and is less than alveolar pressure, which leads to remarkable pressure-flow characteristics. Under these conditions, blood flow is determined by the difference between arterial and alveolar pressures (not the usual arterial-venous pressure difference). Indeed, venous pressure has no influence on flow unless it exceeds alveolar pressure.
        - In zone 3, venous pressure now exceeds alveolar pressure, and flow is determined in the usual way by the arterial-venous pressure difference. The increase in blood flow down this region of the lung is apparently caused chiefly by distension of the capillaries. The pressure within them (lying between arterial and venous) increases down the zone, while the pressure outside (alveolar) remains constant. Thus, their transmural pressure rises and, indeed, measurements show that their mean width increases. Recruitment of previously closed vessels may also play some part in the increase in blood flow down this zone.
- Main mechanisms for regulation of pulmonary blood flow: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
    - **Effects of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction**
        - Alveolar oxygen tension (alveolar PO2) regulates pulmonary circulation
        - Decrease in alveolar PO2 (Alveolar hypoxia) causes vasoconstriction in small pulmonary arteries, while an increase in alveolar PO2 causes vasodilation in small pulmonary arteries and arterioles
    - **Physiological significance of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in decrease in local PO2**
        - When local PO2 decreases, it results in local vasoconstriction, thus diverting blood flow away from the hypoxic region, thereby reducing the deleterious effects on gas exchange
    - **Effects of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in global decrease in PO2**
        - When global PO2 decreases, it results in a generalized pulmonary vasoconstriction, causing an increase pulmonary arterial pressure, and increased work for the right heart, eventually resulting in right heart hypertrophy and failure if severe
        - **Pathological condition of right heart disorder caused by primary lug disorder**
            - Cor pulmonale

### Ventilation-perfusion inequality

- **Importance of ventilation-perfusion ratio**
    - Matching of ventilation and perfusion is essential for adequate gas exchange
- **Normal ventilation-perfusion ratio of a lung unit**
    - The normal ventilation-perfusion ratio of the lung as a whole is 0.8
- Effects of altering ventilation-perfusion ratio of a lung unit
    - **Effects on alveolar partial pressure of gases as a result of decrease in VQ ratio due to obstructed ventilation**
        - When ventilation is obstructed, and blood flow is kept normal, VQ ratio is reduced, and alveolar PO2 decreases and alveolar PCO2 increases
        - When airway is completely obstructed, i.e. there is no ventilation, VQ ratio equals to zero, the PO2 and PCO2 of alveoli and end-capillary blood thus equilibrates with that of systemic venous blood
    - **Effects on alveolar partial pressure of gases as a result of increase in VQ ratio due to obstructed blood flow**
        - When blood flow is obstructed and ventilation is kept normal, VQ ratio is increased, and alveolar PO2 increases and alveolar PCO2 decreases
        - When blood flow is completely obstructed, i.e. there is no perfusion, VQ ratio approaches infinity, the PO2 and PCO2 of alveoli and end-capillary blood thus equilibrates with that of inspired air
- Regional gas exchange in the lung
    - **Changes in regional ventilation-perfusion ratio up the lung**
        - Ventilation decreases slowly as we move up the lung, and blood flow decreases rapidly as we move up the lung, as a result VQ ratio increases non-linearly as we move up the lung, with abnormally high VQ ratio at the apex of the lung, and extremely low at the base of the lung

    - **Effects of regional difference in ventilation-perfusion ratio on alveolar partial pressures up the lung**
        - As VQ ratio increases up the lung, alveolar PO2 increases up the lung and alveolar PCO2 decreases up the lung

- **Effect of regional ventilation-perfusion inequality on overall gas exchange of lung**
    - **Depression of arterial PO2**
        - The increase in content of O2 due to the higher alveolar PO2 at regions with high VQ ratio (i.e. the apex) is smaller than the decrease in content of O2 due to the lower alveolar PO2 at regions with low VQ ratio as a result of the oxygen dissociation curve
        - To put it simply, the regions of high VQ ratio cannot compensate for the problems caused by a low VQ ratio
        - Furthermore, the base region, where PO2 is low, receives more blood flow
        - The overall effect is the depression of arterial PO2, as compared to a lung with homogenous VQ matching
    - **CO2 retention**
        - The base region, where PCO2 is high receives more blood flow
        - Hence, there is CO2 retention, as compared to a lung with homogenous VQ matching
        - Note that the decrease in CO2 content due to a lower alveolar PCO2 at region with high VQ ratio (i.e. the apex) is equal to the increase in CO2 content due to high alveolar PCO2 at region with low VQ ratio as the CO2 dissociation curve is quite linear
    - **Effects of VQ mismatching on ventilatory compensation to hypoxemia**
        - In the base region, where VQ ratio is low to begin with, the increase in ventilation causes an increase in PO2, within the range of a steep slope in O2 dissociation curve, which causes a great increase in content of O2
        - In the apex region, where, where VQ ratio is high to begin with, the increase in ventilation causes an increase in PO2, within the range of gentle slope in O2 dissociation curve, such that the increase in content of O2 is negligible
        - Hence, some hypoxemia remains
    - **Effects of VQ mismatching on ventilatory compensation to hypercapnea**
        - Increase in ventilation causes a decrease in PCO2, which causes a decrease in content of CO2 in all alveoli due to the linear CO2 dissociation curve, such that increase in arterial PCO2 can be resolved
- **Assessment of ventilation-perfusion inequality**
    - Measurements of arterial PO2
        - Caveat of this method - Low arterial PO2 can indicate numerous causes, including hypoventilation, ventilation-perfusion inequality shunt
    - Measurements of alveolar-arterial O2 gradient
    - Measurement of Physiological dead space (VQ ratio approaches infinity)
    - Measurement of physiological shunt
        - Physiological shunt in lungs - Refers blood passing the arterial system without passing the ventilated areas, such that partial pressure of gases of shunt blood equals to that of venous blood
