### Interstitial cells of Cajal generate slow waves that mediate gastric motor functions

Interstitial cells of Cajal can be found in the myenteric plexus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric nervous system\|Enteric nervous system]]) in the greater curvature at the junction between the fundus and the body.

They generate slow waves (undulating changes in the resting potential), at a rate of 3 times per minute.

They are capable of generating action potentials (spike potentials), that propagates along smooth muscles from the body to the antrum, resulting in a peristaltic constricting ring of contraction that extends from the body to the antrum.

Slow waves underlie the contractions in:

- Phasic contractions of the stomach in fed state, Migrating motor complex
- [[Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme\|Trituration - the mixing and propulsion of food in the stomach to give chyme]]
- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gastric emptying\|Gastric emptying]]
