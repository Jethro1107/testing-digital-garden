### Radius

The radius forms part of the bony framework of the forearm. It occupies the lateral position, relative to the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Ulna\|Ulna]].

- **Classification of the radius**
    
    The radius is a long bone.
    
- **Proximal end of the radius**
    
    The proximal end of the radius consist of a head, which is a disk-shaped structure (cylindrical).
    
    Distal to the head is the neck, which is a disc-shaped structure that separates the head from the radial/ bicipital tuberosity.
    
    The bicipital tuberosity lies medial to the neck. It serves as the attachment of the bicep brachii tendon.

- **Shaft of the radius**
    
    The shaft of the radius consist of 3 borders - The anterior border, the posterior border and the interosseous (between two bones) border.
    
    Of more significance, the interosseous membrane is attached to the sharp interosseous border, in holds the radius and ulna together. It enables the force transmission between the radius and ulna.
    
- **Distal end of the radius**
    
    On the posterior surface, the dorsal tubercle is present, which serves as a pulley for one of the extensor muscles of the thumb.
    
    On the lateral side, forms a diamond-shaped structure that extends distally, the styloid process.
