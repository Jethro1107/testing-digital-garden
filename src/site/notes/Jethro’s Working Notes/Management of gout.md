### Management of gout

In different phases of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Gout\|Gout]], there are different pharmacological management approach due to the different aims.

- ************************************************In acute gouty arthritis************************************************
    
    The aim is to reduce inflammation to relieve symptoms.
    
    Hence, anti-inflammatory drugs are used.
    
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Colchicine\|Colchicine]] is the first-line treatment
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/NSAID\|NSAID]] can also be used. Indomethacin is commonly used for its potent anti-inflammatory effects, while tolmetin is ineffective.
        
        [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Salicylate\|Salicylate]] is avoided, due to its paradoxical effects on uric acid excretion.
        
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug\|Glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug]]
        
        Gluccocorticoids is prevered over NSAID in patients with advanced hepatic or renal disease.
        
        Dose tapering is needed.
        
    - IL-1 inhibitors are used
        - **********************************************Examples of IL-1 inhibitors**********************************************
            
            Anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept

- ******************************************************************************************************************In between gouty attacks (i.e. intercritical gout and chronic tophaceous gout)******************************************************************************************************************
    
    The aim is to correct hyperuricemia, as to prevent the subsequent acute gouty arthritis, and slows progression to chronic tophaceous gout.
    
    [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Urate-lowering agents\|Urate-lowering agents]] is used, in conjunction with anti-inflammatory drugs initially as [[Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares\|Urate-lowering agents can precipitate acute gouty flares]].
