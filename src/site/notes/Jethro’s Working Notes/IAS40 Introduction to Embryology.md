### Overview of Prenatal Development

- What is prenatal development? What are the three stages involved?
    
    Prenatal development refers to the entire developmental process from conception to birth, involving three stages: Germinal Period, Embryonic Period, and Fetal Period
    
- How is the germinal period defined?
    
    First 2 weeks of development, including the formation of the three primative germ layers
    
- How is the embryonic period defined?
    
    From third to eighth week of development, when organ systems develop (embryogenesis/organgenesis)
    
- How is the fetal period defined?
    
    Last 30 weeks of development, organ systems grow and mature
    
- How is the clinical age of the embryo calculated?
    
    Using the last menstrual period as a reference point to calculate the clinical age of the unborn child
    
- How is the postovulatory age of the embryo calculated?
    
    Uses ovulation as a reference point
    
    Since ovulation occurs roughly 14 days after menstruation, post ovulatory age is 14 days less than the clinical age
    

### Gametogenesis

- What cell types are gametes derived from?
    
    Primordial germ cells
    
- What cell types are PGC derived from? Describe the path of migration.
    
    From epiblast
    
    At 2nd week of development, epiblast differentiate to give PGC, which migrate to the yolk sac
    
    From the 4th to 5th week of development, PGC migrate to the future gonads
    
- What are the two processes in gametogenesis in both male and female? What are their significance?
    
    Meiosis and cytodifferentiation
    
    Meiosis to reduce to haploid number of chromosomes
    
    Cytodifferentiation to complete their maturation
    
- Define oogenesis.
    
    Oogenesis is the sequence of events by which oogonia is transformed into mature oocytes
    
- Describe the process of oogenesis.
    
    Primordial germ cells migrating to ovary divide mitotically and differentiate into oogonia 
    
    Most oogonia die
    
    In the 3rd month of development, oogonia divides mitotically, some enters meiotic division, but arrest at prophase I, giving rise to primary oocyte
    
    Primary oocyte starts to be surrounded by follicular cells, forming the primordial follicle, where oogenesis stops until puberty
    
    Starting from puberty, primordial follicle matures to vesicular follicle
    
    Follicular cells of primordial follicle form granulosa cell, which secrets glycoproteins to form the zona pellucida, forming a primary follicle
    
    Primary follicle matures to vesicular follicle by formation of antrum
    
    During development from primary oocyte to vesicular follicle, Meiotic division I is completed
    
    One cell, obtaining most of the cytoplasm, forms the secondary oocyte, while the other forms the first polar body
    
    Before ovulation, the oocyte enters meiotic division II and arrests at metaphase II
    
    Ref: [[Langmans Embryology  Morphological changes during oogenesis\|Langmans Embryology  Morphological changes during oogenesis]] 
    
- How many oocyte can be derived from one PGC?
    
    1
    
- Describe the process of differentiation from PGC to spermatids.
    
    PGC remains in gonad, and only start to differentiate into primary spermatocyte after puberty
    
    Spermatocyte enters meiotic division
    
    After meiotic division I, 2 secondary spermatocytes are formed
    
    After meiotic division II, 4 spermatids are formed
    
- Define spermiogenesis.
    
    Spermiogenesis is the process in which round spermatids transform into elongated sperm
    
- Describe the process of spermiogenesis.
    
    The entire process of spermiogenesis involves:
    
    Loss of cytoplasm
    
    Development of the tail
    
    And formation of acrosome
    
    The acrosome is a cap structure capping off the nucleus, derived from the Golgi apparatus
    
    It contains enzymes to digest the zona pellucida
    
- Describe the morphology of a mature male gamete.
    
    Head - consist of haploid nucleus capped by acrosome
    
    Neck
    
    Tail - consist of middle piece (mitochondria location), principal piece and end piece
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
- Describe the morphology of a mature female gamete.
    
    Surrounded by zona pellucida and corona radiata (made of follicular cells)
    

### Fertilization

- Define fertilization.
    
    Fertilization, the process by which male and female gametes fuse, occurs in the ampullary region of the uterine tube.
    
- What are the four basic results of fertilization?
    
    Stimulate the penetrated oocyte to complete meiotic division II
    
    Restore diploidy
    
    Initiate cleavage of the zygote
    
    Sex determination
    
- Describe the three phases of oocyte penetration.
    1. Penetration of corona radiata by squeezing through the follicular cells
    2. Penetration of zona pellucida using enzymes from acrosome
    3. Fusion of cell membrane of sperm and oocyte to release sperm DNA into oocyte
    
    ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
    
- What is polyspermy? How is it prevented during oocyte penetration?
    
    Polyspermy, fertilization of an ovum by more than one sperm
    
    When fusion of cell membrane of sperm and oocyte occurs, it triggers cortical and zona reaction
    
    Cortical reaction: Release of cortical granules render the oocyte cell membrane impenetrable to other sperms
    
    Zona reaction: Zona pellucida alters its structure and composition to prevent sperm from penetration
    
- What is the pronuclear stage of a fertilized oocyte?
    
    Presence of male and female pronucleus
    

### Post-fertilization

- Give an overview of the different processes after fertilization.
    1. Cleavage
    2. Development of the zygote from two-cell stage to the morula stage
    3. Compaction
- When does cleavage occur?
    
    Immediately after fertilization, the DNA of the zygote replicates and enters into mitotic cell division
    
- What are the importance of cleavage?
    
    Restore normal cytoplasm:nucleus ratio, which was increased in meiotic division 1 of primary oocyte to secondary oocyte (receives most of the cytoplasm)
    
    Activate transcription and protein synthesis
    
    Change from hexose monophosphate oxidation to glycolysis pathway to meet increased energy demands
    
    Maternal recognition of pregnancy
    
    Cell fate determination
    
- Describe the development of morula stage.
    
    Zygote undergoes several rounds of cleavage division
    
    By 16-cell stage, morula is formed
    
- What is compaction?
    
    Compaction - cells form tight junctions to maximize cell-cell contact
    
    The cell boundaries after compaction is no longer clear
    
- What is the function of compaction?
    
    Separates the inner cell mass and outer cell mass
    
    Allows extensive communication of inner cells
    

### Blastogenesis

- Describe the process of blastogenesis.
    
    When morula enters the uterine cavity, fluids enter penetrate the zona pellucida into the intercellular space of the inner cell mass, forming the blastocystic cavity
    
    The morula now becomes the blastocyst
    
- Describe the morphology of the blastocyst.
    
    A blastocystic cavity can be observed
    
    Embryoblast - Inner cell mass giving rise to the embryo
    
    Trophoblast - Outer cell mass giving rise to the placenta
    
- What happens to the zona pellucida during development of blastocyst? What is the significance of this event?
    
    It sheds off, allowing the embryo to increase in size
    

### Implantation

- What is implantation?
    
    Embedding of blastocyst onto uterine wall
    
- What are the two phases of implantation?
    
    Attachment phase - characterised by increase in vascular permeability in the stroma underlying the conceptus, oedema and change in ECM composition
    
    Invasion phase - Cytotrophoblast divide mitotically to supply cells to differentiate into syncitiotrophoblast cells, which fuse together and erode the endometrium to invade into the uterine wall
    
- What are the properties of syncytiotrophoblast cells?
    
    Non-dividing, differentiated from cytotrophoblast cells
    
    Secretes HCG
