### Diverticular disease of the colon

- **What is diverticular disease?**
    
    Diverticular disease refers to the formation of acquired pseudodiverticular outpouching (also known as *false diverticulum*) of the colonic mucosa and submucosa. This is in contrast of a true diverticulum (Meckel diverticulum) where it involves all 3 layers of the colonic wall.
    
- **Pathogenesis of diverticular disease**
    
    Diverticular diseases are a product of the unique structure of the muscularis propria in the colon.
    
    In both the small and large intestine, the discontinuation of inner circular muscles enable the penetration of nerves and vasa recta. In the small intestine, the inner circular muscle layer is reinforced by an outer longitudinal muscle, which prevents mucosal and submucosal penetration. In the colon, however, the outer circular muscle aggregates into 3 longitudinal bands (taeniae coli), with discontinues between each taeniae. ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Histology of the large intestine\|Histology of the large intestine]]) This unique structure in the colon underlies the formation of diverticula. Hence, diverticular formation usually occurs in the colon (particularly *sigmoid colon* as a result of exagerated intraluminal pressure), but rarely in the small intestine.

    Low fibre diet, chronic constipation and hard stool results in exagerated peristaltic contractions and elevated intraluminal pressure.
    
    This results in the mucosa and submucosa to herniate through the muscularis propria, resulting in the formation of diverticula.
    
- **Clinical features of diverticular disease**
    
    Most people with diverticular diseases are assymptomatic.
    
    Diverticulum can become inflamed, resulting in diverticulitis, or filled with pus, forming a diverticular abscess.
    
    - The most common symptom is  lower abdominal pain, which usually resolves spontaneously.
