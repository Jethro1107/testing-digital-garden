### Colorectal carcinoma

- **What is colorectal carcinoma?**
    
    Colorectal carcinoma are carcinomas arising from the epithelium of the large bowel. It is the second most common cancer in Hong Kong.
    
    Colorectal carcinoma usually arises at 60-70 years old.
    
- **Gross pathology of colorectal carcinoma**
    
    Colorectal carcinoma appears as polypoid mass, often with central ulceration (with a necrotic dirty base) and everted edges.
    
    Sometimes, it forms a constricting annular mass around the entire colonic circumference.
    
- **Histopathology of colorectal carcinoma**
    
    The carcinoma consist of irregular cuboidal to columnar cells forming irregular gland structures.
    
    Cells show malignant cytology: High N:C ratio, nuclear pleomorphism, nuclear hyperchromatism, irregular mitosis.
    
    There is invasion beyond the muscularis mucosae. This defines a malignant colorectal neoplasm.

- **Pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma**
- **Tumour grading of colorectal carcinoma**
    
    Tumour grading depends on the degree of differentiation of the malignant cells (i.e. the resemblance to normal colonic epithelial cells). It may be well differentiated, moderately differentiated, or poorly differentiated.
    
    - Clinically, grade is determined by how much gland formation the tumour has.
- **Tumour staging of colorectal carcinoma**
    
    Colorectal carcinoma staging follows the TMN system:
    
    - Depth of tumour invasion (T)
        - Into submucosa
        - Into muscularis propria
        - Beyond muscularis propria
        - Perforation of visceral peritoneum
        - Invasion into adjacent organs
    - Number of regional lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma (N)
    - Presence of distant metastasis (M)
- **Clinical features of colorectal carcinoma**
    
    Clinical presentation of colorectal carcinoma differs in the position of the tumour:
    
    | Left colon (descending) | Right colon (ascending) |
    | --- | --- |
    | Altered bowel habits (due to obstruction) | Anemia (The watery stool at the right colon and relatively larger lumen enables tumour to grow larger) |
    | Hematochezia (passage of fresh blood in stool) | Malaise, weight loss |
    | Tenesmus - the feeling of the need to pass stool even when you don’t need to (if tumour in rectum) | Little altered bowel habits is reported as fluid stool can pass through tumour constrictions |
- **Risk factors of colorectal carcinoma**
    
    Dietary risk factors - Low fibre intake, consumption of red meat and refined carbohydrates
    
    Lifestyle risk factors - Obesity, sendentary lifestyle, smoking
