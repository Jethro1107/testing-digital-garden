### Scapulae

The scapulae is classified as a flat bone. It is a large triangular bone that overlies the ribs, with:

- 3 angles - The superior angle, the inferior angle and the lateral angle, which expands to form the glenoid fossa.
- 3 borders - The superior border, the medial border and the lateral border.
- 3 processes - The spine, the acromion and the corocoid process.
- 2 surfaces - The posterior surface, and the anterior surface, known as the scapular/ suprascapular fossa.
- **Glenoid fossa**
    
    The lateral angle of the scapulae forms the glenoid fossa, a pear shaped depression which serves as the socket for the [[Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)\|Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)]]]].

    The supraglenoid tubercle and infraglenoid tubercle is present. The supraglenoid serves as the attachment for the long head of the biceps brachii muscle. infraglenoid tubercle serves as the attachment for the long head of the tricep brachii muscle.

- **The spine and acromion**
    
    The spine is a process on the posterior surface which travels laterally and becomes enlarged to form the acromion (the tip of the shoulder).

- **Posterior surface**
    
    The posterior surface is separated into the supraspinous fossa and the infraspinous fossa.

- **Two structures are present on the superior border**
    
    The lateral end of the superior border forms the coracoid process, a structure that resembles the beak of the raven. It serves as a surface for the attachment of ligaments and muscles.

    Just medial to the coracoid process, the suprascapular notch is present. A ligament, the superior transverse scapular ligament closes off the notch, converting the suprascapular notch into the suprascapular foramen, which is for the passage of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Suprascapular nerve\|Suprascapular nerve]].

- **The anterior surface of the scapulae**
    
    The anterior surface of the scapulae forms the subscapular fossa. It is concave to accomodate for the roundness of the thoracic cage.
