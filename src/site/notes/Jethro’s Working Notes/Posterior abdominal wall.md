### Muscles of Posterior abdominal wall

The posterior abdominal wall consist of 4 main paired muscles:

1. Erector spinae - The erector spinae muscles are a group of muscles that  originates from the posterior part of the iliac crest and attaches along the posterior part of the vertebral column and ribs, the erector spinae muscles are surrounded by the thoracolumbar fascia.
2. Quadratus lumborum - The quadratus lumborum is a quadrilateral muscle that originates lateral to the lumbar transverse process of the L1 to L3, as well as the inferior region of the 12th rib, and inserts to the inner lip of the iliac crest and transverse process of L5. 
    
    It is lateral to the superior part of the psoas major.

3. Psoas major - The psoas major lies lateral to the lumbar vertebrae, medial and anterior to the quadratus lumborum.
    
    The psoas major originates from the transverse processes and intervertebral disc of the lumbar vertebrae, and proceeds inferolaterally and anteriorly along the pelvic brim/ pelvic inlet towards the inguinal ligament.
    
    It passes below the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Inguinal ligament\|Inguinal ligament]]  and inserts at the lesser trochanter of the femur. 
    
    It lies anterior to the lumbar plexus and the anterior ramus of lumbar spinal nerves.

1. Iliacus  - a large triangular muscle lateral to the psoas major and fills the iliac fossa.
    
    The iliacus originates from the iliac fossa and proceeds towards the inguinal ligament.
    
    At the inguinal ligament, the iliacus and psoas major fuse together to form the iliopsoas, where it passes below the inguinal ligament and inserts to the lesser trochanter of the femur.
