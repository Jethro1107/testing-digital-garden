### Sacroiliac joint
Sacroiliac joint is the articulation between the sacrum and the ilium. It serves as the only articulation between the pelvic girdle to the axial skeleton.

- **Classification of the sacroiliac joint**
    It is classified as a synovial plane joint, but unlike the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Sternoclavicular joint\|Sternoclavicular joint]], it is immovable as it is stabilised in place by the ligaments of the pelvis.
- **Stabilization of the sacroiliac joint**
    The sacroiliac joint is stabilised by the ligaments of the pelvis:
    - *Anterior sacroiliac ligament*, a thickening of the anterior aspect of the joint capsule.
    - *Interosseous sacroiliac ligament **(strongest),*** which fills the gap between the two bones.
    - *Posterior sacroiliac ligament,* which covers the interosseous sacroiliac ligament.

    Other ligaments of the pelvis also play a role in stabilizing the sacroiliac joint:
    - *Iliolumbar ligament,* which connects the ilium to the transverse process of the vertebrae.
    - *Sacrospinous ligaments,* a trianglular ligament in which the apex attaches to the ischial spine and the base attaches to the sacrum.
    - *Sacrostuberous ligaments,* a triangular ligament in which the apex attaches to the ischial tuberosity and the base attaches to the sacrum.
