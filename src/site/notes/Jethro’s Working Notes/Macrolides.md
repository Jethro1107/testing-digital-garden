### Macrolides

Macrolide is a moderate spectrum antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis. It is bacteriostatic.

- **MOA of macrolides**
    
    Macrolides binds to 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and inhibits the translation of the polypeptide chain from A site to P site catalysed by peptidyl transfer.
    
    This blocks movement of the peptidyl tRNA from acceptor site to donor site
    
    Therefore, the next tRNA cannot bind to the preoccupied acceptor site, preventing the ribosome from moving along the mRNA to expose the next codon.
    
    This inhibits protein synthesis.

- **Examples of macrolides**
    - Erythromycin
        - **Spectrum of erythromycin and clinical use**
            
            Similar narrow spectrum as penicillin G - active against gram positive bacteria
            
            Used for patients allergic to penicillin
            
    - Clarithromycin
        - **Spectrum of clarithromycin**
            
            Slightly greater activity than erythromycin
            
            Active against intracellular organisms, e.g. Chlamydia and legionella
            
            ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
            
    - Azithromycin
        - **Spectrum of azithromycin**
            
            Slightly less effective against gram positive bacteria than erythromycin
            
            Enhanced activity against gram negative bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae)
            
    - Telithromycin (ketolide)
        - **Spectrum of telithromycin**
            
            Similar spectrum as azithromycin (less effective against G+ bacteria, enhanced activity against G- bacteria)
            
            Effective against macrolide resistant strains
            
- **Adverse effect of macrolides**
    
    Low toxicity, high therapeutic index
    
    1. GI disturbance (due to stimulation of motilin receptors) - nausea, diarrhoea, epigastric pain
    2. High dose of erythromycin can cause deafness
    3. QT interval prolongation
    4. Hepatotoxicity - estolate salt (e.g. erythromycin estolate) can cause acute cholestatic hepatitis due to hypersensitivity reaction
    5. Drug interactions (CYP3A4) can occur except for azithromycin
- **Mechanism of macrolide resistance**
    1. Reduced permeability of cell membrane and active efflux (not for telithromycin/ketolide),
    2. Inactivation of macrolide by macrolide esterase, phosphotransferase or glycosyltransferase
        
        ![[Untitled\|Untitled]]
        
    3. Genetic modification of 50S subunit binding site, by:
        
        Chromosome mutation
        
        Macrolide inducible or constituitive methylase that causes methylation of 50S subunit
