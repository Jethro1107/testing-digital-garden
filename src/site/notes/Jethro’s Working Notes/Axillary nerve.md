### Axillary nerve

The axillary nerve (C5-C6) is a small terminal branch of the posterior cord of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial plexus\|Brachial plexus]]. 

It descends and courses laterally on the posterior axillary wall, and accesses the posterior scapular region via the quadrangular space, to supply the teres minor and the the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Deltoid\|Deltoid]].

A *superior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm* originates from the axillary nerve and loops behind the posterior margin of the deltoid muscle to innervate the skin in that region (a small area on the lateral side of the arm near the insertion of the deltoid).
