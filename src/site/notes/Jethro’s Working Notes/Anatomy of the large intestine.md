### Anatomy of the large intestine

The large intestine is the segment of the GI tract that is distal to the ileo-cecal valve.

The large intestine is characterised by teniae coli, which are aggregates of smooth muscle of the outer longitudinal layer of the muscularis externae, forming 3 longitudinal bands of smooth muscles ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Histology of the large intestine\|Histology of the large intestine]]). It is also characterised with the haustras, which are pouch like structures (sacculations) of the large intestine between teniae coli. Another feature is the epiploid appendices (fatty appendices/projection of the colon). Also, it has a much greater caliber (diameter) than small intestines.

The large intestine is separated into the cecum and appendix, colon, the rectum and anal canal.

- ************************************************Cecum and appendix************************************************
    
    The cecum is the proximal part of the large intestine, inferior to the termina ileum, and located on the right iliac fossa. It is quite mobile, as it is not suspended by mesenteries.
    
    The appendix is an intestinal diverticuli, and is suspended from the terminal ileum by the mesoappendix.
    
    The apendix is almost always continuous with the anterior teniae coli, but distally, its position varies:
    
    - It may be anterior or posterior to the terminal ileum (preileal or post-ileal)
    - It may be posterior to the cecum (retrocecal)
    - It may be inferior to the cecum (subcecal)
    - It may descend into the pelvic cavity (pelvic)
    
    The appendix is rich in lymphoid tissue.
    
- **********Colon**********
    
    The colon consist of 4 parts: ascending (right), transverse, descending (left) and sigmoid:
    
    - Ascending colon - The ascending colon is secondarily retroperitoeal and extends from the level of the ileocecal valve to the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure).
    - Transverse colon - The transverse colon is intraperitoneal and suspended by the tranverse mesocolon. It extends from the right colic flexure to the left colic flexure.
    - Descending colon - The descending colon is secondarily retroperitoneal and extends from the left colic flexure (splenic flexure) to the left iliac fossa.
    - Sigmoid colon - The sigmoid colon is intraperitoneal, and extends from the left iliac fossa into the rectosigmoid junction. This is when there is loss of the defining features of the large intestine: teniae coli, haustra and omental appendices. This transition occurs at sacral segment 3 (S3).
