### Integrins interact with the extracellular matrix via RGD motif

Integrins is a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate weak cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions.

- ******************************************************Structure and function of Integrins******************************************************
    
    Integrins is a heterodimer with an alpha chain and a beta chain:
    
    - There are 14 known alpha subunits and 8 known beta subunits, and 22 known integrin heterodimers.
    
    Integrins consist of an extracellular binding domain that binds to ECM proteins in a sequence specific manner, via RGD (Arginine-glycine-Aspartate) motif.
    
    The signal is transduced to the intracellular domain that interacts with cytoskeleton to produce a cellular response.

Integrins may interact with other receptors (e.g. DDR) to enhance specificity.
