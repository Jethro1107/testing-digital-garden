### Gas Transport

- Transport of O2
    - **Forms of O2 in blood**
        - Dissolved form - 1.5% (Obeys Henry's Gas Law)
        - Oxyhaemoglobin - 98.5% (subjected to cooperativity)
    - Oxygen content, oxygen capacity, oxygen saturation
        - **Definition oxygen content**
            - Oxygen content refers to the total amount of oxygen in blood, measured as %vol of blood
        - **Definition of oxygen capacity**
            - Oxygen capacity refers to the maximal amount of oxygen bound to haemoglobin, measured as %vol as well
        - **Definition of oxygen saturation**
            - Oxygen saturation refers to the percent saturation of haemoglobin with O2, i.e. Amount of O2 bound to haemoglobin divided by oxygen capacity
    - Oxygen dissociation curve
        - **What is the oxygen dissociation curve? Describe its shape.**
            - Oxygen dissociation curve shows the content of O2 of blood at any time as a function of PO2
            - It is sigmoidal shape due to positive cooperativity
        - **Physiological significance of the shape of the oxygen dissociation curve**
            - When curve is above 60mmHg, the curve is flat, such that decrease in alveolar PO2 has little effect on loading of O2
            - When alveolar PO2 is below 60mmHg, the curve is steep, such that the SpO2 falls significantly for a small drop in PO2, facilitating the unloading of O2 in tissues
        - **Oxygen consumption by peripheral tissues according to O2 dissociation curve**
            - Arterial PO2 of 100 mmHg, results in content of O2 in blood to be 19.7%vol
            - Venous PO2 of 40 mmHg, results in content of O2 in blood to be 14.4%vol
            - The difference of 5.3%vol is the O2 consumption by peripheral tissues
        - **Shape of Oxygen dissociation curve of fetal haemoglobin and its physiological significance**
            - HbF has a much higher O2 affinity than that of HbA, causing a leftward shift of the O2 dissociation curve and making it more sigmoidal
            - This is physiologically significant as it facilitates loading of O2 in a hypoxic fetal environment
            - Furthermore, it drives O2 diffusion across the placenta (steal O2 from HbA of mother)
        - **Factors causing rightward shift in oxygen dissociation curve**
            - Increase in PCO2
            - Decrease in pH
            - Increase in temperature
            - Increase in 2,3-DPG
            - They work by lowering O2 affinity of Hb, facilitating additional unloading of O2 in tissues/ regions with low PO2
        - **Effects of PCO2 on oxygen dissociation curve and its action in tissues and lungs**
            - Bohr's Effect - Effect of PCO2 on oxygen dissociation curve
            - Tissues - increase in PCO2, results in an increase in [H+], which reduces O2 affinity of Hb, resulting in additional unloading of O2 to tissues
            - Lungs - decrease in PCO2, results in a decrease in [H+], which increases O2 affinity of Hb, facilitating loading of O2 to blood
- Transport of CO2
    - **Forms of CO2 in blood**
        - Dissolved CO2 - 10%
        - Bicarbonate ion - 70%
        - Carbamino compounds - 20%
            - Carbaminohaemoglobin (HbHCO2) - 20%
            - Plasma proteins (PrNHCO2) - < 1%
    - CO2 dissociation curve
        - **What is the CO2 dissociation curve? Describe it's shape.**
            - The CO2 dissociation curve shows the content of CO2 in blood at any time as a function of PCO2
            - It is linear
        - **Factors causing leftward shift in CO2 dissociation curve**
            - Decrease in PO2
        - **Effect of PO2 on CO2 dissociation curve and its action in tissue and lungs**
            - Haldane's Effect - Effect of PO2 on CO2 dissociation curve
            - Tissues - low PO2 facilitates loading of CO2 to Hb
            - Lungs - High PO2 facilitates unloading of CO2 from Hb
- Integration of O2 and CO2 transport mechanisms
    - **Interaction of O2 and CO2 transport mechanism in tissue**
        - In tissues, the high PCO2 results in an increase in [H+], reducing O2 affinity of oxygen, facilitating unloading of O2 by Hb to tissues (Bohr's effect)
        - The low PO2 facilitates in the loading of CO2 to Hb (Haldane's effect)
    - **Integration of O2 and CO2 transport mechanism in the lungs**
        - In the lungs, the low PCO2 results in a decrease in [H+], increasing O2 affinity of Hb, facilitating loading of O2 by Hb (Bohr's effect)
        - The high PO2 facilitates the unloading of CO2 from Hb (Haldane's effect)
