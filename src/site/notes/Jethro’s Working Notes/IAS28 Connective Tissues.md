### Composition and General Properties of Connective Tissues

- What is the origin of connective tissues?
    
    Originates from mesenchyme, which develops from the mesoderm
    
    The mesenchyme consist of undifferentiated cells in viscous ground substance, developing into different types of connective tissues
    
    Since cellular junctions are absent in mesenchymal cells, connective tissue cells derived also have no cellular junctions
    
- What are the three types of connective tissues?
    
    Connective tissue proper - in lamina propria, dermis of skin, tendon, ligaments
    
    Specialized connective tissues - cartilage and bones, blood and haematopoietic tissues, Adipose tissues
    
    Embryonic connective tissues - Mesenchyme, mucous connective tissue in umbilical cord
    
- What is the composition of connective tissue?
    
    Cellular components and Extracellular matrix
    
    Cellular components consist of Macrophages, fibroblasts, plasma cells, mast cells and adipocytes
    
    Extracellular matrix is made of fibrous components and ground substance of connective tissues
    
    Blood capillaries are also present
    
- What makes up ground substance?
    
    Ground substances is a gel-like matrix consisting of proteoglycans and glycoproteins
    
    Proteoglycans contains Glycosaminoglycan (long amino sugar chains) covalently attached to a core protein
    
    Sequences and lengths of GAG chains are variable
    
    Glycoproteins contain oligosaccharide (short polysaccharides) chains covalently attached to protein
    
- How may proteoglycan be arranged in hyaline cartilage?
    
    Core protein of proteoglycan attached to hyaluronic acid by link proteins, resulting in a higher level of branching
    
- What are the functions of connective tissues?
    1. Support epithelial tissues - Blood capillaries supply O2 and nutrients to avascular epithelial tissues and remove metabolic wastes from them
    2. Connect tissues/organs - forming ligaments (bone to bone), tendons (muscle to bone)
    3. Protection - Offered by two mechanisms:
        1. Forms effective physical barriers to prevent the spread of infection in the body
        2. Immunedefence cells present protect bodies against infections by immune and inflammatory responses
    4. Involved in tissue repair during wound healing process
    5. ECM regulate the behavior of cells - migration, proliferation, differentiation

### Fibrous Components of Extracellular Matrix

- What are the three major types of fibers in the connective tissue?
    
    Collagen fibers (Type 1: Most abundant type in body)
    
    Reticular fibers (Type 3 collagen)
    
    Elastic fibers
    
- What are collagen fibers?
    
    Collagen - Triple helix of 3 tropocollagen molecules (alpha1, alpha1, alpha2)
    
    Abundant in glycine, proline and hydroxyproline
    
    - Different cells synthesize different types of collagen in different locations of the body. Give examples.
        
        Type 1 collagen in dermis, tendon, ligaments - Fibroblasts
        
        Type 1 collagen in bones - Osteoblast
        
        Type 2 collagen in hyaline cartilage - Chondroblasts
        
        Type 3 collagen (Reticular Fibres) in reticular lamina - Fibroblasts
        
        Type 4 collagen in Basal lamina - Epithelial cells
        
        Type 7 collagen in Basement membrane to anchor epithelium to basement membrane - Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts

- What are reticular fibres?
    
    Reticular fibres are extremely fine fibrils made up mainly of type 3 collagen
    
    They form extensive network to support soft organs
    
    - What staining are reticular fibres visible under?
        
        Not visible under conventional H & E staining
        
        Visible by silver stain since they are argyrophilic
        
        Visible in PAS staining due to high content of glycoproteins
        
- What are elastic fibres?
    
    Elastic fibres are stretchable fibres, consisting of an amorphous core of elastin surrounded by microfibrils (fibrillin)
    
    - Can Elastic fibres be visualized under H&E staining?
        
        No, difficult to stain
        
- What are the different types of connective tissues by arrangement of fibrous components?
    
    Loose (areolar) connective tissue - Lamina propria, mesentery, Whartonâ€™s jelly
    
    Dense connective tissue:
    
    Dense irregular - Dermis
    
    Dense regular - tendon, ligaments, aponeurosis
    
- Identify the connective tissues

### Cell Types in Connective Tissues

- What are the cell types present?
    
    Fibroblasts, macrophages, plasma cells, mast cells, adipocytes
    
- What are Fibroblasts?
    
    Most common cell type in connective tissue
    
    Responsible for synthesis of fibrous component and the ground substance
    
    Involved in response to tissue damage & synthesis of new matrix
    
    Responsible for formation of scar tissue during wound healing
    
- What is the difference between fibroblasts and fibrocytes?
    
    Fibroblasts are the active form while fibrocytes are inactive form
    
- What are macrophages?
    
    Phagocytes involved in innate immune response (non-specific)
    
    Derived from circulating monocytes
    
    Large size with irregular surface
    
    Abundant lysosomes for digestion
    
    Involved in antigen presentation to lymphocytes (adaptive immune response)
    
- Describe the process of antigen presentation by macrophage to lymphocytes
    
    Antigen engulfed by macrophage by endocytosis
    
    Vesicle formed fuse with lysosome, lysosomal enzymes digest antigen into epitope
    
    Epitope combines with Class II MHC protein and is presented on the surface
    
    Epitope on MHC II protein binds to receptors in lymphocytes
    
- What are Plasma cells?
    
    Antibody-producing cells differentiated from B lymphocytes upon activation
    
    Oval in shape with clock face nucleus eccentrically located (reside on one side)
    
    Prominent Golgi apparatus and abundant rER (abundant ribsomes hence basophilic)
    
- What are Mast cells?
    
    Responsible for allergic reactions
    
    Large and oval in shape
    
    Metachromasia - Converts toluidine blue dye to purple red
    
    Metachromatic granules containing heparin and histamine
    
    IgE on cell surface mediate activation and degranulation of mast cells to induce acute inflammation
    
- Describe the process of activation and degranulation of mast cells.
    
    Antigen/Allergen bind to IgE on surface of mast cells, activation and degranulation occurs, metachromatic granules containing Heparin and Histamine trigger allergic reactions and acute inflammation
    
- What are the two types of adipose tissues?
    
    Multilocular adipose tissues:
    
    cytologically multiple small lipid droplets
    
    Many mitochondria, thus responsible for  transforming fat to heat
    
    High density of blood vessels
    
    Unilocular adipose tissues:
    
    cytologically one large lipid droplet
    
    Mainly for accumulation and mobilization of lipids
    
    Mixed adipose tissues present also
    
    Multilocular adipose tissue abudant in newborn infant, but amount decrease with age
