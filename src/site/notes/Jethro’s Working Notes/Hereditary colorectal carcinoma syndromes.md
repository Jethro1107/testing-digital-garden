### Hereditary colorectal carcinoma syndromes

There are two familial colorectal carcinoma syndromes: 1) Familial adenomatous polyposis, and 2) Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or lynch syndrome)

- **Familial adenomatous polyposis**
    
    Familial adenomatous polyposis involves the inheritance of a defective APC gene in an autosomal dominant fashion. By the 2nd to 3rd decade of life, the colon is carpeted by hundreds of adenomatous polyps ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Colonic adenoma\|Colonic adenoma]]).
    
    There >90% chance of development into [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Colorectal carcinoma\|Colorectal carcinoma]] by 50 years old.
    
- **Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer**
    
    HPNCC involves the inheritance of MSH2 or MLH1 gene (both involved in DNA mismatch repair pathway) in an autosomal dominant fashion.
    
    It is associated with colorectal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Neoplasia of the stomach\|Neoplasia of the stomach]]), **but with no polyps formed**.
