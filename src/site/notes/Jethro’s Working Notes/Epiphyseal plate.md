### Epiphyseal plate

The epiphyseal plate separates the secondary ossification centre and the primary ossification centre in a growing long bone.

- ******************It is separated into 5 zones******************
    1. Zone of resting cartilage - which consist of normal hyaline cartilage.
    2. Proliferative zone - Consist of rapidly proliferating chondrocytes that form columns of stacked cells along the long axis of bone
    3. Hypertrophic cartilage zone - Chondrocytes undergoes hypertrophy
    4. Calcified cartilage zone - Death of chondrocytes and subsequent calcification of cartilage
    5. Ossification zone - Osteoclasts come in to resorb the cartilage matrix, with penetration of osteogenic buds to lay down new bone.
