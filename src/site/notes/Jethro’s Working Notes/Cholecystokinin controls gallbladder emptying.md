### Cholecystokinin controls gallbladder emptying

While bile is continuously produced by hepatocytes and modified by cholangiocytes, most of it is stored in the gallbladder.

Cholecystokinin is released by I cells of the duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa. It stimulates the rhythmic contraction of gallbladder and the relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. This enables the delivery of stored bile into the duodenum.
