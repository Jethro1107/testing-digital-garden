### Intrinsic factor secretion in the stomach

Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein secreted by parietal cells in the stomach. It is vital for the transportation of vitamin B12 and the absorption of vitamin B12 by the terminal ileum.

- **Regulation of intrinsic factor secretion**
    
    Intrinsic factor secretion is regulated by the same substances that regulate acid secretion ([[The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine\|The basic factors that stimulate gastric acid secretion are acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine]]).
