### Gastrointestinal infections

Approach to gastrointestinal infections:

- There are different gastrointestinal infective syndromes, each with a specific group of microbes that cause the syndromes.
- The incubation period, symptomatology and exposure history enables us to delineate the infective syndromes and thus narrow down the etiological microbe.
- A number of investigations is carried out for [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Microbiological diagnosis of Enteric Infections\|Microbiological diagnosis of Enteric Infections]].

Classification of gastrointestinal infections:

- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Non-inflammatory enteric infections\|Non-inflammatory enteric infections]]  - Vomiting, Watery Diarrhoea
    - Non-inflammatory gastrointestinal infections are enterotoxin (particularly secretory toxin) mediated. As it does not involve an inflammatory response, leukocyte is negative on stool examination.
- [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Inflammatory enteric infections\|Inflammatory enteric infections]] - Dysentery, Bloody diarrhea
- Penetrating enteric infections - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Enteric fever\|Enteric fever]]
- Antibiotic-associated diarrhea - Etiology can be non-infective (caused by the antibiotic) or infective, commonly caused by Clostridium difficicle ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clostridium difficile colitis\|Clostridium difficile colitis]]).
