### Wilson and Junger’s 10 criteria for screening

**********************************************************************We can’t screen for every disease, so which disease should we screen?********************************************************************** Wilson and Junger established 10 basic criterias for screening, that focuses on the knowledge of the disease, knowledge of the test, treatment of the disease and the the cost-effectiveness of screening. This ensures that there is an exact actionable plan (diagnosis and treatment) that is beneficial in the long run.

- ************************The criterias************************
    
    Knowledge of the disease:
    
    - The disease is an important health problem
    - There is a recognizable latent or early symptomatic disease
    - The **********************natural history********************** of the condition, including the development from latent to declared disease should be adequately understood
    
    Knowledge of the test:
    
    - There should be a suitable test
    - The test should be acceptable to the population
    - Case findings should be continuous
    
    Treatment of a disease:
    
    - There should be an accepted treatment for patients with declared disease
    - Facilitates for diagnosis and treatment should be available
    - There should be agreed policy for who should be treated as patients
    
    Cost-effectiveness:
    
    - The cost of case-finding (including diagnosis and treatment of patients diagnosed) should be economically balanced in relation to possible expenditure on medical care as a whole
