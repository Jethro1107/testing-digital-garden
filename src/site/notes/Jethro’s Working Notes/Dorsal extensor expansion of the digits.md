### Dorsal extensor expansion of the digits

When the tendons of the extensor digitorum and extensor pollicus longus ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Posterior compartment of the forearm\|Posterior compartment of the forearm]]) pass on the dorsal aspect of the digits, at the level of the proximal phalanges, they expand to form the extensor expansion, which is a specialised triangular shaped connective tissue.

Its apex is at the base of the distal phalanx, while its base covers the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Note that the extensor digiti minimi, extensor indicis, and some intrinsic muscles insert to the extensor expansion of the digits, enabling expansion of the digits.
