### Bacteria Cell Structure

- What are the common structures present in a bacteria?
    
    Cytoplasm - Ribosome, DNA, plasmids
    
    Plasma membrane
    
    Cell Wall
    
    Capsule
    
    Pili, fimbriae, flagella
    
    Endospores (maybe present, usually in G+ bacteria)
    
- Describe the structure of the peptidoglycan cell wall.
    
    Peptidoglycan are structures formed by many layers of glycan chains held together by amino acid cross link
    
    A glycan chain consists of alternating subunits of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)
    
    Adjacent glycan chains are held together by peptide interbridges between tetrapeptide chains on NAM molecules
    
- What are the differences between a Gram-positive bacteria and a Gram-negative bacteria?
    
    Peptidoglycan - Thicker in G+ bacteria
    
    Outer membrane - In G- bacteria only, reducing permeability to antibiotics, possess Lipids, polysaccharides, LPS and lipoproteins
    
- What is the structure and function of the lipopolysaccharide? In what type of bacteria is it present?
    
    LPS is a structure made of lipids and polysaccharides, the polysaccharides forming the O antigen is exposed on the bacteria interior, and the lipid faces the interior
    
    LPS contains a O antigen which stimulates an immune response
    
    LPS is only present in G- bacteria as it is only present in the outer membrane
    
- Describe the steps to a gram stain.
    
    Add crystal violet to stain the peptidoglycan
    
    Add iodine as a stabilizing agent to fix crystal violet to peptidoglycan
    
    Add alcohol to wash away crystal violet stain. As the crystal violet does not stain well to the thin peptidoglycan layer on G- bacteria, G- bacteria becomes colourless
    
    Add Safranin to stain G- bacteria red
    
- What are the features of acid fast bacilli? Describe the process staining an acid-fast bacilli.
    
    Example: Mycobacterium, Nocardia
    
    Acid fast bacilli have thick mycolic acid layer on surface with high lipid content, which makes it difficult for stains to penetrate
    
    They cannot be gram stained
    
    It helps mycobacteria to survive in the environment, defend against body immunity and resist action of disinfectants
    
    Acid-fastness is the physical property that gives bacterium the ability to resist decolourization by an acid after staining
    
    1. Apply primary stain of carbolfuschin for 30 seconds
    2. Heat to promote uptake of carbolfuschin and fix cells to slide
    3. Decolorize with acid alcohol
    4. Counterstain with methylene blue
- What is the structure of bacterial spores?
    
    Spore - Bacterial DNA
    
    Spore membrane
    
    Spore peptidoglycan
    
    Spore coat
    
- How does bacterial spores differ from bacteria?
    
    Metabolically inert/dormancy
    
    Have survival advantages, e.g. Resistance to heat, chemicals and radiation
    
    Can survive disinfection and sterilization processes
    

### Bacterial Classification

- What are the ways of classifying bacteria?
    
    By comparing staining characteristics - G+, G-, Cell wall deficient
    
    By shape - Cocci in clusters, Cocci in chains, Diplococci, Bacilli (straight, curved), Spirochaetes 
    
    By oxygen requirement for growth - Strictly aerobic, Facultatively anaerobic, Strictly anaerobic, microaerophilic
    

### The Human Microbiome

- What are other names for the human microbiome?
    
    Normal flora, normal microbiota, commensals
    
- What are the functions of the human microbiome?
    
    Development of normal immune system - learn to differentiate self and foreign antigens
    
    Colonization resistance - prevent colonization of pathogens by depleting nutrients
    
    Contribute to nutrition - Vitamin K
    
- What are important natural flora found in the skin, nose, mouth, colon, vagina and urethra?
- Compare resident flora and transient flora.
    
    Resident flora - Permanent residents of the associated body sites under normal circumstances
    
    Transient flora - Not part of the normal microbiota, but may temporarily be found colonizing the host, whereas the host is asymptomatic
    
- Compare infection and colonization and their clinical implications.
    
    Infection - Invasion into normally sterile sites coupled with host reactions
    
    Colonization - Presence of microbes but with absence of symptoms or clinical manifestations of illness or infection
    

### Pathogenesis

- What is a pathogen?
    
    A microbe, agent, factor or process capable of causing disease
    
- What is a communicable disease?
    
    A disease whose causal agent can be transmitted from successive host to healthy subjects, from one individual to another
    
- What is infectivity?
    
    The characteristic of a disease agent that embodies the capacity to invade, survive and multiply in the host
    
- What is pathogenicity/virulence?
    
    The degree or the power of a microbe to produce disease
    
- What are the different pathogenic mechanisms of bacteria?
    
    Direct cytolysis - Intracellular multiplication
    
    Toxins - Dipthrenia, Tetanus, Bostulism, Bacillary dysentery, Cholera. These are the classical examples of toxin-mediated infections.
    
    immunopathological damage
    
    Oncogenesis
    
- What are the steps to diagnose a bacterial infection?
    
    Clinical diagnosis
    
    Appropriate specimen collection
    
    Laboratory diagnosis - Microscopy, Culture, Biochemical test on colony, Antigen/Antibody detection, Nucleic acid amplification and sequencing, Histopathology
    
    Antibiotic susceptibility testing
    
- How are bacterial infections managed?
    
    Treatment
    
    Supportive treatment
    
    Antibiotics
    
    Immunological therapy - Neutralization of toxins, Modification of host immune system
    
    Prevention
    
    Interrupt chain of transmission
    
    Passive and active immunization
