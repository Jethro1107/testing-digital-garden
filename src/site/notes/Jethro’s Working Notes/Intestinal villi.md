### Intestinal villi

Intestinal villi are outgrowths of the mucosa in the small intestine. They are made of a core of loose connective tissue (lamina propria) lined by a simple columnar epithelium.

- **Cell types of simple columnar epithelium**
    
    The simple columnar epithelium consist of 2 cell types: 1) Enterocytes and 2) Goblet cells.
    
    Enterocytes are simple columnar cells, that consist of microvilli on its apical surface to form a brush border (i.e. consisting of a microvilli brush border). They are absorptive cells.
    
    Goblet cells are mucous secreting cells. They have a wine-glass shape, with the nucleus in the basal region (handle region) and a pale-staining apical region (due to presence of poorly-stained mucinogen molecules).

    - The number of goblet cells increase from duodenum to ilium.
- **Structure of the core of loose connective tissue**
    
    The core of loose connective tissue consist of a central lacteal (a lymph capillary that aids lipid and lymph absorption) and fenestrated capillaries involved in absorption of other nutrients.
