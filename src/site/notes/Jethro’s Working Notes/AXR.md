### Plain AXR

Plain abdominal X Ray may reveals the anatomy of the GI tract, and is useful for diganosis of small bowel obstruction and sigmoid volvulus ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Intestinal obstruction\|Intestinal obstruction]]).

- ************************************************************************Normal features of an AXR************************************************************************
    
    When accessing a plain AXR, 3 things are accessed: Gas patterns, fluid levels and the caliber of the bowel.
    
    **************************************Normal gas patterns**************************************
    
    - Gas is normally present in the stomach.
    - For non-distended small bowel, 2-3 loops of small bowel may be present.
    - For large bowel, gas is usually present in the sigmoid colon and rectum.
    
    ******************************************************Caliber of bowel (diameter)******************************************************
    
    - The upper limits of caliber of bowel is 3cm for small bowel, 6cm for colon and 9cm for cecum.
    
    ************************Fluid levels************************
    
    On erect view:
    
    - Fluid levels is usually present in the stomach.
    - There may be 2-3 fluid levels in the small bowel.
    - Fluid levels is usually absent in the large bowels.
    
    On supine view, there is no fluid levels.

- **************************************Signs of small bowel obstruction**************************************
    
    The 3 signs of small bowel obstruction is:
    
    - Dilated small bowel
    - Multiple fluid levels on erect view of plain AXR
    - Paucity (lack) of colon gas due to the obstruction

- **************************************************Signs of sigmoid volvolus**************************************************
    1. Dilated sigmoid colon
    2. Faeces in dilated bowel arising from pelvis

- ************************************************Limitations of plain AXR************************************************
    
    Plain AXR is unable to:
    
    - Evaluate mucosal lesions
    - Demonstrate motility and leaks
    - Delineate level of obstruction
    
    When required, perform contrast (barium) studies
    

### Barium studies (Contrast AXR)

There are 5 types of barium studies:

- ****************************Barium swallow****************************
    
    Barium swallow investigates [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pathology of the esophagus\|Pathology of the esophagus]].
    
    The patient is then asked to first swallow baking soda crystals, providing a gas contrast that dilates the esophagus, followed by drinking a barium swallow. Plain AXR is then produced in erect view.

- **********Barium meal**********
    
    Barium meal is used to investigate [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pathology of the stomach\|Pathology of the stomach]].
    
    Patient is asked to fast for 6 hours before procedure.
    
    Patient is asked to take a baking sodal crystal to dilate the stomach, followed by drinking barium contrast. Plain AXR is taken in supine view.

- ****************Barium follow through****************
    
    Barium follow studies pathology of the small bowel, and is often followed immediately after barium meals and barium swallow.
    
    Patient is asked to take laxative the day before, and fast for 6 hours before the procedure.
    
    Patient drinks barium continuously until it reaches the colon.

- **********************************Small bowel enema**********************************
    
    Small bowel enema involves inserting a tube through the GI tract into the 4th part of duodenum, with the subsequent release of barium contrast into small bowel.
    
- ************************Barium enema************************
    
    Barium enema is used for investigation pathologies of the large bowel.
    
    Patient is asked to take laxative and clear fluid 1 day before examination, with colonic washout with tepid water on day of examination to clense the bowel with faeces.
    
    A single contrast (barium contrast) or double contrast (barium contrast followed by air contrast) is used.

- CT
    - Clinical significance of anatomical position of pancreas
        - Pancreas is retroperitoneal, and in close association with the superior mesenteric vessels and the splenic veins.
        - Pancreatic cancer resectability depends on whether there is superior mesenteric vessel invasion, or portal vein invasion
        - Whipple procedure (pancreatoduodenectomy) - resection of the the head of the pancreas, entire duodenum, gallbladder and bile duct - for treatment of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma
    - Clinical significance of liver
        - Liver receives dual blood supply - hepatic artery proper, and portal vein, union of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein (hence on CT, we first see the portal vein, then followed by the 2 tributaries
        - 3 hepatic veins - right, middle and left, drains into IVC intrahepatic, Middle hepatic vein separates left and right lobe
        - CT of cirrhotic vs normal liver
            - Nodular liver (lumpy bumpy surfaces)
            - Portosystemic collateral pathways developed - recanalised umbilical vein in fissure for ligamentum teres
