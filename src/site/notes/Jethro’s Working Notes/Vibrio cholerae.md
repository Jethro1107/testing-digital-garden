### Vibrio cholerae

- **Classification of Vibrio cholerae**
    
    
    V. Cholerae is classified into 3 serotypes (by the antigens present):
    
    O1, O139, and Non O1 non O139
    
    O1 further classified into two biotypes (by biochemical properties):
    
    Classical and El Tor (most cases)
    
    Classical and El Tor O1 V. cholerae are further classified into Ogawa and Inaba serotypes

    It should be noted that Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 serotypes cause severe diseases, and have epidemic potentials. 
    
    Vibro cholerae non-O1, non-O139 usually cause sporadic cases of diarrhea.
    
- **Transmission of Vibrio cholerae**
    
    Vibrio cholerae can be transmitted via water-borne transmission (remember the history of Vibrio cholerae), via food-borne transmission (in contaminated seafood), or person-to-person transmission.
    

### Cholera

- **Pathogenesis of Cholera**
    
    Cholera, a diarrhoea associated with Vibrio cholerae, is mediated by *cholera toxin*.
    
    Cholera toxin binds to enterocytes in crypt cells, which results in an increase in cAMP levels, resulting in activation of CFTR. This increases Cl- secretion, resulting in excess fluid secretion ([[Fluid secretion by crypt cells is mediated by a Cl- dependent mechanism\|Fluid secretion by crypt cells is mediated by a Cl- dependent mechanism]]).
    
- **Clinical presentation of Cholera**
    
    Incubation period of Vibrio cholerae can last up to 5 days.
    
    It classically presents as Cholera gravis, a very profuse watery diarrhoea (rice water stool), leaving the patients severely dehyrated.
    
    Patients may have milder presentations.
    
- **Diagnosis of cholera**
    
    Clinical suspicion is required.
    
    Microbial diagnosis of cholera via stool culture on TCBS medium ([[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/TCBS medium differentiates Vibrio species\|TCBS medium differentiates Vibrio species]]), which grows yellow colonies.

- **Management of cholera**
    
    *Fluid and electrolyte replacement*. As in other forms of diarrhoea, fluid and electrolyte replacement is key in management. This can be performed by Oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy ([[Physiological basis of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy\|Physiological basis of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy]]), or intravenous infusion.
    
    *Antibiotic therapy*. Tetracyclines and ciprofloxacin commonly used. This shortens the disease duration and avoids excessive water loss.
    
- **Prevention of cholera**
    
    Boiling of drinking water.
    
    Vaccines is available for travellers.
