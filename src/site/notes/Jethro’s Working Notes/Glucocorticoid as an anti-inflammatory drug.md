### Glucocorticoid

Synthetic glucocorticoid, at therapeutic doses, can serve as an anti-inflammatory drug. Relative to it’s counterpart, [[Jethro’s Working Notes/NSAID\|NSAID]], it is a steroid.

- ****Examples of glucocorticoid****
    
    Synthetic glucocorticoids can be classified by their duration of action:
    
    Short and intermediate-acting glucocorticoids:
    
    - Hydrocortisone, Prednisolone - They are active drugs.
    - Cortisone, prednisone - They are prodrugs that are bio-activated in the liver by 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11B-HSD1) into their active forms, hydrocortisone and prednisolone respectively.
    
    Long-acting glucocorticoids:
    
    - Betamethasone, Dexamethasone
    - There is limited use for oral therapy of long-acting glucocorticoids due to the adverse effects, but usually used for topical therapy.
- **********************************************MOA of glucocorticoid as an anti-inflammatory drug**********************************************
    
    Anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoid is achieved at high doses (therapeutic doses), but not at the normal levels of glucocorticoids in our body, hence, anti-inflammation is not a physiological function of glucocorticoid as a hormone.
    
    Glucocorticoids diffuse into cells and bind to glucocorticoid receptors.
    
    - The hormone-receptor complex then translocates into the nucleus, where it serves as a transcription factor that regulate (stimulate or repress) expression of certain genes.
        
        The modulation on protein synthesis being its MOA implies the slow onset of action of synthetic glucocorticoids.
        
    
    Glucocorticoid mediates its anti-inflammatory effects by stimulating or inhibiting certain genes:
    
    - It stimulates the expression of Lipocortin (Annexin-1), which inhibits phospholipase A2, which is required for conversion of membrane phospholipids into arachidonic acid, thus suppressing eicosinoid production.
    - It inhibits the expression of inducible cycloxygenase (COX-2), thus inhibiting prostanoid synthesis and inflammation ([[Prostanoid lies central to the inflammatory response\|Prostanoid lies central to the inflammatory response]]).

    - It also targets more upstream inflammatory pathways, by inhibiting synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1.

    Its overall anti-inflammatory effects include:
    
    - Inhibition of production of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and platelet activating factors
    - Reduced vascular permeability and vasoconstriction due to inhibiting production of prostaglandins
    - Inhibit interaction of white blood cell adhesion molecules with those on endothelial cells, thus inhibiting emigration into tissues
    - Inhibiting macrophage and other antigen-presenting cells functions, e.g. phagocytosis, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced T cell activation
- ****Adverse effects of chronic use of glucocorticoids****
    
    The adverse effects of chronic use of glucocorticoid is related to the physiological effects of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Glucocorticoid as a hormone\|Glucocorticoid as a hormone]]:
    
    - Risk of infection and [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peptic ulcer\|Peptic ulcer]]s
    - Impaired wound healing
    - CNS disturbance - initially insomnia and euphoria, and later depression
    - Osteoporosis
    - Metabolic effects of glucocorticoids:
        - Hyperglycemia, resulting in [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]]
        - Muscle wasting due to protein catabolism in extrahepatic tissues
        - Redistribution of fat to the trunk
- ************************************************************Precautions of glucocorticoids************************************************************
    
    Glucocorticoids is avoided in children due to growth inhibition with chronic use.
    
    It is also generally avoided in certain pre-existing condition:
    
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Peptic ulcer\|Peptic ulcer]]
    - Heart disease
    - Infectious disease
    - Psychosis
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]]
    - Osteoporosis
    - Hepatic failure
- **********************************************************************************************Graded reduction of glucocorticoids is required**********************************************************************************************
    
    Chronic use of glucocorticoid results in a supressed HPA axis ([[Cortisol secretion is tightly regulated in the Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\|Cortisol secretion is tightly regulated in the Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]]), which results in adrenal insufficiency.
    
    Sudden withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy may cause insufficient cortisol in blood, which results in:
    
    - Disturbances in fluid and electrolyte balances
    - Hypoglycemia
    - Attenuated effects of other hormones, such as catacholamines, which may result in circulatory shock due to impaired vasoactive response to catacholamines.
    
    Hence, a graded reduction of glucocorticoid therapy is required, which takes a long time:
    
    - 2-12 months of recovery of adrenal functions, followed by,
    - Another 6-9 months for recovery of corticosteroid levels.
