### Bone repair

Similar to the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/4 phases of healing\|4 phases of healing]], bone repair (or fracture repair) also consist of 4 phases:

1. Hematoma formation
2. Inflammation stage
3. Proliferation phase
    
    Cells in the periosteum and endosteum proliferate intensely, and form a fibrocartilage tissue that bridges the fracture called soft callus.
    
    Via [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Endochondral ossification\|Endochondral ossification]], the soft callus is replaced with primary bone tissue, forming a hard callus.
    
    The callus is in general wider than the fracture, providing stability.
    
4. Remodelling phase
    
    The hard callus is subsequently remodelled into secondary bone, and into original bone shape.
