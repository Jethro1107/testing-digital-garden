### Surface mucous cells and neck mucus cells are involved in the maintaenance of a two-layered mucous gel layer

Surface mucous cells release MUC5AC, whereas neck mucous cells release MUC6, both of which produces a viscous mucus gel layer that coats the entire gastric mucosa.

The mucous gel layer is made of 2 sublayers, the loosely adherent outer layer and the firmly adherent inner layer.

The loosely adherent outer layer is constantly rubbed off and mixed with gastric contents, but the firmly adherent inner layer offers important protective functions:

- **The mucous cells release bicarbonate into the firmly adherent mucous layer, creating a pH gradient from lumen to mucosa.**
- The bicarbonate in the firmly adherent mucous layer titrates the H+ that diffuse back across the mucous gel layer. This protects the gastric mucosa from corrosive acid.
- The high pH of of the firmly adherent gel layer irreversibly inactivates pepsin ([[Pepsinogen is an inactive zymogen released by chief cells\|Pepsinogen is an inactive zymogen released by chief cells]]). This protects the gastric mucosa from penetrated pepsin.
