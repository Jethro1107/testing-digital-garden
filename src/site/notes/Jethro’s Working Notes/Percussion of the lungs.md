# Percussion of the lungs

### Clinical skills - Percussion of the lungs

**Technique -** When percussing, place the middle finger on the intercostal space, and try to spread the skin with the other fingers to increase tension. Lightly tap the middle finger with the other hand with a wrist swinging motion. A technique I discovered is to percuss lightly. It is easier to differentiate between something (resonance in the lungs) and nothing (dullness in the liver or cardiac areas)

Percussion should involve both lung apices (in the supraclavicular fossa), both clavicles, and intercostal spaces both anteriorly and posteriorly. When percussing anteriorly, one should also percuss the axillary region (lateral side).

- 3 sounds of lung percussion and associated conditions
    
    Hyperesonance - Pneumothorax, emphysema
    
    Dullness (Normal cardiac dullness, liver dullness) -  Pleural effusion, consolidations or lung collapse
    
    Tympany
    
- Assessing areas of dullness
    
    If the upper border of liver dullness (normally right 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line) is depressed, or areas of cardiac dullness is deminished, hyperinflation (due to emphysema or asthma) is indicated.
