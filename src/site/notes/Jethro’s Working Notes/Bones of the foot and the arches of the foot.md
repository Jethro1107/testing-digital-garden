### Bones of the foot

3 sets of bones form the bony framework of the foot:

- Tarsals - consisting of 2 large tarsal bones and 5 small tarsal bones
- Metatarsals, forming the bones of the metatarsus
- Phalanges, forming the bones of the digits - 2 in the big toe (proximal and distal) and 3 in the rest of the digit.
- **2 large tarsal bones**
    
    The 2 large tarsal bones are the lateral calcaneus and the medial tallus.
    
    The calcaneus forms the heel.
    
    The tallus sits on top of the calcaneus and is involved in the ankle joint.

- **5 small tarsal bones**
    
    The navicular is a boat shaped bone that is that articulates with the anterior surface of the tallus.
    
    The 3 cuneiforms (lateral, intermediate and medial cuniforms) lies in front of the navicular.
    
    The lateral cuboid lies in front of the calcaneus.

Note the tuberosity of the 5th metatarsal, near its base, which is palpable.

### Arches of the foot

The bones of the foot forms 3 arches:

- The medial longitudinal arch
- The lateral longitudinal arch
- The transverse arch

The medial longitudinal arch is much more pronounced than the lateral longitudinal arch, think footprints on the sand.

- **Functions of arches of the foot**
    
    It enables springiness of the foot.
    
    It also enables weight distribution between the calcaneus and the balls of the foot.
