# What happens in quiet inspiration and expiration?

Inspiration:

Contraction of diaphragm causes the increase in height of the thoracic cavity

Contraction of the intercostal muscles causes the increase anterior posterior diameter and transverse diameter 

This increases the negative intrathoracic pressure, causing the lung to expand

Expiration:

Relaxation of the diaphragm causes a decrease in height of the thoracic cavity

Relaxation of the intercostal muscles cause the decrease in AP diameter and TD

This allows the intrathoracic pressure to return normal, allowing the elastic recoil of the lungs
