### **What is rapidly progressive cresentic glomerulonephritis?**

Rapidly progressive cresentic glomerulonephritis is a clinical syndrome associated with severe glomerular injury, but does not denote a specific etiology

### **Types of rapidly progressive cresentic glomerulonephritis**

- Anti-GBM antibody mediated disease (Type I)
    - Goodpasture syndrome (Anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis)
        - **Etiology of goodpasture syndrome**
            
            Autoantibodies against the NC1 domain of alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen
            
            Usually cross react with pulmonary alveolar basement membrane, causing pulmonary haemorrhage and death
            
            Exact trigger of autoantibodies is unclear, but usually preceded by flu-like illness or hydrocarbon solvent exposure
            
        - **Glomerular pathology in goodpasture syndrome**
            
            Light microscopy - GBM break, cellular crescents in bowman’s space (due to proliferation of epithelial cells and leukocyte infiltrates), fibrin deposition

            Immunofluorescence microscopy - linear IgG deposits along GBM

            Electron microscopy - no deposits as antibodies are too small to detect, GBM disruption
            
        - **Treatment of goodpasture syndrome**
            
            Plasmapheresis - to wash out autoantibodies
            
            High dose steroids and cyclophosphamide
            
        - **Outcome of goodpasture syndrome**
            
            Many develop ESRD, requiring renal replacement therapy
            
- Immune complex mediated (Type II)
    
    e.g. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis/ PSGN, Lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, Henoch-Scholein purpura
    
- Pauci-immune (Type III)
    
    ANCA-associated
