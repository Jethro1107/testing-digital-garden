### Radial artery

The radial artery is a branch of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Brachial artery\|Brachial artery]].

- **In the forearm**
    
    The radial artery descends deep to the brachioradialis, which accompanies the superficial branch of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Radial nerve\|Radial nerve]]. At the distal forearm, it lies lateral to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis.
    
- ******************************************In the wrist and hand******************************************
    
    In the wrist, it gives rise to the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery which anastamose with the [[superficial palmar arch of the ulnar artery\|superficial palmar arch of the ulnar artery]], where the radial artery continues and crosses beneath the tendons of the abductor pollicus longus and extensor pollicus brevis, and reappears in the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Anatomical snuffbox\|Anatomical snuffbox]].

    The radial artery then continues as the deep palmar arch.
