### Salivary alpha-amylase and pancreatic alpha-amylase are involved in the digestion of starch

- **In the oral cavity:**
    
    In the oral cavity, salivary glands ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Histology of the main salivary glands\|Histology of the main salivary glands]]) release salivary alpha-amylase, which cleaves alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds within starch. 
    
    However, alpha-amylase does not cleave terminal alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds, i.e. it does not cleave the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bond in maltose.
    
    The resultant products include maltose, maltotriose, isomaltose and alpha-dextrins.
    
- **In the stomach:**
    
    Salivary alpha-amylase is inactivated by gastric acid. Digestion of carbohydrates is halted in the stomach.
    
- **Upon entry in the duodenum (small intestine):**
    
    The pancreas ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Histology of the pancreas\|Histology of the pancreas]]) release pancreatic alpha-amylase, which further cleave remaining alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds.
    
    The resultant product include maltose, isomaltose and maltotriose.
