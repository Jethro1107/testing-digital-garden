# Cardiovascular examination

The cardiovascular examination consist of 4 parts: 1) General inspection of the patient, 2) Examination of arterial pulse 3) Examination of jugular venous pressure, and 4) Precordial examination.

### General examination

During general examination, it is better to first inspect the body habitus, then proceed down the body of the patient, proceeding cranially to caudally.

**Body habitus**

Marfan’s syndrome

Down’s syndrome

Turner’s syndrome

**Head**

Eyes - Certain signs should be assessed:

1. Conjunctival pallor (reflecting anaemia)
2. Sclera for Jaundice (reflecting congestive heart failure and underlying hepatic congestion)
3. Xanthelasma - deposition of lipids around the eye (reflecting hypercholesteremia)

Tongue - Central cyanosis should be assessed ([[Jethro’s Working Notes/Central cyanosis is always pathological\|Central cyanosis is always pathological]])

**Hands**

**Inspection** - Three things should be inspected on the hands:

1. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Clubbing\|Clubbing]] 
2. Signs of infective endocarditis (Osler’s nodes, Janeway lesions, Splinter haemorrhage)
3. Xanthomas (deposition of lipids in hand joints or around the elbows)

**Palpation** - of the radial pulse:

- Palpate radial pulse bilaterally, assessing for rate, rhythm, character and volume
- When palpating the radial pulse bilaterally, check for radial-radial delay
- Radial-femoral pulse should be assessed

**Legs**

When inspecting the legs, three things should be assessed:

1. [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Pitting oedema\|Pitting oedema]] 
2. Signs of deep vein thrombosis
3. Signs of varicose veins

### Examination of the arterial system/ Examination of arterial pulse

3 arterial pulses should be used when assessing the arterial system: 1) Radial pulse, 2) Brachial pulse, 3) Carotid pulse

**Radial pulse**

The radial pulse is used to assess the rate and rhythm, as well as the presence of radial-radial delay or radial-femoral delay, which is usually performed in general examination.

Character and volume can also be assessed at the radial pulse, particularly for a collapsing pulse and pulsus alternans.

**Carotid pulse**

**Palpation** of the carotid pulse can also be used to assess rate and rhythm, as well as the character and volume.

**Auscultation** - The carotid pulse is auscultated as a part of the precordial examination.

**Brachial pulse**

### Examination of the venous system/ Examination of the jugular venous pressure

The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Jugular venous pressure\|Jugular venous pressure]] is assessed for its height and character.

### Clinical skills - Assessing the jugular venous pressure

Positioning and lighting is important for assessing the jugular venous pressure.

**Positioning the patient**

The patient lies at 45 degrees (By having the patient lying at a 45 degree angle, the base of the neck is roughly aligned with the sternal angle).

The patient turns his head slightly to the left to expose the base of the neck. However, if the patient’s head is turned too much, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is contracted and obscure the view.

**Assessing jugular venous pressure**

The JVP is assessed for its height and character.

1. Height
    
    The height of JVP is determined by the vertical distance between the highest point of JVP pulsation and the sternal angle, then adding 5cm (The vertical distance between the sternal angle and the right atrium is roughly 5cm). Normal JVP
    
2. Character
    
    A normal JVP waveform has a bifid flickering character, i.e. it has 2 pulses within one cardiac cycle ([[Guyton and Hall  Atrial a, c and p wave\|Guyton and Hall  Atrial a, c and p wave]] ):
    
    An A wave and a V wave
    

Abnormal height and character underlie certain cardiac problems (Cf: [[$ Talley  Causes of change in jugular venous pressure height and character\|$ Talley  Causes of change in jugular venous pressure height and character]])

### Precordial examination

Precordial examination involves 3 components: 1) Inspection, 2) Palpation and 3) Auscultation

**Inspection**

Inspect for scars (in the axillary region and chest) or other chest wall deformities

Inspect for any visible apex beat or abnormal impulses

**Palpation**

Palpate for the apex beat:

- Normally, the apex beat is located at left 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line
- The apex beat is a localised tapping, early systolic outward thrust
- Abnormal character of apex beat
    - Heaving (pressure overload) - a displaced, forceful, sustained impulse, usually seen in aortic stenosis and hypertension
    - Thrusting (volume overload) - a diffuse, non-sustained impulse, common in mitral regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy
    - Tapping

Parasternal heave:

Parasternal heave is palpated at lower left sternal border

Normally, parasternal impulse is impalpable, but may be detected as a palpated in patients with severe right heart hypertrophy or severe left atrial dilatation (displacing the right ventricle anteriorly.

Thrills:

Assess for thrills in the four palpable areas, which are vibrations associated with heart murmurs

**Auscultation**

Auscultation with diaphragm should be done for the mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve and aortic valve

Mitral stenosis (auscultate cardiac apex with bell in left lateral position) - Low pitched, late diastolic murmur with an opening snap

Mitral regurgitation - Pan-Systolic murmur/ Holosystolic murmur with a blowing quality, radiating to axilla. If it does not radiate to axilla, think of gallavardin phenomenon seen in aortic stenosis

Aortic regurgitation (best heard in deep expiration position) - Early diastolic murmur, best heard at left parasternal border at 3rd/4th intercostal space

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZysrKXHJMM&ab_channel=Medzcool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZysrKXHJMM&ab_channel=Medzcool)

Aortic stenosis - Systolic click and systolic murmur which radiates to carotids (Auscultate for carotid bruits with bell), S2 is deminished

For mitral murmurs, turn the patient to a left lateral position

For aortic murmurs, ask the patient to sit up and hold breath at expiration
