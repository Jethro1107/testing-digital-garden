### Arterial supply of the stomach

The stomach is supplied by the celiac trunk. Note that [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/The celiac trunk gives rise to 3 branches\|The celiac trunk gives rise to 3 branches]], where all are involved in supplying the stomach.

The three branches:

The left hepatic artery, which follows the lesser curvature of the stomach.

The splenic artery, which gives rise to the left gastro-omental artery that follows the greater curvature.

The common hepatic artery, which gives rise to the right gastric artery, which follows the lesser curvature of the stomach.

The common hepatic artery branches to give the hepatic artery proper, which branches to give the gastroduodenal artery. The gastroduodenal artery gives rise to the right gastro-omental artery.
