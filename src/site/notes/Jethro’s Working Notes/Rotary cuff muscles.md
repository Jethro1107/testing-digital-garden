### Rotary cuff muscles

Rotary cuff muscles is a group of muscles that *serves an important function, the stabilization of the [[Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)\|Shoulder joint (Glenohumeral [[joint)]]]]*. Another function of these muscles is to produce movement at these joints.

The rotary cuff muscles consist of 3 muscles on the posterior scapular region: **Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus and Teres minor**, and 1 muscle on the anterior scapular region, the ****************************subscapularis****************************.

- **************************Supraspinatus**************************
    
    The supraspinatus originates from the supraspinous fossa and inserts onto the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus.
    
    It **********************************************initiates abduction of the gleonohumeral joint**********************************************. The supraspinatus is involved in abduction of the shoulder joint from 0 to 45 degrees, while the deltoid muscle carries out the rest of the abduction. [[Full abduction of the arm requires action of 4 muscles\|Full abduction of the arm requires action of 4 muscles]].

- **************************Infraspinatus**************************
    
    The infraspinatus originates from the infraspinous fossa and insert at the middle facet on the posterior surface of the greater tubercle of the humerus.
    
    It enables lateral rotation of the glenohumeral joint.

- **********************Teres minor**********************
    
    Teres minor originates from the upper 2/3 of the lateral border of the scapulae and inserts onto the inferior facet on the posterior surface of the greater tubercle of the humerus.
    
    It enables lateral rotation of the glenohumeral joint. Contrasting with the [[Jethroâ€™s Working Notes/Teres major\|Teres major]], which enables medial rotation, this is because the teres minor inserts posteriorly while the teres major inserts anteriorly.

- **************************Subscapularis**************************
    
    The subscapularis originates from the subscapular fossa and inserts onto the lesser tubercle of the humerus (which is only present anteriorly).
    
    It enables medial rotation of the shoulder joint.
