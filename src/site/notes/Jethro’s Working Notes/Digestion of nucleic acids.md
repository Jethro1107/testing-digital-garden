### Digestion of nucleic acids

Nucleic acid is digested into nucleotides by pancreatic enzymes (ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease). 

Nucleotides are further broken down into nucleosides and phosphates by intestinal phosphatase (an intestinal brush border enzyme).

Nucleosides are broken down into nitrogenous bases and pentose by intestinal nucleosidase (an intestinal brush border enzyme).
