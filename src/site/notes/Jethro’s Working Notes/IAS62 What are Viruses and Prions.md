### Viral Structure

- What is a virus?
    
    A non-living organism with genetic material (composed of either DNA or RNA) packaged into a protein containing coat.
    
    It is very small, and can only be visualised by electron microscopy.
    
- What is the structure of a viral particle?
    
    The viral genome (a set of viral genes) is surrounded by matrix proteins/viral enzymes, which is surrounded by another layer, the capsid
    
    Some viruses have an additional covering, an envelope, which is derived from the lipid bilayer membrane of the host cell
    
    Hence, viruses can be classified into enveloped viruses and non-enveloped viruses/naked capsid virus
    
- Describe the diversity in genome structure in viruses.
    
    Viral genome can be DNA or RNA, single-stranded or double stranded, linear or circular
    
- How many genes do viruses typically have?
    
    Around 100, but viruses like Hepatitis B virus have fewer than 10 genes
    

### Viral Replication

- Describe the steps of the virus replication cycle.
    
    Attachment (adsorption) - Mediated by receptors, giving viruses host specificity and tissue trophism
    
    Penetration - entry into the cell
    
    Uncoating - Release of nucleic acid
    
    Viral protein synthesis
    
    Viral nucleic acid replication
    
    Viral assembly
    
    Viral release
    
- Describe the process of  DNA viral replication.
    
    Viral DNA (ds) is transcribed in the nucleus into viral RNA
    
    Viral mRNA is translated in the cytoplasm to give rise to viral protein
    
- Describe the process of RNA viral replication.
    
    RNA dependent RNA polymerase mediates the exchange between +ve RNA and -ve RNA
    
    +ve RNA serves as viral mRNA and can be translated into viral protein
    
- Describe the process of retroviral replication.
    
    Viral RNA cannot serve viral mRNA for direct translation
    
    Viral RNA must undergo reverse transcription under action of reverse transcriptase into proviral DNA
    
    Proviral DNA is then transcribed by transcriptase into Viral mRNA
    
    Viral mRNA is translated into viral protein
    

### Virus Diseases

- What are the five stages of infection?
    
    Incubation period
    
    Prodromal Period
    
    Specific Illness Period
    
    Decline Period
    
    Covalescence
    
- What is the incubation period?
    
    Incubation period - The time interval between entry of virus into the body (exposure) and the commencement of disease symptoms
    
    In simple terms, it is the time period after you encounter the virus and before you get sick
    
    The viral replication cycle kicks in, causing an increase in virus number to cause damage, which would lead to the commencement of disease symptoms
    
- What is viral shedding? What is its significance in disease transmission?
    
    Viral shedding is the period which involves the release of viruses
    
    It represents the period of infectivity, when disease transmission is possible
    
    The viral shedding pattern differs in different disease and individuals, sometimes, it overlaps with the incubation period, making the disease more communicable
    
    Understanding the period of infectivity is essential for adoption of control measures in a timely measure to prevent transmissions.
    
- What is pathogenesis? What are the different factors contributing to pathogenesis?
    
    Pathogenesis - A series of events and processes that combine to produce disease
    
    Factors:
    
    Ecology of virus and host - Affects exposure and chance of infection
    
    Population dynamics of virus an host - Seasonality of virus
    
    Modes of transmission
    
    Virus virulence
    
- What is a localised viral infection? Why can disease symptoms be systemic despite a localised infection?
    
    Localised viral infection refers to infection in which the virus multiplies locally near the site of entry
    
- What is a systemic viral infection?
    
    It starts with localised infection of virus, in which the virus multiplies locally at site of entry
    
    The virus then spreads via bloodstream or other means (e.g. along the peripheral nerves) to distant site
    
    The virus then localises in target organs (tissue tropism), causing organ damage
    
- What is viraemia?
    
    Presence of virus in blood
    
    Acute viraemia - In early phase of many disseminated virus infections
    
    Chronic viraemia - Hepatitis B, HIV
    
- What is cell/organ tropism of a virus?
    
    Ability of virus to infect a particular cell due to presence of required receptor
    
- What is the pathological mechanisms of viral disease?
    
    Cytolysis:
    
    Uncontrolled viral replication
    
    Switch off host cell function by hijacking cellular mechanism
    
    Induce apoptosis
    
    Immunopathological:
    
    Host immune response cause pathological changes
    
    Oncogenesis
    

### Viral Diagnosis

- What are the methods of viral diagnosis?
    
    Detect the virus:
    
    Visualization by microscopy
    
    Culturing the virus
    
    Viral antigen detection
    
    Viral nucleic acid detection
    
    Viral inclusion bodies
    
    Detect the host antibody response
    
- How are viruses visualised in a laboratory?
    
    By Electron microscopy
    
    Requires sufficient concentration of virus, thus a good sample is needed
    
- What are the different methods of culturing viruses?
    
    Inject live animals (past method)
    
    Embryonated egg inoculation (past method)
    
    This are methods of the past as they do not guarantee success, as viruses have high host specificity
    
    Virus culture in cell line - After culturing, observe virus cytopathic effect (cell death, giant cell formation)
    
- Why is a virus transport medium required after sampling and before culturing?
    
    To preserve infectivity of virus such that they can still infect the cells
    
- What are the components of viral transport medium?
    
    pH buffer - to prevent denaturation of viral proteins, which may affect infectivity
    
    Protein - to maintain virus stability
    
    Antibiotics - prevent bacterial overgrowth in the sample
    
- What are the two methods of viral antigen detection?
    
    Direct method - primary antibody covalently bound with a fluorophore binds to the antigen, used when sufficient antigen is present
    
    Indirect method - primary antibody bind to antigen, secondary antibody covalently bound with a fluorophore bind to Fc region of the primary antibody. Since more than one secondary body can bind to the Fc region of the primary body, the indirect method can amplify the fluorescence signal, and is hence used when there is insufficient antigen  
    
- How is viral nucleic acid detection carried out?
    
    Amplify target DNA by polymerase chain reaction, and run a gel electrophoresis
    
    Presence of a specific band indicates presence of virus in the sample
    
    For RNA virus, there is a need to carry out reverse transcription to produce complementary virus DNA (vDNA) before doing PCR
    
    The thickness of band correlates with viral load
    
- What are viral inclusion bodies? How do they aid laboratory diagnosis?
    
    Viral inclusion bodies refer to the condensation of viral proteins and viral RNA to a particular site of a cell
    
    Presence of inclusion of bodies indicate viral infection
    
- What do different types of antibody response indicate?
    
    IgG antibody indicates infection at some time during lifetime, but cannot confirm recent infection
    
    To use IgG antibody to confirm recent infection, a paired sera 10-14 days apart to detect IgG titre is required
    
    a 4-fold increase of IgG concentration is required to confirm a recent infection
    
    Alternatively, IgM antibody detection can be used to confirm a recent infection (1-3 months), as it is produced earlier in an infection and has a shorter half-life
    

### Defective Viruses

- What is a defective virus?
    
    A virus that does not encode all the structural protein required for viral replication
    
    A helper virus is required to provide key genes to complete virus replication cycle
    
    Example:
    
    Hepatitis D virus using surface antigen of hepatitis B virus
    

### Prions

- What is prion?
    
    An infectious misfolded protein
    
    A prion can induce misfolding of other protein (infectious)
    
- What are diseases caused by prions?
    
    Mad Cow disease
    
    Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
