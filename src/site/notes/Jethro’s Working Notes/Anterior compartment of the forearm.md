### Anterior compartment of the forearm

Anterior compartment of the forearm consist consist of 8 muscles arranged in 3 layers, the superficial layer, the intermediate layer and the deep layer. These muscles are largely associated with:

- Flexion of the [[Wrist joint (radiocarpal [[joint)\|Wrist joint (radiocarpal [[joint)]]]], i.e. Plantarflexion
- Flexion of the fingers
- Pronation

### Superficial layer of the anterior compartment of the forearm

There are 4 muscles in the superficial layer of the anterior compartment of the forearm, which share the same ******origin******, the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Proceeding medially to laterally, 1) ********************Flexor carpi ulnaris********************, 2) *Palmaris longus*, 3) *********************Flexor carpi radialis*********************, 4) ***************Pronator teres.***************

- **Flexor carpi ulnaris**
    
    The flexor carpi ulnaris is the most medial muscle of the anterior compartment of the forearm. It’s humeral head originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus, and its ulnar head originates from the olecranon and posterior border of the ulna. It inserts at the pisiform, hook of halmate and the base of the 5th metacarpal.

    It enables flexion and adduction (ulnar deviation) of the wrist.
    
- ******************************Palmaris longus******************************
    
    The palmaris longus is a vestigal muscle, only present in some individuals.
    
    It originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus, and produces a long tendon that inserts onto the flexor retinaculum (a specialised deep fascia that connects between the scaphoid and trapezium, and the pisiform and hook of halmate) and the palmar aponeurosis (a dense triangular fascia that protects the palm).
    
    It enables flexion of the wrist.

- ****************Flexor carpi radialis****************
    
    The flexor carpi radialis lies lateral to the palmaris longus.
    
    It originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and produces a long tendon, that lies just lateral to the midline. The tendon inserts at the 2nd and 3rd metacarpal. ********************************************************This tendon is closely associated with the radial pulse.********************************************************

    It enables flexion and abduction (radial deviation) of the wrist.
    
- ****************************Pronator teres****************************
    
    The pronator teres has its origins at the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the medial side of the coracoid process of the ulna. It inserts at the lateral side of the midshaft of the radius.

    It enables pronation.
    
    The pronator teres forms the medial margins of the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Cubital fossa\|Cubital fossa]]. The [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Median nerve\|Median nerve]] and the [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Ulnar artery\|Ulnar artery]] leaves the cubital fossa by passing between the 2 layers of the pronator teres.
    

### Intermediate layer of the anterior compartment of the forearm

The intermediate layer lies deep to the superficial layer. It consist of 1 muscle, the **flexor digitorum superficialis**.

The flexor digitorum superficialis has two heads:

- The humero-ulnar head, which originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the medial edge of the coranoid process of the ulna.
- The radial head, which originates from the anterior oblique line of the radius.

The two heads fuse to form a muscle belly, which gives off 4 tendons for the 4 medial fingers distally that passes through the carpal tunnel.

The tendons for the 4 fingers are not arranged on the same plane. The tendon for the 3rd and 4th digits lie anterior/ lie superfical to that of the 2nd and the 5th digits.

At the middle phalanges, each tendon splits into the 2 slips that insert posteriorly to the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus, to the side of the middle phalanges.

The flexor digitorum superficialis enables flexion of the proximal interphalangial joints of the 2nd to 5th digits.

### Deep layer of anterior compartment of the forearm

There are 3 muscles in the deep layer of the anterior compartment of the forearm, they are: 1) **************************Flexor digitorum profundus**************************, 2) ****************Flexor pollicis longus****************, 3) *************Pronator quadratus*************.

- ************************Flexor digitorum profundus************************
    
    The flexor digitorum profudus originates from the anterior and medial surface of the ulnar, and at the distal forearm, gives off 4 tendons for the 4 medial fingers, which pass through the carpal tunnel, deep to the tendon of the *********************************flexor digitorum superficialis*********************************.
    
    *******************************************The tendons are arranged in the same plane.*******************************************
    
    The tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus pass through a split formed by the tendons of the ******************flexor digitorum superficialis****************** and insert at the distal phalanges of digits 2-5.

    It enables the flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint of digits 2-5.
    
- ********************************************Flexor pollicis longus********************************************
    
    The flexor pollicis longus originates from the anterior surface of the radius, and at the distal forearm, gives off a single tendon for the thumb, which passes through the carpal tunnel and lies lateral to the tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis and the flexor digitorum profundus.
    
    The tendon inserts at the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb.

    The pronator quadratus originates from the distal 1/4 of the ulna and inserts at the the distal 1/4 of the radius.
