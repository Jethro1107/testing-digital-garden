### Cirrhosis
- **What is cirrhosis?**
    Cirrhosis is a characteristic morphological change of end stage liver disease. It is a diffuse process that refers to the transformation of the liver into regenerative parenchymal nodules surrounded by fibrous bands of connective tissue.
- **Etiology of cirrhosis**
    Leading causes of chronic liver disease manifested as cirrhosis includes;
    - Viral hepatitis - Chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\|Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]]
    - [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Alcoholic liver disease\|Alcoholic liver disease]]
- **Complications of cirrhosis**
    Cirrhosis results in portal hypertension, resulting in porto-systemic shunting via the portosystemic anastamosis:
    - Esophageal varices - Increases the risk of fatal hematemesis in cases of variceal bleeding
    - Ascites
    - Splenomegaly and hypersplenism - Results in sequesteration of blood cells, leading to mild pancytopenia or thrombocytopenia (coagulopathy)
    - Hepato-renal syndrome
    - Porto-systemic shunting results in Hepatic encephalopathy due to failure to eliminate nitrogen-metaboites such as ammonia. It results in a host of abnormalities such as flapping tremor, confusion or coma.
    Many Chronic Liver diseases also increases risk of development of [[Jethro’s Working Notes/Hepatocellular carcinoma\|Hepatocellular carcinoma]].
