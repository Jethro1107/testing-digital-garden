### Concept of sympathetic splanchnic nerves

Sympathetic splanchnic nerves are nerves that arise from the sympathetic trunk, sending preganglionic nerve fibres to synapse at abdominal ganglion.

- **There are 4 sympathetic splanchnic nerves:**
    
    Greater splanchnic nerves - Arising from T5-T9, it consist of preganglionic sympathetic fibres that connects to celiac and superior mesenteric ganglia and plexus.
    
    Lesser splanchnic nerves - Arising from T10-T11, it consist of preganglionic sympathetic fibres that connects to celiac and superior mesenteric ganglia and plexus.
    
    Least splanchnic nerves - Arising from T12, it consist of preganglionic sympathetic fibres that connects to aorticorenal and inferior mesenteric ganglia.
    
    Lumbar splanchnic nerves - Arising from L1-L2, it consist of preganglionic sympathetic fibres that connects to the inferior mesenteric and hypogastric ganglia and plexus.
