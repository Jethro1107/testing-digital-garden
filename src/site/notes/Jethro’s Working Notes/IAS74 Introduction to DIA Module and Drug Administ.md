### Drug Administration

- What are the different routes of drug administration?
    
    Parenteral (IV, SC, IM), Implants, Oral, Buccal, Topical, Rectal, Vaginal, Inhalation, Nasal, Eye drops and ear drops
    

### Parenteral Route

- What is parental route? How can it be classified?
    
    Parental route - Drugs are directly injected into the body to achieve systemic effect
    
    Intravenous route - Drugs are injected directly into the systemic circulation via veins
    
    Subcutaneous route - Drugs are injected into the subcutaneous layer of the skin
    
    Intramuscular route - Drugs are injected into muscle layers
    
- What are the dosage forms available for parenteral route?
    
    Solutions (Unstable)
    
    Powder (Stable, reconstituted into solution before administration by dissolving into normal saline)
    
    Emulsion (Water in oil, or oil in water)
    
    Suspensions (Large molecular size of drugs)
    

**Intravenous Route**

- What is drug administration via the intravenous route?
    
    Drugs are directly injected into the systemic circulation via the veins
    
- Compare IV injection and IV infusion.
    
    IV injection - Intravenous administration of a small volume of fluid rapidly at one time
    
    IV infusion - Intravenous administration of a large volume of fluid at a slow rate and ensures that the drug enters the general circulation at a constant rate, facilitated by an automatic pump
    
- What are the factors affecting rate of IV infusion.
    
    Fluid is subjected to gravity
    
    Factors affecting rate of IV infusion:
    
    - Physical characteristic of fluid - Viscosity, Density
    - Fluid pressure - depends on volume
    - Height of infusion above patient - Height increase, rate increase
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of IV injection and infusion?
    
    Advantages:
    
    Rapid onset of action â‡’ live saving
    
    100% bioavailability
    
    Administer drugs with poor oral absorption (large molecular size, ionic)
    
    Deliver drugs to unconscious ptients
    
    Disadvantages:
    
    Trained personnel required to give IV injections as it may be difficult to find a suitable vein
    
    Cannot be used to administer water in oil emulsions as it may block blood vessels
    
    Cannot be used to administer suspensions
    
- Describe the administration procedure of IV administration.
    
    Fluid generally administered into superficial vein on the back of the hand or in the internal flexure of the elbow
    
    If large volume of fluid is administered, consider subclavian vein (Central line)
    
    Central line may cause bleeding and infection, which can be avoided by peripheral inserted central catheter
    

**Subcutaneous Route**

- What is drug administration via the subcutaneous route?
    
    Injection of small volume of solution, emulsion, or suspension into the subcutaneous layer (loose connective and adipose tissue) directly under the skin
    
- Compare absorption rate of SC administration and IV administration. Account for the differences.
    
    Slower than IV administration but still very fast
    
    It takes for drug to reach the capillaries and pass through the endothelial cells and basement membrane forming the capillaries before entering the blood
    
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of subcutaneous injection?
    
    Advantages:
    
    Can be self-administered by patients
    
    Complete absorption
    
    Disadvantages:
    
    Can be painful due to many nerve endings on subcutaneous layer
    
    May cause lipohypertrophy or lipoatrophy upon continuous administration
    
    Small volume
    
- Describe the administration procedure of SC administration.
    
    Injection into abdomen, upper back, upper arms and the lateral upper hips
    
- What are the factors affecting drug absorption?
    - Site of injection - If more adipocytes, rate of drug absorption decrease
    - Temperature - Affects blood flow and rate of drug absorption
    - Age of patient - Affects subcutaneous fat layer
    - Degree of massaging - Promotes blood flow and absorption

**Intramuscular injection**

- What is drug administration via the intramuscular route?
    
    Solutions, or suspensions are administered directly into the body of relaxed muscles
    
- Compare absorption rate of IM administration to the other two forms of parenteral administration.
    
    Slower than IV, but faster than SC, as site of IM injection tends to be closer to blood vessels than SC injection
    
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of intramuscular injection?
    
    Advantages:
    
    Larger volume of injection than SC injection
    
    Fast onset of action
    
    Disadvantage:
    
    Trained personnel required for injection
    
    Site of injection will influence absorption as different muscles vary in blood supply
    
- Describe the administration procedure of IM administration.
    
    Injected into gluteal muscles, deltoid muscles and vastus lateralis of the thigh
    
- What are the factors affecting site of injection?
    
    In adults, gluteal muscles is used as it can tolerate a larger volume, as it is a bigger muscle
    
    In infants, vastus lateralis is used as it is more developed
    
    For rapid absorption, deltoid muscle is used
    

**Other Types of Injection**

- What are the other types of injection?
    
    Intradermal:
    
    Small volume injection into the skin between the epidermis and the dermis
    
    Slow absorption
    
    Used for diagnostic test for allergy or immunity
    
    Intra-arterial:
    
    Theoretically faster drug administration due to faster blood flow
    
    Can be used to target specific organ that is served by the artery
    
    Not practical as it is difficult to identify artery due to their deep position in the body
    
    Intracardiac:
    
    Injection of aqueous solution into a ventricle or the cardiac muscle for local effect
    
    Use for emergency
    
    Intraspinal:
    
    Injection of aqueous solution less than 20ml into particular areas of the spinal cord, namely subarachnoid and epidural
    
    Intra-articular:
    
    Injection of aqueous solution or suspension into the synovial fluid of the joint, for local administration of anti-inflammatory drugs
    

### Implants

- What are implants?
    
    Implants are sterile solid dose form inserted under the skin by a small surgical incision
    
    The release of drugs from implant is slow, allowing for long term therapy
    
- What are implants used for?
    
    Hormone replacement therapy or as contraceptives
    

### Oral Route

- What are the different effects that can be achieved by oral route of administration?
    
    Local effect (within GI), systemic effect (if absorbed and distributed)
    
- What are the dosage forms available?
    
    Liquid dosage forms:
    
    Solutions, Suspensions, Emulsions
    
    Solid dosage forms:
    
    Tablets, capsules, powder
    
- What are the advantages of using oral route?
    
    Simple and self-administration allowed
    
    Safe
    
    Portable
    
    Painless
    
    Cheap - As no need to sterilize and production is automated
    
- What are the disadvantages of using oral route?
    - Slow onset
    - Drugs destroyed by enzymes in GI tract
    - Absorption affected by irregular GI conditions (Inflammation and Diarrhoea)
    - First pass effect:
        
        Drugs absorbed are first transported to the liver, in which some drugs may be metabolise, causing loss of function
        
        Higher dose by be required to overcome first pass effect
        
    - Drug solubility may be affected by other substances in the GI tract, affecting absorption:
        
        Calcium in antacid can chelate with tetracycline, reducing its absorption
        
    - Food and GI mobility may hinder absorption
    - Not suitable for unconcious or vomiting patients
    - Not suitable for preoperative and postoperative use, as anaesthesia can induce vomiting
- What are the advantages of using liquid oral dosage forms?
    
    Much easier to swallow
    
    Medication readily absorbed in GI tract
    
- What are the advantages of using solid dosage forms?
    
    Less bulky and more convenient to carry around
    
    More chemically stable
    
    Accuracy of oral dosage
    
    Coating can mask unpleasant taste (sugar coating)
    
- Compare Enteric coated tablets and sustained release tablets.
    
    Enteric coated tablets - Coating degrade in alkali conditions but do not degrade in acid conditions
    
    Usually used for drugs degraded by gastric juice, or could irritate the gastric mucosa
    
    Drugs will not be released in the stomach, but in the intestine due to the property of the coating
    
    Avoid antacid which may alter stomach pH, causing drugs to be released in stomach instead
    
    Sustained release tablets - Tablet surrounded by a polymer which retards drug release
    
    Drugs can be released slowly to provide drug action the whole day
    

### Buccal Route

- What are the different effects that can be achieved by buccal route of administration?
    
    Local effects - lozenge for sore throat
    
    Systemic effect - Saliva can dissolve drugs, and high vascular nature of tongue and buccal cavity promotes drug absorption
    
- What are the dosage forms available?
    
    Buccal tablets
    
    Lozenge
    
    Pastilles
    
- What are the advantages of buccal route of administration?
    
    Fast onset of action due to rapid absorption - Due to good blood supply in buccal cavity
    
    No First Pass - Bypass liver such that drugs are not subjected to first pass effect
    
    Drug stability - Neutral pH in blood makes drug more stable
    
    Can be administered to unconscious and vomiting patients
    
- What are the disadvantages of buccal route of administration?
    
    Holding dose in mouth is inconvenient 
    
    If any is swallowed, or treated as oral dose, the portion of drug will be subjected to first pass metabolism

**Systemic Effect (Transdermal Route)**

- What are the advantages of topical route of administration?
    
    No First Pass effect
    
    No drug deactivation in the skin
    
- What are the limitations of topical route of administration?
    
    Only potent drugs can be used, as skin permeability to drugs is low
