### Mechanism of Wound Healing

- Describe the tissue response to injury.
    
    Haemostasis → Acute inflammation → Demolition → Healing/Repair → Resolution
    
    Haemostasis involves the formation of a blood clot to stop bleeding
    
    Acute inflammation occurs after an inciting stimulus
    
    Demolition of necrotic debris, bacteria, dust in the wound by neutrophils
    
    Healing/Repair only proceed once the inciting stimulus is removed
    
    Resolution is achieved after healing of the wound
    
- What is healing?
    
    Healing is the Body's replacement of damaged tissue by living tissue, involving the process of both repair and regeneration
    
- What is repair?
    
    Repair is the replacement of lost tissue by granulation tissue
    
    Granulation tissue eventually matures to form scar/fibrous tissue
    
- What are the components of granulation tissue?
    
    Proliferating capillaries - Angiogenesis to supply O2 and nutrients to support repair and remove metabolic wastes
    
    Fibroblast and Myofibroblasts - Fibroblasts that act like muscles to draw wound edges together
    
    Macrophage - For demolition of cell debris and dead neutrophils
    
    ECM (particularly type III collagen) - deposited by fibroblasts under stimulation by TGF-beta
    
- What is regeneration?
    
    Regeneration is the replacement of lost tissue by similar tissue types, involving the proliferation of the surrounding undamaged specialised cells
    
- Describe the regenerative capacities of different somatic cells.
    
    Labile cells - Constantly in the cell cycle and dividing as they are constantly lost and replaced by new maturing cells
    
    Stable cells - Remains quiescent in G0 stage of cell cycle, but readily reenter G1 stage of cell cycle in response to injury
    
    Permanent cells -Terminally differentiated, non proliferative cells that exit cell cycle and cannot reenter

- What is the mechanism of wound healing?
    
    Migration and regeneration of parenchymal cells (Regeneration)
    
    Migration and proliferation of connective tissue cell (Repair)
    
    Synthesis of ECM proteins
    
    Remodelling of connective tissue and parenchyma
    
    Collagenization and acquisition of wound strength
    
- What are the different mechanisms that mediate wound healing?
    
    Growth factors (released during the inflammatory process):
    
    Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) - Involved in formation of granulation tissue
    
    Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) - Involved in formation of granulation tissue
    
    Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) - Involved in synthesis and deposition of ECM proteins
    
    EGF - Involved in mitogenesis
    
    Cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction:
    
    ECM can stimulate proliferation, migration of cells, and stop proliferation after the defect caused by injury has been healed
    
    ECM synthesis and collagenization:
    
    Fibroblast secrets extracellular matrix components, e.g. Proteoglycans, type 3 collagen
    
    Outcome of ECM synthesis is affected by synthesis and degradation of ECM protein, modulated by matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMPs)
    
    Type 3 collagen is eventually replaced by type 1 collagen to form a permanent scar
    
- Describe the stages of healing of skin wounds.
    
    Formation of scab and acute inflammation
    
    Demolition
    
    Regeneration of epithelial covering and formation of granulation tissue
    
    Deposition of collagen
    
    Resorption of capillaries
    
    Formation of scar
    
- Describe the stages of healing of bone fractures.
    
    Hematoma formation and inflammation
    
    Demolition
    
    Formation of granulation tissue
    
    Callus (new bone) formation to bridge the gap of fracture 
    
    Formation of lamellar bone by remodelling
    
    Remodelling (mediated by osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity)
    

### Factors Affecting Wound Healing

- What is healing by primary intension and healing of secondary intension?
    
    Healing by primary intention refers to healing of a clean incision wound, the wound edges are close together
    
    Healing by secondary intention refers to healing of an open wound in which wound edges re far apart
    
- What is the difference in the process of healing of secondary intension when compared with healing by primary intention?
    
    Greater tissue lost
    
    More inflammatory exudate as there is more necrotic material to remove
    
    More granulation tissue ⇒ larger scar
    
    Requirement of wound contraction to reduce wound site
    
    Slower process ⇒ Increased liability to infection
    
- What are the local factors affecting wound healing?
    
    Type of wound
    
    Apposition of wound margins
    
    Blood supply
    
    Infection, presence of foreign body, prolonging inflammation
    
    Previous irradiation, prolonging inflammation
    
- What are the general factors affecting wound healing?
    
    Poor nutrition (protein, vitamin C deficiency)
    
    Steroid administration (Anti-inflammatory, reduced TGF-beta production ⇒ weakened scar)
    
    Systemic disease (diabetes mellitus, renal failure, cachexia)
    
    UV light accelerates healing
    
- What are the complications in wound healing? (7)
    
    Infection
    
    Wound dehiscence
    
    Keloid formation - Excessive scar tissue formed
    
    Painful scars - Nerve endings severed, formation of traumatic neuroma, a nodule of nerve endings
    
    Weak scars - Due to excessive motion or tension on wound, weakening the wound, causing hernia
    
    Pigmentation - accumulation of hemosiderin
    
    Cicatrization - scarring in tubular structures causing narrowing of the lumen
    

### Healing of Specific Tissues

- What are the factors affecting the outcome of healing?
    
    Regenerative capacity of specialized cells
    
    Type and extent of injury
    
    Extent of damage to ECM
    
- Describe the process of liver cirrhosis.
    
    Infarction of liver results in tissue damage of hepatocyte and connective tissue, as a result, granulation tissue is required in repair, and scar tissue is formed.
    
    Regenerating hepatocytes are surrounded by fibrous bands, resulting nodules and hence cirrhosis.
    
- Describe the process of healing after tubular necrosis.
    
    Tubular necrosis only involves the death of tubular cells, but not the ECM, which are epithelial cells, which can regeneration. Since ECM is not damaged, there is minimal granulation and thus no scarring. Hence, kidney can restore normal function after healing.
    
- Describe the regenerative capacity of cartilage, tendon and muscle.
    
    Regeneration of cartilage is poor
    
    Regeneration of tendon is good but slow
    
    Regenerative capacity of muscle depends on type of muscle:
    
    None in cardiac muscles
    
    Skeletal muscle regenerate by means of muscle satellite cells
    
    Smooth muscle cells have high regenerative capacity
    
- Describe the healing of peripheral nerves after nerve transection.
    
    Neurons are permanent cells and cannot proliferate, but regeneration is made possible by sprouting of axons
    
    Nerve transaction (not near the cell body as it might kill the neuron) results in Wallerian degeneration, consisting of degeneration of axon and secondary demyelination distal to the transection
    
    Regeneration involves sprouting of axons, and schwann cell proliferation and myelination of new axon
    
    If there is good apposition, good regeneration occurs
    
    If there is poor apposition, there is irregular sprouting of axon and proliferation of schwann cells, resulting in a painful traumatic neuroma
    
- Explain why there is regain of some function after a stroke.
    
    In a stroke, infarction in the brain triggers inflammation, resulting in oedema, affecting a large functioning region of the bring
    
    After inflammation subside, oedema is absent, and the affected functioning region decreases in area
    
    However, the necrotic tissue remain (infarct) cannot regenerate
    
- What are stem cells? What are the two important important properties of stem cells?
    
    Unspecialized cells capable of renewing themselves by cell division
    
    Can be induced to become tissue or organ specific cells with special functions
    
    Self renewal and Asymmetric division
    
- What are the advantages of using embryonic stem cells?
    
    Versatile and can cultured more rapidly
    
- What are the disadvantages of using embryonic stem cells?
    
    Difficult to coax into specialization
    
    Risk of rejection 
    
    Danger of forming tumour
    
    Danger of disease transmission
    
    Involves killing embryos
    
- What are the advantages of using adult stem cells?
    
    Easier to coax into specialization
    
    Lower risk of rejection
    
    Less risk of forming tumour
    
- What are the disadvantages of using adult stem cells?
    
    More finite lifespan
